28 Every object in the next day s journey was new and interesting to Elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight
Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants
Mrs Collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received
She saw instantly that her cousin s manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family
Elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him
But though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion
To work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and Elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible
It was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave Charlotte all the credit
When Mr Collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by Charlotte s evident enjoyment of it Elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten
She had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the country
The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed Elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon Charlotte s degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well
Elizabeth asked questions in vain Maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the dining room which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder It was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate
cried Elizabeth
I like her appearance said Elizabeth struck with other ideas
She looks sickly and cross
Yes she will do for him very well
She will make him a very proper wife
Mr Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and Sir William to Elizabeth s high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way
