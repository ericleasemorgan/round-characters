IX Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles
The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity
She must have delighted the Coles worthy people who deserved to be made happy
And left a name behind her that would not soon die away
Perfect happiness even in memory is not common and there were two points on which she was not quite easy
She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax s feelings to Frank Churchill
It was hardly right but it had been so strong an idea that it would escape her and his submission to all that she told was a compliment to her penetration which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue
Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her though fearful of its producing Mr Elton
I do not know what she meant but she asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer
She meant to be impertinently curious just as such an Anne Cox should be
She said he was very agreeable the day he dined there
He sat by her at dinner
Emma thought it most prudent to go with her
Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible and in her present state would be dangerous
Harriet tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word was always very long at a purchase and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind Emma went to the door for amusement
Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury Mr Perry walking hastily by Mr William Cox letting himself in at the office door Mr Cole s carriage horses returning from exercise or a stray letter boy on an obstinate mule were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone and a string of dawdling children round the baker s little bow window eyeing the gingerbread she knew she had no reason to complain and was amused enough quite enough still to stand at the door
They were stopping however in the first place at Mrs Bates s whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford s and had all but knocked when Emma caught their eye
Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her and the agreeableness of yesterday s engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting
I am here on no business of my own said Emma I am only waiting for my friend
She will probably have soon done and then we shall go home
I do not believe any such thing replied Emma
Emma watched them in and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter trying with all the force of her own mind to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured and that a blue ribbon be it ever so beautiful would still never match her yellow pattern
Emma would be very happy to wait on Mrs Bates c and they did at last move out of the shop with no farther delay from Miss Bates than How do you do Mrs Ford
Emma wondered on what of all the medley she would fix
