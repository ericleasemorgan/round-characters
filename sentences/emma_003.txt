Not unfrequently through Emma s persuasion he had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him but evening parties were what he preferred and unless he fancied himself at any time unequal to company there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card table for him
These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect and happy was she for her father s sake in the power though as far as she was herself concerned it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs Weston
As she sat one morning looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day a note was brought from Mrs Goddard requesting in most respectful terms to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her a most welcome request for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen whom Emma knew very well by sight and had long felt an interest in on account of her beauty
She was a very pretty girl and her beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired
She was short plump and fair with a fine bloom blue eyes light hair regular features and a look of great sweetness and before the end of the evening Emma was as much pleased with her manners as her person and quite determined to continue the acquaintance
She was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith s conversation but she found her altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing shewing so proper and becoming a deference seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she had been used to that she must have good sense and deserve encouragement
They were a family of the name of Martin whom Emma well knew by character as renting a large farm of Mr Knightley and residing in the parish of Donwell very creditably she believed she knew Mr Knightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect
Miss Bates let Emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit
Emma allowed her father to talk but supplied her visitors in a much more satisfactory style and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy
