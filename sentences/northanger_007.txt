But my dearest Catherine what have you been doing with yourself all this morning
cried Catherine colouring
Catherine coloured and disclaimed again
But my dearest Catherine have you settled what to wear on your head tonight
But it does not signify if they do said Catherine very innocently
Very well Catherine
Catherine in some amazement complied and after remaining a few moments silent was on the point of reverting to what interested her at that time rather more than anything else in the world Laurentina s skeleton when her friend prevented her by saying For heaven s sake
Away they walked to the book and while Isabella examined the names it was Catherine s employment to watch the proceedings of these alarming young men
In a few moments Catherine with unaffected pleasure assured her that she need not be longer uneasy as the gentlemen had just left the pump room
Catherine readily agreed
Only she added perhaps we may overtake the two young men
Catherine had nothing to oppose against such reasoning and therefore to show the independence of Miss Thorpe and her resolution of humbling the sex they set off immediately as fast as they could walk in pursuit of the two young men
