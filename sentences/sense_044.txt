Elinor starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him obeyed the first impulse of her heart in turning instantly to quit the room and her hand was already on the lock when its action was suspended by his hastily advancing and saying in a voice rather of command than supplication Miss Dashwood for half an hour for ten minutes I entreat you to stay
Pray be quick sir said Elinor impatiently I have no time to spare
He was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation and seemed not to hear her
Elinor would not speak
For God s sake tell me is she out of danger or is she not
We hope she is
Elinor looked at him with greater astonishment than ever
She began to think that he must be in liquor the strangeness of such a visit and of such manners seemed no otherwise intelligible and with this impression she immediately rose saying Mr Willoughby I advise you at present to return to Combe
cried Elinor more and more at a loss to understand what he would be at
The steadiness of his manner and the intelligence of his eye as he spoke convincing Elinor that whatever other unpardonable folly might bring him to Cleveland he was not brought there by intoxication she said after a moment s recollection Mr Willoughby you _ ought _ to feel and I certainly _ do _ that after what has passed your coming here in this manner and forcing yourself upon my notice requires a very particular excuse
Elinor bowed her assent
I do not know said he after a pause of expectation on her side and thoughtfulness on his own how _ you _ may have accounted for my behaviour to your sister or what diabolical motive you may have imputed to me
You did then said Elinor a little softened believe yourself at one time attached to her
Yes I found myself by insensible degrees sincerely fond of her and the happiest hours of my life were what I spent with her when I felt my intentions were strictly honourable and my feelings blameless
Even _ then _ however when fully determined on paying my addresses to her I allowed myself most improperly to put off from day to day the moment of doing it from an unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were so greatly embarrassed
I have returned Elinor colouring likewise and hardening her heart anew against any compassion for him I have heard it all
I acknowledge that her situation and her character ought to have been respected by me
I do not mean to justify myself but at the same time can not leave you to suppose that I have nothing to urge that because she was injured she was irreproachable and because _ I _ was a libertine _ she _ must be a saint
If the violence of her passions the weakness of her understanding I do not mean however to defend myself
Her affection for me deserved better treatment and I often with great self reproach recall the tenderness which for a very short time had the power of creating any return
said Elinor reproachfully a note would have answered every purpose
Elinor first spoke
Did you tell her that you should soon return
I do not know what I told her he replied impatiently less than was due to the past beyond a doubt and in all likelihood much more than was justified by the future
Well sir said Elinor who though pitying him grew impatient for his departure and this is all
Did she show it you
Every line every word was in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer were she here would forbid a dagger to my heart
Elinor s heart which had undergone many changes in the course of this extraordinary conversation was now softened again yet she felt it her duty to check such ideas in her companion as the last
You are very wrong Mr Willoughby very blamable said Elinor while her voice in spite of herself betrayed her compassionate emotion you ought not to speak in this way either of Mrs Willoughby or my sister
Elinor made no answer
Her thoughts were silently fixed on the irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent habits of idleness dissipation and luxury had made in the mind the character the happiness of a man who to every advantage of person and talents united a disposition naturally open and honest and a feeling affectionate temper
Elinor assured him that she did that she forgave pitied wished him well was even interested in his happiness and added some gentle counsel as to the behaviour most likely to promote it
Were I even by any blessed chance at liberty again Elinor stopped him with a reproof
