VII The very day of Mr Elton s going to London produced a fresh occasion for Emma s services towards her friend
Emma was half ashamed of her friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful
Upon my word she cried the young man is determined not to lose any thing for want of asking
Emma was not sorry to be pressed
She read and was surprized
The style of the letter was much above her expectation
She paused over it while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her opinion with a Well well and was at last forced to add Is it a good letter
Yes indeed a very good letter replied Emma rather slowly so good a letter Harriet that every thing considered I think one of his sisters must have helped him
With a little reserve of manner Emma continued You mean to return a favourable answer I collect
For a little while Emma persevered in her silence but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that letter might be too powerful she thought it best to say I lay it down as a general rule Harriet that if a woman doubts as to whether she should accept a man or not she certainly ought to refuse him
Not for the world said Emma smiling graciously would I advise you either way
Emma waited the result with impatience but not without strong hopes
Emma felt the bad taste of her friend but let it pass with a very true and it would be a small consolation to her for the clownish manner which might be offending her every hour of the day to know that her husband could write a good letter
Emma assured her there would be no difficulty in the answer and advised its being written directly which was agreed to in the hope of her assistance and though Emma continued to protest against any assistance being wanted it was in fact given in the formation of every sentence
The looking over his letter again in replying to it had such a softening tendency that it was particularly necessary to brace her up with a few decisive expressions and she was so very much concerned at the idea of making him unhappy and thought so much of what his mother and sisters would think and say and was so anxious that they should not fancy her ungrateful that Emma believed if the young man had come in her way at that moment he would have been accepted after all
She was rather low all the evening but Emma could allow for her amiable regrets and sometimes relieved them by speaking of her own affection sometimes by bringing forward the idea of Mr Elton
Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully employed cried Emma
