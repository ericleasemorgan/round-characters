Marianne who had never much toleration for any thing like impertinence vulgarity inferiority of parts or even difference of taste from herself was at this time particularly ill disposed from the state of her spirits to be pleased with the Miss Steeles or to encourage their advances and to the invariable coldness of her behaviour towards them which checked every endeavour at intimacy on their side Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself which soon became evident in the manners of both but especially of Lucy who missed no opportunity of engaging her in conversation or of striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank communication of her sentiments
Lucy was naturally clever her remarks were often just and amusing and as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her agreeable but her powers had received no aid from education she was ignorant and illiterate and her deficiency of all mental improvement her want of information in the most common particulars could not be concealed from Miss Dashwood in spite of her constant endeavour to appear to advantage
Elinor saw and pitied her for the neglect of abilities which education might have rendered so respectable but she saw with less tenderness of feeling the thorough want of delicacy of rectitude and integrity of mind which her attentions her assiduities her flatteries at the Park betrayed and she could have no lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity with ignorance whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in conversation on terms of equality and whose conduct toward others made every show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly valueless
Elinor _ did _ think the question a very odd one and her countenance expressed it as she answered that she had never seen Mrs Ferrars
No returned Elinor cautious of giving her real opinion of Edward s mother and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent curiosity I know nothing of her
I am sure you think me very strange for enquiring about her in such a way said Lucy eyeing Elinor attentively as she spoke but perhaps there may be reasons I wish I might venture but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be impertinent
Elinor made her a civil reply and they walked on for a few minutes in silence
I am sorry I do _ not _ said Elinor in great astonishment if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her
But really I never understood that you were at all connected with that family and therefore I am a little surprised I confess at so serious an inquiry into her character
cried Elinor what do you mean
And she did not feel much delighted with the idea of such a sister in law
No replied Lucy not to Mr _ Robert _ Ferrars I never saw him in my life but fixing her eyes upon Elinor to his eldest brother
What felt Elinor at that moment
She turned towards Lucy in silent amazement unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration and though her complexion varied she stood firm in incredulity and felt in no danger of an hysterical fit or a swoon
Elinor for a few moments remained silent
Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words but at length forcing herself to speak and to speak cautiously she said with calmness of manner which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude May I ask if your engagement is of long standing
Elinor though greatly shocked still felt unable to believe it
I did not know said she that you were even acquainted till the other day
I think I have replied Elinor with an exertion of spirits which increased with her increase of emotion
Certainly answered Elinor without knowing what she said but after a moment s reflection she added with revived security of Edward s honour and love and her companion s falsehood Engaged to Mr Edward Ferrars
It is strange replied Elinor in a most painful perplexity that I should never have heard him even mention your name
Elinor s security sunk but her self command did not sink with it
Four years you have been engaged said she with a firm voice
Then taking a small miniature from her pocket she added To prevent the possibility of mistake be so good as to look at this face
She put it into her hands as she spoke and when Elinor saw the painting whatever other doubts her fear of a too hasty decision or her wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her mind she could have none of its being Edward s face
She returned it almost instantly acknowledging the likeness
You are quite in the right replied Elinor calmly
I certainly did not seek your confidence said Elinor but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on
As she said this she looked earnestly at Lucy hoping to discover something in her countenance perhaps the falsehood of the greatest part of what she had been saying but Lucy s countenance suffered no change
Here she took out her handkerchief but Elinor did not feel very compassionate
Pardon me replied Elinor startled by the question but I can give you no advice under such circumstances
No replied Elinor most feelingly sensible of every fresh circumstance in favour of Lucy s veracity I remember he told us that he had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth
I heard from him just before I left Exeter taking a letter from her pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor
Elinor saw that it _ was _ his hand and she could doubt no longer
This picture she had allowed herself to believe might have been accidentally obtained it might not have been Edward s gift but a correspondence between them by letter could subsist only under a positive engagement could be authorised by nothing else for a few moments she was almost overcome her heart sunk within her and she could hardly stand but exertion was indispensably necessary and she struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her feelings that her success was speedy and for the time complete
Yes _ I _ have one other comfort in his picture but poor Edward has not even _ that _
I did said Elinor with a composure of voice under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before
She was mortified shocked confounded
Fortunately for her they had now reached the cottage and the conversation could be continued no farther
After sitting with them a few minutes the Miss Steeles returned to the Park and Elinor was then at liberty to think and be wretched
