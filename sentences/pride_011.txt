11 When the ladies removed after dinner Elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawing room where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and Elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared
Elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight
In the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to Elizabeth said Miss Eliza Bennet let me persuade you to follow my example and take a turn about the room
Elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately
He was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book
She was dying to know what could be his meaning
and asked Elizabeth whether she could at all understand him
Not at all was her answer but depend upon it he means to be severe on us and our surest way of disappointing him will be to ask nothing about it
Nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said Elizabeth
cried Elizabeth
Certainly replied Elizabeth there are such people but I hope I am not one of _ them _
Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile
cried Elizabeth
He began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too much attention
