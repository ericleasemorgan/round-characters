18 It was the beginning of February and Anne having been a month in Bath was growing very eager for news from Uppercross and Lyme
She wanted to hear much more than Mary had communicated
Anne could listen no longer she could not even have told how the poor Admiral s complexion escaped her letter engrossed her
My dear Anne I make no apology for my silence because I know how little people think of letters in such a place as Bath
This was Sir Walter and Elizabeth s share of interest in the letter when Mrs Clay had paid her tribute of more decent attention in an enquiry after Mrs Charles Musgrove and her fine little boys Anne was at liberty
That was a point which Anne had not been able to avoid suspecting before and instead of drawing the same conclusion as Mary from the present course of events they served only to confirm the idea of his having felt some dawning of tenderness toward herself
No it was not regret which made Anne s heart beat in spite of herself and brought the colour into her cheeks when she thought of Captain Wentworth unshackled and free
She had some feelings which she was ashamed to investigate
She longed to see the Crofts but when the meeting took place it was evident that no rumour of the news had yet reached them
Anne saw them wherever she went
Anne was too much engaged with Lady Russell to be often walking herself but it so happened that one morning about a week or ten days after the Croft s arrival it suited her best to leave her friend or her friend s carriage in the lower part of the town and return alone to Camden Place and in walking up Milsom Street she had the good fortune to meet with the Admiral
When they were got a little farther Anne ventured to press again for what he had to communicate
She hoped when clear of Milsom Street to have her curiosity gratified but she was still obliged to wait for the Admiral had made up his mind not to begin till they had gained the greater space and quiet of Belmont and as she was not really Mrs Croft she must let him have his own way
Anne had been ashamed to appear to comprehend so soon as she really did but now she could safely suggest the name of Louisa
I thought Captain Benwick a very pleasing young man said Anne and I understand that he bears an excellent character
Anne was caught
She had only meant to oppose the too common idea of spirit and gentleness being incompatible with each other not at all to represent Captain Benwick s manners as the very best that could possibly be and after a little hesitation she was beginning to say I was not entering into any comparison of the two friends but the Admiral interrupted her with And the thing is certainly true
This was an opportunity which Anne could not resist she said therefore I hope Admiral I hope there is nothing in the style of Captain Wentworth s letter to make you and Mrs Croft particularly uneasy
Anne looked down to hide her smile
Anne did not receive the perfect conviction which the Admiral meant to convey but it would have been useless to press the enquiry farther
She therefore satisfied herself with common place remarks or quiet attention and the Admiral had it all his own way
