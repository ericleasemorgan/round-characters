45 Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley s dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at Pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that lady s side the acquaintance would now be renewed
It was first broken by Mrs Annesley a genteel agreeable looking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly well bred than either of the others and between her and Mrs Gardiner with occasional help from Elizabeth the conversation was carried on
Elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by Miss Bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to Miss Darcy without calling her attention
After sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley s voice Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family
She answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more
While thus engaged Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr Darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came
No sooner did he appear than Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room
Miss Darcy on her brother s entrance exerted herself much more to talk and Elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side
In Darcy s presence she dared not mention Wickham s name but Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moment s distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the ill natured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone
While she spoke an involuntary glance showed her Darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes
Had Miss Bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in Darcy s opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps
To no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to Elizabeth and from all Bingley s connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own
Elizabeth s collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as Miss Bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to Wickham Georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more
Her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully
Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while Mr Darcy was attending them to their carriage Miss Bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on Elizabeth s person behaviour and dress
And he had spoken in such terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable
Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected
Mrs Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both
They talked of his sister his friends his house his fruit of everything but himself yet Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs Gardiner thought of him and Mrs Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her niece s beginning the subject
