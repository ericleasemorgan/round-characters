22 The housemaid s folding back her window shutters at eight o clock the next day was the sound which first roused Catherine and she opened her eyes wondering that they could ever have been closed on objects of cheerfulness her fire was already burning and a bright morning had succeeded the tempest of the night
Instantaneously with the consciousness of existence returned her recollection of the manuscript and springing from the bed in the very moment of the maid s going away she eagerly collected every scattered sheet which had burst from the roll on its falling to the ground and flew back to enjoy the luxury of their perusal on her pillow
Catherine was saved the embarrassment of attempting an answer by the entrance of the general whose smiling compliments announced a happy state of mind but whose gentle hint of sympathetic early rising did not advance her composure
The elegance of the breakfast set forced itself on Catherine s notice when they were seated at table and luckily it had been the general s choice
He was enchanted by her approbation of his taste confessed it to be neat and simple thought it right to encourage the manufacture of his country and for his part to his uncritical palate the tea was as well flavoured from the clay of Staffordshire as from that of Dresden or SÃªve
Catherine was probably the only one of the party who did not understand him
They all attended in the hall to see him mount his horse and immediately on re entering the breakfast room Catherine walked to a window in the hope of catching another glimpse of his figure
asked Catherine
Something had been said the evening before of her being shown over the house and he now offered himself as her conductor and though Catherine had hoped to explore it accompanied only by his daughter it was a proposal of too much happiness in itself under any circumstances not to be gladly accepted for she had been already eighteen hours in the abbey and had seen only a few of its rooms
The netting box just leisurely drawn forth was closed with joyful haste and she was ready to attend him in a moment
And when they had gone over the house he promised himself moreover the pleasure of accompanying her into the shrubberies and garden
She curtsied her acquiescence
But perhaps it might be more agreeable to her to make those her first object
Which would she prefer
He was equally at her service
Which did his daughter think would most accord with her fair friend s wishes
He left the room and Catherine with a disappointed anxious face began to speak of her unwillingness that he should be taking them out of doors against his own inclination under a mistaken idea of pleasing her but she was stopped by Miss Tilney s saying with a little confusion I believe it will be wisest to take the morning while it is so fine and do not be uneasy on my father s account he always walks out at this time of day
Catherine did not exactly know how this was to be understood
Catherine had seen nothing to compare with it and her feelings of delight were so strong that without waiting for any better authority she boldly burst forth in wonder and praise
The number of acres contained in this garden was such as Catherine could not listen to without dismay being more than double the extent of all Mr Allen s as well as her father s including church yard and orchard
The general was flattered by her looks of surprise which told him almost as plainly as he soon forced her to tell him in words that she had never seen any gardens at all equal to them before and he then modestly owned that without any ambition of that sort himself without any solicitude about it he did believe them to be unrivalled in the kingdom
It was a narrow winding path through a thick grove of old Scotch firs and Catherine struck by its gloomy aspect and eager to enter it could not even by the general s disapprobation be kept from stepping forward
He perceived her inclination and having again urged the plea of health in vain was too polite to make further opposition
He turned away and Catherine was shocked to find how much her spirits were relieved by the separation
The shock however being less real than the relief offered it no injury and she began to talk with easy gaiety of the delightful melancholy which such a grove inspired
I am particularly fond of this spot said her companion with a sigh
Catherine had never heard Mrs Tilney mentioned in the family before and the interest excited by this tender remembrance showed itself directly in her altered countenance and in the attentive pause with which she waited for something more
And ought it not reflected Catherine to endear it to her husband
were questions now eagerly poured forth the first three received a ready affirmative the two others were passed by and Catherine s interest in the deceased Mrs Tilney augmented with every question whether answered or not
Catherine attempted no longer to hide from herself the nature of the feelings which in spite of all his attentions he had previously excited and what had been terror and dislike before was now absolute aversion
This second instance of his anxiety to delay what she so much wished for struck Catherine as very remarkable
