22 Anne went home to think over all that she had heard
In one point her feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot
In every other respect in looking around her or penetrating forward she saw more to distrust and to apprehend
She was concerned for the disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling for the mortifications which must be hanging over her father and sister and had all the distress of foreseeing many evils without knowing how to avert any one of them
I was really in pain for him for your hard hearted sister Miss Anne seems bent on cruelty
cried Mrs Clay not daring however to turn her eyes towards Anne
Anne admired the good acting of the friend in being able to shew such pleasure as she did in the expectation and in the actual arrival of the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her prime object
To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the room and quite painful to have him approach and speak to her
She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere but now she saw insincerity in everything
His attentive deference to her father contrasted with his former language was odious and when she thought of his cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith she could hardly bear the sight of his present smiles and mildness or the sound of his artificial good sentiments
Mrs Clay s selfishness was not so complicate nor so revolting as his and Anne would have compounded for the marriage at once with all its evils to be clear of Mr Elliot s subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it
On Friday morning she meant to go very early to Lady Russell and accomplish the necessary communication and she would have gone directly after breakfast but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some obliging purpose of saving her sister trouble which determined her to wait till she might be safe from such a companion
Anne remembering the preconcerted visits at all hours of Mr Elliot would have expected him but for his known engagement seven miles off
Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance but Anne was really glad to see them and the others were not so sorry but that they could put on a decent air of welcome and as soon as it became clear that these their nearest relations were not arrived with any views of accommodation in that house Sir Walter and Elizabeth were able to rise in cordiality and do the honours of it very well
So much was pretty soon understood but till Sir Walter and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing room and regaling themselves with her admiration Anne could not draw upon Charles s brain for a regular history of their coming or an explanation of some smiling hints of particular business which had been ostentatiously dropped by Mary as well as of some apparent confusion as to whom their party consisted of
Anne s only surprise was that affairs should be in forwardness enough for Henrietta s wedding clothes to be talked of
I am extremely glad indeed cried Anne particularly glad that this should happen and that of two sisters who both deserve equally well and who have always been such good friends the pleasant prospect of one should not be dimming those of the other that they should be so equal in their prosperity and comfort
Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove exclaimed Anne should be happy in their children s marriages
Anne could not help laughing
That can not be much to your taste I know said she but I do believe him to be an excellent young man
Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles s following the others to admire mirrors and china but Anne had heard enough to understand the present state of Uppercross and rejoice in its happiness and though she sighed as she rejoiced her sigh had none of the ill will of envy in it
She would certainly have risen to their blessings if she could but she did not want to lessen theirs
Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the course of the morning and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary to go and see her and Henrietta directly
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes but Anne convinced herself that a day s delay of the intended communication could be of no consequence and hastened forward to the White Hart to see again the friends and companions of the last autumn with an eagerness of good will which many associations contributed to form
They found Mrs Musgrove and her daughter within and by themselves and Anne had the kindest welcome from each
It was a heartiness and a warmth and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more from the sad want of such blessings at home
She was entreated to give them as much of her time as possible invited for every day and all day long or rather claimed as part of the family and in return she naturally fell into all her wonted ways of attention and assistance and on Charles s leaving them together was listening to Mrs Musgrove s history of Louisa and to Henrietta s of herself giving opinions on business and recommendations to shops with intervals of every help which Mary required from altering her ribbon to settling her accounts from finding her keys and assorting her trinkets to trying to convince her that she was not ill used by anybody which Mary well amused as she generally was in her station at a window overlooking the entrance to the Pump Room could not but have her moments of imagining
One five minutes brought a note the next a parcel and Anne had not been there half an hour when their dining room spacious as it was seemed more than half filled a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth
Anne cried Mary still at her window there is Mrs Clay I am sure standing under the colonnade and a gentleman with her
No cried Anne quickly it can not be Mr Elliot I assure you
As she spoke she felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her the consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her and made her regret that she had said so much simple as it was
Mary resenting that she should be supposed not to know her own cousin began talking very warmly about the family features and protesting still more positively that it was Mr Elliot calling again upon Anne to come and look for herself but Anne did not mean to stir and tried to be cool and unconcerned
Her distress returned however on perceiving smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady visitors as if they believed themselves quite in the secret
Do come Anne cried Mary come and look yourself
To pacify Mary and perhaps screen her own embarrassment Anne did move quietly to the window
She was just in time to ascertain that it really was Mr Elliot which she had never believed before he disappeared on one side as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other and checking the surprise which she could not but feel at such an appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally opposite interest she calmly said Yes it is Mr Elliot certainly
Anne will not be sorry to join us I am sure
The careless expression was life to Anne who saw that Captain Wentworth was all attention looking and listening with his whole soul and that the last words brought his enquiring eyes from Charles to herself
It would be a pity to be divided and we should be losing Miss Anne too if there is a party at her father s and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play if Miss Anne could not be with us
Anne felt truly obliged to her for such kindness and quite as much so for the opportunity it gave her of decidedly saying If it depended only on my inclination ma am the party at home excepting on Mary s account would not be the smallest impediment
Captain Wentworth left his seat and walked to the fire place probably for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards and taking a station with less bare faced design by Anne
I am not yet so much changed cried Anne and stopped fearing she hardly knew what misconstruction
Whether he would have proceeded farther was left to Anne s imagination to ponder over in a calmer hour for while still hearing the sounds he had uttered she was startled to other subjects by Henrietta eager to make use of the present leisure for getting out and calling on her companions to lose no time lest somebody else should come in
Anne talked of being perfectly ready and tried to look it but she felt that could Henrietta have known the regret and reluctance of her heart in quitting that chair in preparing to quit the room she would have found in all her own sensations for her cousin in the very security of his affection wherewith to pity her
Anne felt an instant oppression and wherever she looked saw symptoms of the same
The comfort the freedom the gaiety of the room was over hushed into cold composure determined silence or insipid talk to meet the heartless elegance of her father and sister
Her jealous eye was satisfied in one particular
The interruption had been short though severe and ease and animation returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out but not to Anne
She could think only of the invitation she had with such astonishment witnessed and of the manner in which it had been received a manner of doubtful meaning of surprise rather than gratification of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance
She knew him she saw disdain in his eye and could not venture to believe that he had determined to accept such an offering as an atonement for all the insolence of the past
Her spirits sank
Anne caught his eye saw his cheeks glow and his mouth form itself into a momentary expression of contempt and turned away that she might neither see nor hear more to vex her
The gentlemen had their own pursuits the ladies proceeded on their own business and they met no more while Anne belonged to them
She was earnestly begged to return and dine and give them all the rest of the day but her spirits had been so long exerted that at present she felt unequal to more and fit only for home where she might be sure of being as silent as she chose
Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning therefore she closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to Camden Place there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow s party the frequent enumeration of the persons invited and the continually improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the most completely elegant of its kind in Bath while harassing herself with the never ending question of whether Captain Wentworth would come or not
It was transient cleared away in an instant but Anne could imagine she read there the consciousness of having by some complication of mutual trick or some overbearing authority of his been obliged to attend perhaps for half an hour to his lectures and restrictions on her designs on Sir Walter
She exclaimed however with a very tolerable imitation of nature Oh
