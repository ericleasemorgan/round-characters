IX Mr Knightley might quarrel with her but Emma could not quarrel with herself
Emma was soon perfectly satisfied of Mr Martin s being no otherwise remembered than as he furnished a contrast with Mr Elton of the utmost advantage to the latter
Her views of improving her little friend s mind by a great deal of useful reading and conversation had never yet led to more than a few first chapters and the intention of going on to morrow
It was much easier to chat than to study much pleasanter to let her imagination range and work at Harriet s fortune than to be labouring to enlarge her comprehension or exercise it on sober facts and the only literary pursuit which engaged Harriet at present the only mental provision she was making for the evening of life was the collecting and transcribing all the riddles of every sort that she could meet with into a thin quarto of hot pressed paper made up by her friend and ornamented with ciphers and trophies
Emma assisted with her invention memory and taste and as Harriet wrote a very pretty hand it was likely to be an arrangement of the first order in form as well as quantity
He called for a few moments just to leave a piece of paper on the table containing as he said a charade which a friend of his had addressed to a young lady the object of his admiration but which from his manner Emma was immediately convinced must be his own
The speech was more to Emma than to Harriet which Emma could understand
There was deep consciousness about him and he found it easier to meet her eye than her friend s
He was gone the next moment after another moment s pause Take it said Emma smiling and pushing the paper towards Harriet it is for you
But Harriet was in a tremor and could not touch it and Emma never loth to be first was obliged to examine it herself
Emma spoke for her
There is so pointed and so particular a meaning in this compliment said she that I can not have a doubt as to Mr Elton s intentions
Emma could not have desired a more spirited rejection of Mr Martin s prose
Very well replied Emma a most natural feeling and the longer it lasts the better I shall be pleased
Nobody could have written so prettily but you Emma
Emma only nodded and smiled
I think Emma I shall try and persuade her to stay longer with us
She and the children might stay very well
Unwelcome as it was Mr Woodhouse could only give a submissive sigh and as Emma saw his spirits affected by the idea of his daughter s attachment to her husband she immediately led to such a branch of the subject as must raise them
He appears rough to you said Emma because you are so very gentle yourself but if you could compare him with other papas you would not think him rough
Harriet turned away but Emma could receive him with the usual smile and her quick eye soon discerned in his the consciousness of having made a push of having thrown a die and she imagined he was come to see how it might turn up
Emma thanked him but could not allow of his disappointing his friend on their account her father was sure of his rubber
He re urged she re declined and he seemed then about to make his bow when taking the paper from the table she returned it Oh
He looked rather doubtingly rather confused said something about honour glanced at Emma and at Harriet and then seeing the book open on the table took it up and examined it very attentively
With the view of passing off an awkward moment Emma smilingly said You must make my apologies to your friend but so good a charade must not be confined to one or two
Emma could not think it too soon for with all his good and agreeable qualities there was a sort of parade in his speeches which was very apt to incline her to laugh
She ran away to indulge the inclination leaving the tender and the sublime of pleasure to Harriet s share
