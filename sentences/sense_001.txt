Elinor this eldest daughter whose advice was so effectual possessed a strength of understanding and coolness of judgment which qualified her though only nineteen to be the counsellor of her mother and enabled her frequently to counteract to the advantage of them all that eagerness of mind in Mrs Dashwood which must generally have led to imprudence
Marianne s abilities were in many respects quite equal to Elinor s
She was sensible and clever but eager in everything her sorrows her joys could have no moderation
She was generous amiable interesting she was everything but prudent
The resemblance between her and her mother was strikingly great
Elinor saw with concern the excess of her sister s sensibility but by Mrs Dashwood it was valued and cherished
Elinor too was deeply afflicted but still she could struggle she could exert herself
She could consult with her brother could receive her sister in law on her arrival and treat her with proper attention and could strive to rouse her mother to similar exertion and encourage her to similar forbearance
