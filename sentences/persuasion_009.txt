Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet quite doubtful as far as Anne s observation reached
There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark about them in the Mansion house but it was different at the Cottage the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder and Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss Musgroves company and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared when Anne had to listen to the opinions of her brother and sister as to which was the one liked best
Charles may say what he pleases cried Mary to Anne as soon as he was out of the room but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry Charles Hayter a very bad thing for her and still worse for me and therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon put him quite out of her head and I have very little doubt that he has
A dinner at Mr Musgrove s had been the occasion when all these things should have been seen by Anne but she had staid at home under the mixed plea of a headache of her own and some return of indisposition in little Charles

She hoped on turning her head to see the master of the house but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters easy Charles Hayter probably not at all better pleased by the sight of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of Anne
She only attempted to say How do you do
