19 A few days passed away and Catherine though not allowing herself to suspect her friend could not help watching her closely
The result of her observations was not agreeable
A something of languid indifference or of that boasted absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before would occasionally come across her but had nothing worse appeared _ that _ might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest
But when Catherine saw her in public admitting Captain Tilney s attentions as readily as they were offered and allowing him almost an equal share with James in her notice and smiles the alteration became too positive to be passed over
What could be meant by such unsteady conduct what her friend could be at was beyond her comprehension
Isabella could not be aware of the pain she was inflicting but it was a degree of wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent
She saw him grave and uneasy and however careless of his present comfort the woman might be who had given him her heart to _ her _ it was always an object
When Catherine knew this her resolution was directly made
She spoke to Henry Tilney on the subject regretting his brother s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe and entreating him to make known her prior engagement
No he does not know what he is about cried Catherine he does not know the pain he is giving my brother
Catherine blushed for her friend and said Isabella is wrong
After a short pause Catherine resumed with Then you do not believe Isabella so very much attached to my brother
Well said Catherine after some moments consideration _ you _ may be able to guess at your brother s intentions from all this but I am sure I can not
Catherine would contend no longer against comfort
She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech but it now carried her captive
She blamed herself for the extent of her fears and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again
Her resolution was supported by Isabella s behaviour in their parting interview
The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine s stay in Pulteney Street and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her uneasiness or make her quit them in apprehension
Her tenderness for her friend seemed rather the first feeling of her heart but that at such a moment was allowable and once she gave her lover a flat contradiction and once she drew back her hand but Catherine remembered Henry s instructions and placed it all to judicious affection
