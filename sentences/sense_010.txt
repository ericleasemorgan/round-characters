Well Marianne said Elinor as soon as he had left them for _ one _ morning I think you have done pretty well
Elinor cried Marianne is this fair
My love said her mother you must not be offended with Elinor she was only in jest
I should scold her myself if she were capable of wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend
In Mrs Dashwood s estimation he was as faultless as in Marianne s and Elinor saw nothing to censure in him but a propensity in which he strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her sister of saying too much what he thought on every occasion without attention to persons or circumstances
In hastily forming and giving his opinion of other people in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided attention where his heart was engaged and in slighting too easily the forms of worldly propriety he displayed a want of caution which Elinor could not approve in spite of all that he and Marianne could say in its support
Colonel Brandon s partiality for Marianne which had so early been discovered by his friends now first became perceptible to Elinor when it ceased to be noticed by them
Elinor was obliged though unwillingly to believe that the sentiments which Mrs Jennings had assigned him for her own satisfaction were now actually excited by her sister and that however a general resemblance of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr Willoughby an equally striking opposition of character was no hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon
Do not boast of it however said Elinor for it is injustice in both of you
You decide on his imperfections so much in the mass replied Elinor and so much on the strength of your own imagination that the commendation _ I _ am able to give of him is comparatively cold and insipid
