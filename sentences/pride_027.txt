March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford
She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but Charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty
His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh and trusting their opinion of her their opinion of everybody would always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing
Her fellow travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable
Elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known Sir William s too long
He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information
As they drove to Mr Gardiner s door Jane was at a drawing room window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and Elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever
On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousin s appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing room and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower
Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt
Their first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection
But my dear Elizabeth she added what sort of girl is Miss King
Well cried Elizabeth have it as you choose
_ He _ shall be mercenary and _ she _ shall be foolish
No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful
