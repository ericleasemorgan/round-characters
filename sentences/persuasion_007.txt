But a week must pass only a week in Anne s reckoning and then she supposed they must meet and soon she began to wish that she could feel secure even for a week
Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove s civility and she was all but calling there in the same half hour
She and Mary were actually setting forward for the Great House where as she afterwards learnt they must inevitably have found him when they were stopped by the eldest boy s being at that moment brought home in consequence of a bad fall
The child s situation put the visit entirely aside but she could not hear of her escape with indifference even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on his account
It was an afternoon of distress and Anne had every thing to do at once the apothecary to send for the father to have pursued and informed the mother to support and keep from hysterics the servants to control the youngest child to banish and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe besides sending as soon as she recollected it proper notice to the other house which brought her an accession rather of frightened enquiring companions than of very useful assistants
Oh no as to leaving the little boy both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm to bear the thought and Anne in the joy of the escape could not help adding her warm protestations to theirs
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter
She said nothing therefore till he was out of the room but as soon as there was only Anne to hear So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves with this poor sick child and not a creature coming near us all the evening
An excellent thought of yours indeed Anne
The next moment she was tapping at her husband s dressing room door and as Anne followed her up stairs she was in time for the whole conversation which began with Mary s saying in a tone of great exultation I mean to go with you Charles for I am of no more use at home than you are
Anne will stay Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him
It is Anne s own proposal and so I shall go with you which will be a great deal better for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday
This is very kind of Anne was her husband s answer and I should be very glad to have you go but it seems rather hard that she should be left at home by herself to nurse our sick child
Anne was now at hand to take up her own cause and the sincerity of her manner being soon sufficient to convince him where conviction was at least very agreeable he had no farther scruples as to her being left to dine alone though he still wanted her to join them in the evening when the child might be at rest for the night and kindly urged her to let him come and fetch her but she was quite unpersuadable and this being the case she had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off together in high spirits
They were gone she hoped to be happy however oddly constructed such happiness might seem as for herself she was left with as many sensations of comfort as were perhaps ever likely to be hers
She knew herself to be of the first utility to the child and what was it to her if Frederick Wentworth were only half a mile distant making himself agreeable to others
She would have liked to know how he felt as to a meeting
Had he wished ever to see her again he need not have waited till this time he would have done what she could not but believe that in his place she should have done long ago when events had been early giving him the independence which alone had been wanting
Her brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance and their visit in general
Anne understood it
He wished to avoid seeing her
He had inquired after her she found slightly as might suit a former slight acquaintance seeming to acknowledge such as she had acknowledged actuated perhaps by the same view of escaping introduction when they were to meet
The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the other house and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to say that they were just setting off that he was come for his dogs that his sisters were following with Captain Wentworth his sisters meaning to visit Mary and the child and Captain Wentworth proposing also to wait on her for a few minutes if not inconvenient and though Charles had answered for the child s being in no such state as could make it inconvenient Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without his running on to give notice
Mary very much gratified by this attention was delighted to receive him while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne of which this was the most consoling that it would soon be over
Her eye half met Captain Wentworth s a bow a curtsey passed she heard his voice he talked to Mary said all that was right said something to the Miss Musgroves enough to mark an easy footing the room seemed full full of persons and voices but a few minutes ended it
Charles shewed himself at the window all was ready their visitor had bowed and was gone the Miss Musgroves were gone too suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the sportsmen the room was cleared and Anne might finish her breakfast as she could
she repeated to herself again and again in nervous gratitude
On one other question which perhaps her utmost wisdom might not have prevented she was soon spared all suspense for after the Miss Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she had this spontaneous information from Mary Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you Anne though he was so attentive to me
Anne fully submitted in silent deep mortification
Doubtless it was so and she could take no revenge for he was not altered or not for the worse
She had already acknowledged it to herself and she could not think differently let him think of her as he would
No the years which had destroyed her youth and bloom had only given him a more glowing manly open look in no respect lessening his personal advantages
She had seen the same Frederick Wentworth
So altered that he should not have known her again
These were words which could not but dwell with her
Yet she soon began to rejoice that she had heard them
They were of sobering tendency they allayed agitation they composed and consequently must make her happier
Frederick Wentworth had used such words or something like them but without an idea that they would be carried round to her
He had thought her wretchedly altered and in the first moment of appeal had spoken as he felt
He had not forgiven Anne Elliot
She had used him ill deserted and disappointed him and worse she had shewn a feebleness of character in doing so which his own decided confident temper could not endure
She had given him up to oblige others
He had been most warmly attached to her and had never seen a woman since whom he thought her equal but except from some natural sensation of curiosity he had no desire of meeting her again
Her power with him was gone for ever
He had a heart for either of the Miss Musgroves if they could catch it a heart in short for any pleasing young woman who came in his way excepting Anne Elliot
His bright proud eye spoke the conviction that he was nice and Anne Elliot was not out of his thoughts when he more seriously described the woman he should wish to meet with
