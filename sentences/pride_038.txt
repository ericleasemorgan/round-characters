38 On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr Collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary
I know not Miss Elizabeth said he whether Mrs Collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but I am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it
Elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness
She had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with Charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make _ her _ feel the obliged
Words were insufficient for the elevation of his feelings and he was obliged to walk about the room while Elizabeth tried to unite civility and truth in a few short sentences
Only let me assure you my dear Miss Elizabeth that I can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage
Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts
She was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang
After an affectionate parting between the friends Elizabeth was attended to the carriage by Mr Collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at Longbourn in the winter and his compliments to Mr and Mrs Gardiner though unknown
Elizabeth made no objection the door was then allowed to be shut and the carriage drove off
Elizabeth added privately And how much I shall have to conceal
Jane looked well and Elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them
