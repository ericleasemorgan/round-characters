Catherine s spirits revived as they drove from the door for with Miss Tilney she felt no restraint and with the interest of a road entirely new to her of an abbey before and a curricle behind she caught the last view of Bath without any regret and met with every milestone before she expected it
Had their party been perfectly agreeable the delay would have been nothing but General Tilney though so charming a man seemed always a check upon his children s spirits and scarcely anything was said but by himself the observation of which with his discontent at whatever the inn afforded and his angry impatience at the waiters made Catherine grow every moment more in awe of him and appeared to lengthen the two hours into four
At last however the order of release was given and much was Catherine then surprised by the general s proposal of her taking his place in his son s curricle for the rest of the journey the day was fine and he was anxious for her seeing as much of the country as possible
The remembrance of Mr Allen s opinion respecting young men s open carriages made her blush at the mention of such a plan and her first thought was to decline it but her second was of greater deference for General Tilney s judgment he could not propose anything improper for her and in the course of a few minutes she found herself with Henry in the curricle as happy a being as ever existed
said Catherine
Are not you with her
Catherine recollecting herself grew ashamed of her eagerness and began earnestly to assure him that her attention had been fixed without the smallest apprehension of really meeting with what he related
This seemed the word of separation and Catherine found herself hurried away by Miss Tilney in such a manner as convinced her that the strictest punctuality to the family hours would be expected at Northanger
On one side it had a range of doors and it was lighted on the other by windows which Catherine had only time to discover looked into a quadrangle before Miss Tilney led the way into a chamber and scarcely staying to hope she would find it comfortable left her with an anxious entreaty that she would make as little alteration as possible in her dress
