17 The Allens had now entered on the sixth week of their stay in Bath and whether it should be the last was for some time a question to which Catherine listened with a beating heart
To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance
Her whole happiness seemed at stake while the affair was in suspense and everything secured when it was determined that the lodgings should be taken for another fortnight
What this additional fortnight was to produce to her beyond the pleasure of sometimes seeing Henry Tilney made but a small part of Catherine s speculation
Once or twice indeed since James s engagement had taught her what _ could _ be done she had got so far as to indulge in a secret perhaps but in general the felicity of being with him for the present bounded her views the present was now comprised in another three weeks and her happiness being certain for that period the rest of her life was at such a distance as to excite but little interest
In the course of the morning which saw this business arranged she visited Miss Tilney and poured forth her joyful feelings
No sooner had she expressed her delight in Mr Allen s lengthened stay than Miss Tilney told her of her father s having just determined upon quitting Bath by the end of another week
Catherine s countenance fell and in a voice of most sincere concern she echoed Miss Tilney s concluding words By the end of another week
I am very sorry for it said Catherine dejectedly if I had known this before Perhaps said Miss Tilney in an embarrassed manner you would be so good it would make me very happy if The entrance of her father put a stop to the civility which Catherine was beginning to hope might introduce a desire of their corresponding
After addressing her with his usual politeness he turned to his daughter and said Well Eleanor may I congratulate you on being successful in your application to your fair friend
These were thrilling words and wound up Catherine s feelings to the highest point of ecstasy
Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness
To have her company so warmly solicited
Everything honourable and soothing every present enjoyment and every future hope was contained in it and her acceptance with only the saving clause of Papa and Mamma s approbation was eagerly given
I will write home directly said she and if they do not object as I dare say they will not General Tilney was not less sanguine having already waited on her excellent friends in Pulteney Street and obtained their sanction of his wishes
The circumstances of the morning had led Catherine s feelings through the varieties of suspense security and disappointment but they were now safely lodged in perfect bliss and with spirits elated to rapture with Henry at her heart and Northanger Abbey on her lips she hurried home to write her letter
This indulgence though not more than Catherine had hoped for completed her conviction of being favoured beyond every other human creature in friends and fortune circumstance and chance
Everything seemed to cooperate for her advantage
By the kindness of her first friends the Allens she had been introduced into scenes where pleasures of every kind had met her
Her feelings her preferences had each known the happiness of a return
Wherever she felt attachment she had been able to create it
