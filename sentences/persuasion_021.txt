21 Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her promise of going to Mrs Smith meaning that it should engage her from home at the time when Mr Elliot would be most likely to call for to avoid Mr Elliot was almost a first object
She felt a great deal of good will towards him
In spite of the mischief of his attentions she owed him gratitude and regard perhaps compassion
She could not help thinking much of the extraordinary circumstances attending their acquaintance of the right which he seemed to have to interest her by everything in situation by his own sentiments by his early prepossession
How she might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case was not worth enquiry for there was a Captain Wentworth and be the conclusion of the present suspense good or bad her affection would be his for ever
Their union she believed could not divide her more from other men than their final separation
Prettier musings of high wrought love and eternal constancy could never have passed along the streets of Bath than Anne was sporting with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings
She was sure of a pleasant reception and her friend seemed this morning particularly obliged to her for coming seemed hardly to have expected her though it had been an appointment
An account of the concert was immediately claimed and Anne s recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her features and make her rejoice to talk of it
All that she could tell she told most gladly but the all was little for one who had been there and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith who had already heard through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne could relate and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the company
But I ought to have looked about me more said Anne conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about that the object only had been deficient
Anne half smiled and said Do you see that in my eye
A blush overspread Anne s cheeks
She could say nothing
Anne heard nothing of this
She was still in the astonishment and confusion excited by her friend s penetration unable to imagine how any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her
repeated Anne looking up surprised
A moment s reflection shewed her the mistake she had been under
She caught it instantaneously and recovering her courage with the feeling of safety soon added more composedly Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot
I should be extremely happy I hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied Anne but I suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case
No replied Anne nor next week nor next nor next
No said Anne I can readily believe all that of my cousin
As it was she instantly submitted and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond and Anne eager to escape farther notice was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have fancied she was to marry Mr Elliot where she could have received the idea or from whom she could have heard it
The whole history repeated Anne laughing
She could not make a very long history I think of one such little article of unfounded news
But continued Anne presently though there is no truth in my having this claim on Mr Elliot I should be extremely happy to be of use to you in any way that I could
I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years was Mrs Smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and Anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity
Anne s astonished air and exclamation of wonder made her pause and in a calmer manner she added My expressions startle you
This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot s life said Anne which has always excited my particular curiosity
Nay said Anne I have no particular enquiry to make about her
Perhaps cried Anne struck by a sudden idea you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot
This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night cried Anne
Indeed my dear Mrs Smith I want none cried Anne
Anne seeing her friend to be earnestly bent on it did as she was desired
The box was brought and placed before her and Mrs Smith sighing over it as she unlocked it said This is full of papers belonging to him to my husband a small portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him
Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow and Mrs Smith observing the high colour in her face said The language I know is highly disrespectful
Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father
She was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say Thank you
Here Mrs Smith paused a moment but Anne had not a word to say and she continued This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and Colonel Wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in Camden Place but his regard for Mr Elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when Mr Elliot came to Bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before Christmas Colonel Wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail
Yes said Anne you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known or could imagine
I am very glad to know all this said Anne after a little thoughtfulness
Mrs Smith had been carried away from her first direction and Anne had forgotten in the interest of her own family concerns how much had been originally implied against him but her attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints and she listened to a recital which if it did not perfectly justify the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith proved him to have been very unfeeling in his conduct towards her very deficient both in justice and compassion
Mrs Smith did not want to take blame to herself and was most tender of throwing any on her husband but Anne could collect that their income had never been equal to their style of living and that from the first there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance
Anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from Mrs Smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her
It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and inhumanity and Anne felt at some moments that no flagrant open crime could have been worse
She had a great deal to listen to all the particulars of past sad scenes all the minutiae of distress upon distress which in former conversations had been merely hinted at were dwelt on now with a natural indulgence
Anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s usual state of mind
There was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation
She had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the West Indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich
Mr Elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money
She had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law
To feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear
It was on this point that she had hoped to engage Anne s good offices with Mr Elliot
She had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in Bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest Anne s feelings as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot s character would allow when Anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way
After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot Anne could not but express some surprise at Mrs Smith s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation
She had seemed to recommend and praise him
Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed
It was just possible that she might have been persuaded by Lady Russell
It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that Anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to Mrs Smith in which his conduct was involved
