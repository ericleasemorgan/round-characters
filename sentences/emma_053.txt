XVII Mrs Weston s friends were all made happy by her safety and if the satisfaction of her well doing could be increased to Emma it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl
cried Emma at that rate what will become of her
She will be disagreeable in infancy and correct herself as she grows older
I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children my dearest Emma
Emma laughed and replied But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people
I am sure you were of use to me cried Emma
Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith but it was too tender a subject
She could not enter on it
This on his side might merely proceed from her not being thought of but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy and a suspicion from some appearances that their friendship were declining
She was aware herself that parting under any other circumstances they certainly should have corresponded more and that her intelligence would not have rested as it now almost wholly did on Isabella s letters
Emma s comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on by Harriet s being to stay longer her fortnight was likely to be a month at least
Emma accepted it with a very eager hand with an impatience all alive to know what he would say about it and not at all checked by hearing that her friend was unmentioned
He writes like a sensible man replied Emma when she had read the letter
My Emma he means no such thing
He only means He and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two interrupted she with a sort of serious smile much less perhaps than he is aware of if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject
Emma my dear Emma Oh
she cried with more thorough gaiety if you fancy your brother does not do me justice only wait till my dear father is in the secret and hear his opinion
I wish I may not sink into poor Emma with him at once
As soon as Mrs Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr Woodhouse s visits Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause resolved first to announce it at home and then at Randalls
But how to break it to her father at last
She had bound herself to do it in such an hour of Mr Knightley s absence or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her and she must have put it off but Mr Knightley was to come at such a time and follow up the beginning she was to make
She was forced to speak and to speak cheerfully too
She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him by a melancholy tone herself
She must not appear to think it a misfortune
With all the spirits she could command she prepared him first for something strange and then in a few words said that if his consent and approbation could be obtained which she trusted would be attended with no difficulty since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all she and Mr Knightley meant to marry by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person s company whom she knew he loved next to his daughters and Mrs Weston best in the world
Emma hung about him affectionately and smiled and said it must be so and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs Weston whose marriages taking them from Hartfield had indeed made a melancholy change but she was not going from Hartfield she should be always there she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr Knightley always at hand when he were once got used to the idea
To Emma s entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr Knightley s whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome and he was soon used to be talked to by each on every fair occasion
She had been extremely surprized never more so than when Emma first opened the affair to her but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost
She had such a regard for Mr Knightley as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma and it was in every respect so proper suitable and unexceptionable a connexion and in one respect one point of the highest importance so peculiarly eligible so singularly fortunate that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it and wished it long ago
How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield
The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband s plans and her own for a marriage between Frank and Emma
