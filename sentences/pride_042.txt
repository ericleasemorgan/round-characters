42 Had Elizabeth s opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort
Her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her
Elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her father s behaviour as a husband
She had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible
When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham s departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment
Their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though Kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a watering place and a camp
Mrs Bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of June Kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the following Christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the War Office another regiment should be quartered in Meryton
Elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the Lakes and still thought there might have been time enough
But it was her business to be satisfied and certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again
It was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of Pemberley and its owner
But surely said she I may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me
Four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunt s arrival
The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn and set off the next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement
To the little town of Lambton the scene of Mrs Gardiner s former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of Lambton Elizabeth found from her aunt that Pemberley was situated
Mr Gardiner declared his willingness and Elizabeth was applied to for her approbation
said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected
Elizabeth was distressed
She felt that she had no business at Pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it
She must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains
Elizabeth said no more but her mind could not acquiesce
She blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk
But against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered
Accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether Pemberley were not a very fine place
A most welcome negative followed the last question and her alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme
