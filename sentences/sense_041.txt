So far was she at the same time from any backwardness to give Elinor that credit which Edward _ would _ give her that she spoke of her friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth was ready to own all their obligation to her and openly declared that no exertion for their good on Miss Dashwood s part either present or future would ever surprise her for she believed her capable of doing any thing in the world for those she really valued
It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley Street and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his wife s indisposition beyond one verbal enquiry Elinor began to feel it necessary to pay her a visit
This was an obligation however which not only opposed her own inclination but which had not the assistance of any encouragement from her companions
Marianne not contented with absolutely refusing to go herself was very urgent to prevent her sister s going at all and Mrs Jennings though her carriage was always at Elinor s service so very much disliked Mrs John Dashwood that not even her curiosity to see how she looked after the late discovery nor her strong desire to affront her by taking Edward s part could overcome her unwillingness to be in her company again
The consequence was that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit for which no one could really have less inclination and to run the risk of a tête à tête with a woman whom neither of the others had so much reason to dislike
He expressed great pleasure in meeting Elinor told her that he had been just going to call in Berkeley Street and assuring her that Fanny would be very glad to see her invited her to come in
Elinor made what excuse she could for her
Elinor contradicted it however very positively and by relating that she had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel Brandon to Edward and therefore must understand the terms on which it was given obliged him to submit to her authority
he cried after hearing what she said what could be the Colonel s motive
Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing that she thought Fanny might have borne with composure an acquisition of wealth to her brother by which neither she nor her child could be possibly impoverished
Elinor said John your reasoning is very good but it is founded on ignorance of human nature
Elinor was silent
Elinor smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her brother s tone calmly replied The lady I suppose has no choice in the affair
Elinor said no more and John was also for a short time silent
Not that you have any reason to regret my dear Elinor
Elinor had heard enough if not to gratify her vanity and raise her self importance to agitate her nerves and fill her mind and she was therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply herself and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her brother by the entrance of Mr Robert Ferrars
After a few moments chat John Dashwood recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her sister s being there quitted the room in quest of her and Elinor was left to improve her acquaintance with Robert who by the gay unconcern the happy self complacency of his manner while enjoying so unfair a division of his mother s love and liberality to the prejudice of his banished brother earned only by his own dissipated course of life and that brother s integrity was confirming her most unfavourable opinion of his head and heart
Elinor repeated the particulars of it as she had given them to John and their effect on Robert though very different was not less striking than it had been on _ him _
Elinor while she waited in silence and immovable gravity the conclusion of such folly could not restrain her eyes from being fixed on him with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited
It was a look however very well bestowed for it relieved her own feelings and gave no intelligence to him
But though _ she _ never spoke of it out of her own family Elinor could see its influence on her mind in the something like confusion of countenance with which she entered and an attempt at cordiality in her behaviour to herself
She even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her sister were so soon to leave town as she had hoped to see more of them an exertion in which her husband who attended her into the room and hung enamoured over her accents seemed to distinguish every thing that was most affectionate and graceful
