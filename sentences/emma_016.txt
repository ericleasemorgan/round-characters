XVI The hair was curled and the maid sent away and Emma sat down to think and be miserable
Such an overthrow of every thing she had been wishing for
But he had fancied her in love with him that evidently must have been his dependence and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her own behaviour to him had been so complaisant and obliging so full of courtesy and attention as supposing her real motive unperceived might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy like Mr Elton in fancying himself a very decided favourite
If she had so misinterpreted his feelings she had little right to wonder that he with self interest to blind him should have mistaken hers
The first error and the worst lay at her door
She was quite concerned and ashamed and resolved to do such things no more
Here have I said she actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man
She might never have thought of him but for me and certainly never would have thought of him with hope if I had not assured her of his attachment for she is as modest and humble as I used to think him
that I had been satisfied with persuading her not to accept young Martin
I was introducing her into good company and giving her the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having I ought not to have attempted more
To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma s though under temporary gloom at night the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits
Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she had gone to bed more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her and to depend on getting tolerably out of it
It was a great consolation that Mr Elton should not be really in love with her or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him that Harriet s nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any body s knowing what had passed except the three principals and especially for her father s being given a moment s uneasiness about it
But with all the hopes of cheerfulness and all the present comfort of delay there was still such an evil hanging over her in the hour of explanation with Harriet as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease
