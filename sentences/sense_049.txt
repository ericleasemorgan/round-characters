It was only to ask Elinor to marry him and considering that he was not altogether inexperienced in such a question it might be strange that he should feel so uncomfortable in the present case as he really did so much in need of encouragement and fresh air
His heart was now open to Elinor all its weaknesses all its errors confessed and his first boyish attachment to Lucy treated with all the philosophic dignity of twenty four
Mrs Dashwood too happy to be comfortable knew not how to love Edward nor praise Elinor enough how to be enough thankful for his release without wounding his delicacy nor how at once to give them leisure for unrestrained conversation together and yet enjoy as she wished the sight and society of both
But Elinor how are _ her _ feelings to be described
Edward was now fixed at the cottage at least for a week for whatever other claims might be made on him it was impossible that less than a week should be given up to the enjoyment of Elinor s company or suffice to say half that was to be said of the past the present and the future for though a very few hours spent in the hard labor of incessant talking will despatch more subjects than can really be in common between any two rational creatures yet with lovers it is different
Lucy s marriage the unceasing and reasonable wonder among them all formed of course one of the earliest discussions of the lovers and Elinor s particular knowledge of each party made it appear to her in every view as one of the most extraordinary and unaccountable circumstances she had ever heard
Elinor remembered what Robert had told her in Harley Street of his opinion of what his own mediation in his brother s affairs might have done if applied to in time
She repeated it to Edward
He put the letter into Elinor s hands
Elinor read and returned it without any comment
However it may have come about said Elinor after a pause they are certainly married
That Lucy had certainly meant to deceive to go off with a flourish of malice against him in her message by Thomas was perfectly clear to Elinor and Edward himself now thoroughly enlightened on her character had no scruple in believing her capable of the utmost meanness of wanton ill nature
Though his eyes had been long opened even before his acquaintance with Elinor began to her ignorance and a want of liberality in some of her opinions they had been equally imputed by him to her want of education and till her last letter reached him he had always believed her to be a well disposed good hearted girl and thoroughly attached to himself
Elinor scolded him harshly as ladies always scold the imprudence which compliments themselves for having spent so much time with them at Norland when he must have felt his own inconstancy
Your behaviour was certainly very wrong said she because to say nothing of my own conviction our relations were all led away by it to fancy and expect _ what _ as you were _ then _ situated could never be
Elinor smiled and shook her head
But so little interest had he taken in the matter that he owed all his knowledge of the house garden and glebe extent of the parish condition of the land and rate of the tithes to Elinor herself who had heard so much of it from Colonel Brandon and heard it with so much attention as to be entirely mistress of the subject
Edward had two thousand pounds and Elinor one which with Delaford living was all that they could call their own for it was impossible that Mrs Dashwood should advance anything and they were neither of them quite enough in love to think that three hundred and fifty pounds a year would supply them with the comforts of life
But Elinor had no such dependence for since Edward would still be unable to marry Miss Morton and his chusing herself had been spoken of in Mrs Ferrars s flattering language as only a lesser evil than his chusing Lucy Steele she feared that Robert s offence would serve no other purpose than to enrich Fanny
Every thing was explained to him by Mrs Dashwood and he found fresh reason to rejoice in what he had done for Mr Ferrars since eventually it promoted the interest of Elinor
The letters from town which a few days before would have made every nerve in Elinor s body thrill with transport now arrived to be read with less emotion than mirth
The secrecy with which everything had been carried on between them was rationally treated as enormously heightening the crime because had any suspicion of it occurred to the others proper measures would have been taken to prevent the marriage and he called on Elinor to join with him in regretting that Lucy s engagement with Edward had not rather been fulfilled than that she should thus be the means of spreading misery farther in the family
You may certainly ask to be forgiven said Elinor because you have offended and I should think you might _ now _ venture so far as to profess some concern for having ever formed the engagement which drew on you your mother s anger
