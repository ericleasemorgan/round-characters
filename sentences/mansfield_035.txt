I am come to walk with you Fanny said he
Drawing her arm within his
She assented to it all rather by look than word
Her spirits were low
As far as you have gone Fanny I think you perfectly right
But with an affectionate smile let him succeed at last Fanny let him succeed at last
We are so totally unlike said Fanny avoiding a direct answer we are so very very different in all our inclinations and ways that I consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy together even if I _ could _ like him
You have both warm hearts and benevolent feelings and Fanny who that heard him read and saw you listen to Shakespeare the other night will think you unfitted as companions
After leaving him to his happier thoughts for some minutes Fanny feeling it due to herself returned to Mr Crawford and said It is not merely in _ temper _ that I consider him as totally unsuited to myself though in _ that _ respect I think the difference between us too great infinitely too great his spirits often oppress me but there is something in him which I object to still more
My dear Fanny replied Edmund scarcely hearing her to the end let us not any of us be judged by what we appeared at that period of general folly
As a bystander said Fanny perhaps I saw more than you did and I do think that Mr Rushworth was sometimes very jealous
He will make you happy Fanny I know he will make you happy but you will make him everything
Next to your happiness Fanny his has the first claim on me
She spoke of you Fanny just as she ought
She desires the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself
I should not have mentioned the subject though very anxious to know her sentiments but I had not been in the room five minutes before she began introducing it with all that openness of heart and sweet peculiarity of manner that spirit and ingenuousness which are so much a part of herself
Yes when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by themselves and when once we had begun we had not done with you Fanny till Crawford and Dr Grant came in
My dearest Fanny cried Edmund pressing her arm closer to him do not let the idea of her anger distress you
Her heart is made for love and kindness not for resentment
I wish you could have overheard her tribute of praise I wish you could have seen her countenance when she said that you _ should _ be Henry s wife
And I observed that she always spoke of you as Fanny which she was never used to do and it had a sound of most sisterly cordiality
The surprise of your refusal Fanny seems to have been unbounded
I _ should _ have thought said Fanny after a pause of recollection and exertion that every woman must have felt the possibility of a man s not being approved not being loved by some one of her sex at least let him be ever so generally agreeable
Still however Fanny was oppressed and wearied he saw it in her looks it could not be talked away and attempting it no more he led her directly with the kind authority of a privileged guardian into the house
