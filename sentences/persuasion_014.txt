14 Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and Mrs Musgrove s going than Anne conceived they could have been at all wanted they were yet the first of the family to be at home again and as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to the Lodge
Anne enquired after Captain Benwick
It was all your doing turning to Anne
But Mary did not give into it very graciously whether from not considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in love with an Elliot or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater attraction to Uppercross than herself must be left to be guessed
Anne s good will however was not to be lessened by what she heard
She boldly acknowledged herself flattered and continued her enquiries
I declare Charles I never heard him mention Anne twice all the time I was there
I declare Anne he never talks of you at all
Any acquaintance of Anne s will always be welcome to me was Lady Russell s kind answer
as to being Anne s acquaintance said Mary I think he is rather my acquaintance for I have been seeing him every day this last fortnight
There we differ Mary said Anne
So do I Anne said Charles
With regard to Captain Wentworth though Anne hazarded no enquiries there was voluntary communication sufficient
There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally thinking of Captain Benwick from this time
Lady Russell could not hear the door bell without feeling that it might be his herald nor could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her father s grounds or any visit of charity in the village without wondering whether she might see him or hear of him
Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once when Anne could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again
Anne judging from her own temperament would have deemed such a domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves which Louisa s illness must have so greatly shaken
But Mrs Musgrove who got Anne near her on purpose to thank her most cordially again and again for all her attentions to them concluded a short recapitulation of what she had suffered herself by observing with a happy glance round the room that after all she had gone through nothing was so likely to do her good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home
Anne did not share these feelings
She persisted in a very determined though very silent disinclination for Bath caught the first dim view of the extensive buildings smoking in rain without any wish of seeing them better felt their progress through the streets to be however disagreeable yet too rapid for who would be glad to see her when she arrived
Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance but she felt that she would rather see Mr Elliot again than not which was more than she could say for many other persons in Bath
She was put down in Camden Place and Lady Russell then drove to her own lodgings in Rivers Street
