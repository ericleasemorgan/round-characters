Emma s sense of right however had decided it and besides the consideration of what was due to each brother she had particular pleasure from the circumstance of the late disagreement between Mr Knightley and herself in procuring him the proper invitation
She hoped they might now become friends again
She thought it was time to make up
She certainly had not been in the wrong and he would never own that he had
Concession must be out of the question but it was time to appear to forget that they had ever quarrelled and she hoped it might rather assist the restoration of friendship that when he came into the room she had one of the children with her the youngest a nice little girl about eight months old who was now making her first visit to Hartfield and very happy to be danced about in her aunt s arms
It did assist for though he began with grave looks and short questions he was soon led on to talk of them all in the usual way and to take the child out of her arms with all the unceremoniousness of perfect amity
Emma felt they were friends again and the conviction giving her at first great satisfaction and then a little sauciness she could not help saying as he was admiring the baby What a comfort it is that we think alike about our nephews and nieces
Come my dear Emma let us be friends and say no more about it
Tell your aunt little Emma that she ought to set you a better example than to be renewing old grievances and that if she were not wrong before she is now
That s true she cried very true
Little Emma grow up a better woman than your aunt
The evening was quiet and conversable as Mr Woodhouse declined cards entirely for the sake of comfortable talk with his dear Isabella and the little party made two natural divisions on one side he and his daughter on the other the two Mr Knightleys their subjects totally distinct or very rarely mixing and Emma only occasionally joining in one or the other
My dear Emma suppose we all have a little gruel
Emma could not suppose any such thing knowing as she did that both the Mr Knightleys were as unpersuadable on that article as herself and two basins only were ordered
Come come cried Emma feeling this to be an unsafe subject I must beg you not to talk of the sea
It is not very likely my dear that bathing should have been of use to her and if I had known you were wanting an embrocation I would have spoken to You seem to me to have forgotten Mrs and Miss Bates said Emma I have not heard one inquiry after them
I did not thoroughly understand what you were telling your brother cried Emma about your friend Mr Graham s intending to have a bailiff from Scotland to look after his new estate
And she talked in this way so long and successfully that when forced to give her attention again to her father and sister she had nothing worse to hear than Isabella s kind inquiry after Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax though no great favourite with her in general she was at that moment very happy to assist in praising
I always regret excessively on dear Emma s account that she can not be more at Highbury but now their daughter is married I suppose Colonel and Mrs Campbell will not be able to part with her at all
She would be such a delightful companion for Emma
Emma could not have a better companion than Harriet
and exactly Emma s age
The ejaculation in Emma s ear expressed Ah
And for a little while she hoped he would not talk of it and that a silent rumination might suffice to restore him to the relish of his own smooth gruel
Emma s attempts to stop her father had been vain and when he had reached such a point as this she could not wonder at her brother in law s breaking out
