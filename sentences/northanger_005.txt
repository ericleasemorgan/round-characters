5 Catherine was not so much engaged at the theatre that evening in returning the nods and smiles of Miss Thorpe though they certainly claimed much of her leisure as to forget to look with an inquiring eye for Mr Tilney in every box which her eye could reach but she looked in vain
Here Catherine and Isabella arm in arm again tasted the sweets of friendship in an unreserved conversation they talked much and with much enjoyment but again was Catherine disappointed in her hope of reseeing her partner
This sort of mysteriousness which is always so becoming in a hero threw a fresh grace in Catherine s imagination around his person and manners and increased her anxiety to know more of him
From the Thorpes she could learn nothing for they had been only two days in Bath before they met with Mrs Allen
Isabella was very sure that he must be a charming young man and was equally sure that he must have been delighted with her dear Catherine and would therefore shortly return
She liked him the better for being a clergyman for she must confess herself very partial to the profession and something like a sigh escaped her as she said it
Perhaps Catherine was wrong in not demanding the cause of that gentle emotion but she was not experienced enough in the finesse of love or the duties of friendship to know when delicate raillery was properly called for or when a confidence should be forced
The progress of the friendship between Catherine and Isabella was quick as its beginning had been warm and they passed so rapidly through every gradation of increasing tenderness that there was shortly no fresh proof of it to be given to their friends or themselves
