Mrs Hurst and Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing room
Elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between Darcy and his companion
Your humility Mr Bingley said Elizabeth must disarm reproof
You have only proved by this cried Elizabeth that Mr Bingley did not do justice to his own disposition
Mr Darcy smiled but Elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh
What you ask said Elizabeth is no sacrifice on my side and Mr Darcy had much better finish his letter
Mr Darcy took her advice and did finish his letter
When that business was over he applied to Miss Bingley and Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music
Miss Bingley moved with some alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself
Mrs Hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed Elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some music books that lay on the instrument how frequently Mr Darcy s eyes were fixed on her
She hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange
She could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was something more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present
The supposition did not pain her
She liked him too little to care for his approbation
Elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her
Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane received some assistance from her desire of getting rid of Elizabeth
She often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her guest by talking of their supposed marriage and planning his happiness in such an alliance
I hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your mother in law a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after officers
As for your Elizabeth s picture you must not have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes
At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs Hurst and Elizabeth herself
Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr Darcy she left Elizabeth to walk by herself
But Elizabeth who had not the least inclination to remain with them laughingly answered No no stay where you are
She then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two
