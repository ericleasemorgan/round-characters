However small Elinor s general dependence on Lucy s veracity might be it was impossible for her on serious reflection to suspect it in the present case where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of inventing a falsehood of such a description
What Lucy had asserted to be true therefore Elinor could not dared not longer doubt supported as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs and contradicted by nothing but her own wishes
And so well was she able to answer her own expectations that when she joined them at dinner only two hours after she had first suffered the extinction of all her dearest hopes no one would have supposed from the appearance of the sisters that Elinor was mourning in secret over obstacles which must divide her for ever from the object of her love and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the perfections of a man of whose whole heart she felt thoroughly possessed and whom she expected to see in every carriage which drove near their house
The necessity of concealing from her mother and Marianne what had been entrusted in confidence to herself though it obliged her to unceasing exertion was no aggravation of Elinor s distress
On the contrary it was a relief to her to be spared the communication of what would give such affliction to them and to be saved likewise from hearing that condemnation of Edward which would probably flow from the excess of their partial affection for herself and which was more than she felt equal to support
From their counsel or their conversation she knew she could receive no assistance their tenderness and sorrow must add to her distress while her self command would neither receive encouragement from their example nor from their praise
She was stronger alone and her own good sense so well supported her that her firmness was as unshaken her appearance of cheerfulness as invariable as with regrets so poignant and so fresh it was possible for them to be
Much as she had suffered from her first conversation with Lucy on the subject she soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it and this for more reasons than one
She wanted to hear many particulars of their engagement repeated again she wanted more clearly to understand what Lucy really felt for Edward whether there were any sincerity in her declaration of tender regard for him and she particularly wanted to convince Lucy by her readiness to enter on the matter again and her calmness in conversing on it that she was no otherwise interested in it than as a friend which she very much feared her involuntary agitation in their morning discourse must have left at least doubtful
But indeed while Elinor remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by Edward it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it natural that Lucy should be jealous and that she was so her very confidence was a proof
What other reason for the disclosure of the affair could there be but that Elinor might be informed by it of Lucy s superior claims on Edward and be taught to avoid him in future
One or two meetings of this kind had taken place without affording Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private when Sir John called at the cottage one morning to beg in the name of charity that they would all dine with Lady Middleton that day as he was obliged to attend the club at Exeter and she would otherwise be quite alone except her mother and the two Miss Steeles
Elinor who foresaw a fairer opening for the point she had in view in such a party as this was likely to be more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil and well bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her husband united them together in one noisy purpose immediately accepted the invitation Margaret with her mother s permission was equally compliant and Marianne though always unwilling to join any of their parties was persuaded by her mother who could not bear to have her seclude herself from any chance of amusement to go likewise
The insipidity of the meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected it produced not one novelty of thought or expression and nothing could be less interesting than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and drawing room to the latter the children accompanied them and while they remained there she was too well convinced of the impossibility of engaging Lucy s attention to attempt it
The card table was then placed and Elinor began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of finding time for conversation at the park
Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know ma am said Elinor endeavouring to smooth away the offence and I do not much wonder at it for it is the very best toned piano forte I ever heard
Perhaps continued Elinor if I should happen to cut out I may be of some use to Miss Lucy Steele in rolling her papers for her and there is so much still to be done to the basket that it must be impossible I think for her labour singly to finish it this evening
You are very kind said Lady Middleton to Elinor and as you really like the work perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till another rubber or will you take your chance now
Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals and thus by a little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to practise gained her own end and pleased Lady Middleton at the same time
