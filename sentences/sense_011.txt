Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment
She only wished that it were less openly shown and once or twice did venture to suggest the propriety of some self command to Marianne
Elinor s happiness was not so great
She had already repeated her own history to Elinor three or four times and had Elinor s memory been equal to her means of improvement she might have known very early in their acquaintance all the particulars of Mr Jennings s last illness and what he said to his wife a few minutes before he died
Elinor needed little observation to perceive that her reserve was a mere calmness of manner with which sense had nothing to do
Towards her husband and mother she was the same as to them and intimacy was therefore neither to be looked for nor desired
She had nothing to say one day that she had not said the day before
Her insipidity was invariable for even her spirits were always the same and though she did not oppose the parties arranged by her husband provided every thing were conducted in style and her two eldest children attended her she never appeared to receive more enjoyment from them than she might have experienced in sitting at home and so little did her presence add to the pleasure of the others by any share in their conversation that they were sometimes only reminded of her being amongst them by her solicitude about her troublesome boys
In Colonel Brandon alone of all her new acquaintance did Elinor find a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities excite the interest of friendship or give pleasure as a companion
Her admiration and regard even her sisterly regard was all his own but he was a lover his attentions were wholly Marianne s and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally pleasing
Colonel Brandon unfortunately for himself had no such encouragement to think only of Marianne and in conversing with Elinor he found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her sister
Elinor s compassion for him increased as she had reason to suspect that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him
No replied Elinor her opinions are all romantic
Or rather as I believe she considers them impossible to exist
I believe she does
But how she contrives it without reflecting on the character of her own father who had himself two wives I know not
A few years however will settle her opinions on the reasonable basis of common sense and observation and then they may be more easy to define and to justify than they now are by any body but herself
I can not agree with you there said Elinor
I once knew a lady who in temper and mind greatly resembled your sister who thought and judged like her but who from an enforced change from a series of unfortunate circumstances Here he stopt suddenly appeared to think that he had said too much and by his countenance gave rise to conjectures which might not otherwise have entered Elinor s head
Elinor attempted no more
But Marianne in her place would not have done so little
The whole story would have been speedily formed under her active imagination and every thing established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love
