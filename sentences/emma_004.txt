Quick and decided in her ways Emma lost no time in inviting encouraging and telling her to come very often and as their acquaintance increased so did their satisfaction in each other
As a walking companion Emma had very early foreseen how useful she might find her
Emma was obliged to fancy what she liked but she could never believe that in the same situation she should not have discovered the truth
Emma encouraged her talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs Martin s having two parlours two very good parlours indeed one of them quite as large as Mrs Goddard s drawing room and of her having an upper maid who had lived five and twenty years with her and of their having eight cows two of them Alderneys and one a little Welch cow a very pretty little Welch cow indeed and of Mrs Martin s saying as she was so fond of it it should be called her cow and of their having a very handsome summer house in their garden where some day next year they were all to drink tea a very handsome summer house large enough to hold a dozen people
thought Emma
Emma watched her through the fluctuations of this speech and saw no alarming symptoms of love
The young man had been the first admirer but she trusted there was no other hold and that there would be no serious difficulty on Harriet s side to oppose any friendly arrangement of her own
Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey and walking a few yards forward while they talked together soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr Robert Martin
His appearance was very neat and he looked like a sensible young man but his person had no other advantage and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in Harriet s inclination
I wonder he did not remember the book was all Harriet s answer and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself
She therefore said no more for some time
Her next beginning was In one respect perhaps Mr Elton s manners are superior to Mr Knightley s or Mr Weston s
Mr Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet s head
He had a comfortable home for her and Emma imagined a very sufficient income for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large he was known to have some independent property and she thought very highly of him as a good humoured well meaning respectable young man without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world
She had already satisfied herself that he thought Harriet a beautiful girl which she trusted with such frequent meetings at Hartfield was foundation enough on his side and on Harriet s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy
