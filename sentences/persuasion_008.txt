His profession qualified him his disposition lead him to talk and That was in the year six That happened before I went to sea in the year six occurred in the course of the first evening they spent together and though his voice did not falter and though she had no reason to suppose his eye wandering towards her while he spoke Anne felt the utter impossibility from her knowledge of his mind that he could be unvisited by remembrance any more than herself
There must be the same immediate association of thought though she was very far from conceiving it to be of equal pain
With the exception perhaps of Admiral and Mrs Croft who seemed particularly attached and happy Anne could allow no other exceptions even among the married couples there could have been no two hearts so open no tastes so similar no feelings so in unison no countenances so beloved
When he talked she heard the same voice and discerned the same mind
There was a very general ignorance of all naval matters throughout the party and he was very much questioned and especially by the two Miss Musgroves who seemed hardly to have any eyes but for him as to the manner of living on board daily regulations food hours c and their surprise at his accounts at learning the degree of accommodation and arrangement which was practicable drew from him some pleasant ridicule which reminded Anne of the early days when she too had been ignorant and she too had been accused of supposing sailors to be living on board without anything to eat or any cook to dress it if there were or any servant to wait or any knife and fork to use
From thus listening and thinking she was roused by a whisper of Mrs Musgrove s who overcome by fond regrets could not help saying Ah
Anne suppressed a smile and listened kindly while Mrs Musgrove relieved her heart a little more and for a few minutes therefore could not keep pace with the conversation of the others
Anne s shudderings were to herself alone but the Miss Musgroves could be as open as they were sincere in their exclamations of pity and horror
There was a momentary expression in Captain Wentworth s face at this speech a certain glance of his bright eye and curl of his handsome mouth which convinced Anne that instead of sharing in Mrs Musgrove s kind wishes as to her son he had probably been at some pains to get rid of him but it was too transient an indulgence of self amusement to be detected by any who understood him less than herself in another moment he was perfectly collected and serious and almost instantly afterwards coming up to the sofa on which she and Mrs Musgrove were sitting took a place by the latter and entered into conversation with her in a low voice about her son doing it with so much sympathy and natural grace as shewed the kindest consideration for all that was real and unabsurd in the parent s feelings
Mrs Musgrove was of a comfortable substantial size infinitely more fitted by nature to express good cheer and good humour than tenderness and sentiment and while the agitations of Anne s slender form and pensive face may be considered as very completely screened Captain Wentworth should be allowed some credit for the self command with which he attended to her large fat sighings over the destiny of a son whom alive nobody had cared for
I declare I have not a comfort or an indulgence about me even at Kellynch Hall with a kind bow to Anne beyond what I always had in most of the ships I have lived in and they have been five altogether
Nothing to the purpose replied her brother
On its being proposed Anne offered her services as usual and though her eyes would sometimes fill with tears as she sat at the instrument she was extremely glad to be employed and desired nothing in return but to be unobserved
She felt that he had every thing to elevate him which general attention and deference and especially the attention of all the young women could do
These were some of the thoughts which occupied Anne while her fingers were mechanically at work proceeding for half an hour together equally without error and without consciousness
Once she felt that he was looking at herself observing her altered features perhaps trying to trace in them the ruins of the face which had once charmed him and once she knew that he must have spoken of her she was hardly aware of it till she heard the answer but then she was sure of his having asked his partner whether Miss Elliot never danced
Anne did not wish for more of such looks and speeches
