She went however and when they reached the farm and she was to be put down at the end of the broad neat gravel walk which led between espalier apple trees to the front door the sight of every thing which had given her so much pleasure the autumn before was beginning to revive a little local agitation and when they parted Emma observed her to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity which determined her not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour
She went on herself to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married and settled in Donwell
The quarter of an hour brought her punctually to the white gate again and Miss Smith receiving her summons was with her without delay and unattended by any alarming young man
She was feeling too much but at last Emma collected from her enough to understand the sort of meeting and the sort of pain it was creating
She had seen only Mrs Martin and the two girls
They had received her doubtingly if not coolly and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last when Mrs Martin s saying all of a sudden that she thought Miss Smith was grown had brought on a more interesting subject and a warmer manner
They all seemed to remember the day the hour the party the occasion to feel the same consciousness the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding and they were just growing again like themselves Harriet as Emma must suspect as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy when the carriage reappeared and all was over
Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago
Emma could not but picture it all and feel how justly they might resent how naturally Harriet must suffer
This is too bad cried Emma as they turned away
And she leaned back in the corner to indulge her murmurs or to reason them away probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not ill disposed mind
Presently the carriage stopt she looked up it was stopt by Mr and Mrs Weston who were standing to speak to her
To know that she thought his coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so and sincerely did she rejoice in their joy
The worn out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming and in the rapidity of half a moment s thought she hoped Mr Elton would now be talked of no more
Mr Weston gave her the history of the engagements at Enscombe which allowed his son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his command as well as the route and the method of his journey and she listened and smiled and congratulated
Emma could imagine she saw a touch of the arm at this speech from his wife
Well well I am ready and turning again to Emma but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man you have only had my account you know I dare say he is really nothing extraordinary though his own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction
Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing
Think of me to morrow my dear Emma about four o clock was Mrs Weston s parting injunction spoken with some anxiety and meant only for her
Emma s spirits were mounted quite up to happiness every thing wore a different air James and his horses seemed not half so sluggish as before
When she looked at the hedges she thought the elder at least must soon be coming out and when she turned round to Harriet she saw something like a look of spring a tender smile even there
But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time
Emma was directly sure that he knew how to make himself agreeable the conviction was strengthened by what followed
That he should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before passed suspiciously through Emma s brain but still if it were a falsehood it was a pleasant one and pleasantly handled
On his side were the inquiries Was she a horsewoman
You can not see too much perfection in Mrs Weston for my feelings said Emma were you to guess her to be eighteen I should listen with pleasure but she would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words
Do n t let her imagine that you have spoken of her as a pretty young woman
Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other which had taken strong possession of her mind had ever crossed his and whether his compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence or proofs of defiance
She must see more of him to understand his ways at present she only felt they were agreeable
She had no doubt of what Mr Weston was often thinking about
His quick eye she detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression and even when he might have determined not to look she was confident that he was often listening
Her own father s perfect exemption from any thought of the kind the entire deficiency in him of all such sort of penetration or suspicion was a most comfortable circumstance
She blessed the favouring blindness
I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours turning to Emma a lady residing in or near Highbury a family of the name of Fairfax
I have heard her speak of the acquaintance said Emma she is a very elegant young woman
He agreed to it but with so quiet a Yes as inclined her almost to doubt his real concurrence and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it
Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day with full confidence in their comfort
