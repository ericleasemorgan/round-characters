Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an unpleasant event however certain the mind may be told to consider it and certainty itself
She now found that in spite of herself she had always admitted a hope while Edward remained single that something would occur to prevent his marrying Lucy that some resolution of his own some mediation of friends or some more eligible opportunity of establishment for the lady would arise to assist the happiness of all
Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London would write to them to announce the event and give farther particulars but day after day passed off and brought no letter no tidings
Though uncertain that any one were to blame she found fault with every absent friend
was an inquiry which sprung from the impatience of her mind to have something going on
Scarcely had she so determined it when the figure of a man on horseback drew her eyes to the window
Now she could hear more and she trembled in expectation of it
Were it possible she must say it must be Edward
She looked again
He had just dismounted she could not be mistaken it _ was _ Edward
She moved away and sat down
His countenance as he entered the room was not too happy even for Elinor
Elinor s lips had moved with her mother s and when the moment of action was over she wished that she had shaken hands with him too
But it was then too late and with a countenance meaning to be open she sat down again and talked of the weather
When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season a very awful pause took place
Elinor resolving to exert herself though fearing the sound of her own voice now said Is Mrs Ferrars at Longstaple
I meant said Elinor taking up some work from the table to enquire for Mrs _ Edward _ Ferrars
She dared not look up but her mother and Marianne both turned their eyes on him
was repeated by Marianne and her mother in an accent of the utmost amazement and though Elinor could not speak even _ her _ eyes were fixed on him with the same impatient wonder
His words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor who sat with her head leaning over her work in a state of such agitation as made her hardly know where she was
Elinor could sit it no longer
She almost ran out of the room and as soon as the door was closed burst into tears of joy which at first she thought would never cease
Edward who had till then looked any where rather than at her saw her hurry away and perhaps saw or even heard her emotion for immediately afterwards he fell into a reverie which no remarks no inquiries no affectionate address of Mrs Dashwood could penetrate and at last without saying a word quitted the room and walked out towards the village leaving the others in the greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his situation so wonderful and so sudden a perplexity which they had no means of lessening but by their own conjectures
