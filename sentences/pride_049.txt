49 Two days after Mr Bennet s return as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to Miss Bennet I beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so I took the liberty of coming to ask
Jane who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth soon lagged behind while her sister panting for breath came up with him and eagerly cried out Oh papa what news what news
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand
Elizabeth read on I have seen them both
cried Elizabeth when she had finished
Can it be possible that he will marry her
Wickham is not so undeserving then as we thought him said her sister
cried Elizabeth
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote
my dear father she cried come back and write immediately
And may I ask said Elizabeth but the terms I suppose must be complied with
That is very true said Elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before
No said her father Wickham s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds
cried Elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves
If he were ever able to learn what Wickham s debts have been said Elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what Mr Gardiner has done for them because Wickham has not sixpence of his own
Their conduct has been such replied Elizabeth as neither you nor I nor anybody can ever forget
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing table and they went up stairs together
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom
