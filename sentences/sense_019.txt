Elinor placed all that was astonishing in this way of acting to his mother s account and it was happy for her that he had a mother whose character was so imperfectly known to her as to be the general excuse for every thing strange on the part of her son
This desponding turn of mind though it could not be communicated to Mrs Dashwood gave additional pain to them all in the parting which shortly took place and left an uncomfortable impression on Elinor s feelings especially which required some trouble and time to subdue
But as it was her determination to subdue it and to prevent herself from appearing to suffer more than what all her family suffered on his going away she did not adopt the method so judiciously employed by Marianne on a similar occasion to augment and fix her sorrow by seeking silence solitude and idleness
Elinor sat down to her drawing table as soon as he was out of the house busily employed herself the whole day neither sought nor avoided the mention of his name appeared to interest herself almost as much as ever in the general concerns of the family and if by this conduct she did not lessen her own grief it was at least prevented from unnecessary increase and her mother and sisters were spared much solicitude on her account
Such behaviour as this so exactly the reverse of her own appeared no more meritorious to Marianne than her own had seemed faulty to her
Without shutting herself up from her family or leaving the house in determined solitude to avoid them or lying awake the whole night to indulge meditation Elinor found every day afforded her leisure enough to think of Edward and of Edward s behaviour in every possible variety which the different state of her spirits at different times could produce with tenderness pity approbation censure and doubt
There were moments in abundance when if not by the absence of her mother and sisters at least by the nature of their employments conversation was forbidden among them and every effect of solitude was produced
Her mind was inevitably at liberty her thoughts could not be chained elsewhere and the past and the future on a subject so interesting must be before her must force her attention and engross her memory her reflection and her fancy
From a reverie of this kind as she sat at her drawing table she was roused one morning soon after Edward s leaving them by the arrival of company
She happened to be quite alone
The closing of the little gate at the entrance of the green court in front of the house drew her eyes to the window and she saw a large party walking up to the door
As Elinor was certain of seeing her in a couple of minutes without taking that liberty she begged to be excused
I thought of nothing but whether it might not be Colonel Brandon come back again so I said to Sir John I do think I hear a carriage perhaps it is Colonel Brandon come back again Elinor was obliged to turn from her in the middle of her story to receive the rest of the party Lady Middleton introduced the two strangers Mrs Dashwood and Margaret came down stairs at the same time and they all sat down to look at one another while Mrs Jennings continued her story as she walked through the passage into the parlour attended by Sir John
You may believe how glad we all were to see them added Mrs Jennings leaning forward towards Elinor and speaking in a low voice as if she meant to be heard by no one else though they were seated on different sides of the room but however I ca n t help wishing they had not travelled quite so fast nor made such a long journey of it for they came all round by London upon account of some business for you know nodding significantly and pointing to her daughter it was wrong in her situation
I wanted her to stay at home and rest this morning but she would come with us she longed so much to see you all
They mean no less to be civil and kind to us now said Elinor by these frequent invitations than by those which we received from them a few weeks ago
