XII Till now that she was threatened with its loss Emma had never known how much of her happiness depended on being first with Mr Knightley first in interest and affection
This point was just arranged when a visitor arrived to tear Emma s thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them sleeping or waking the last twenty four hours Mrs Weston who had been calling on her daughter in law elect and took Hartfield in her way home almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview
Mr Weston had accompanied her to Mrs Bates s and gone through his share of this essential attention most handsomely but she having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her in an airing was now returned with much more to say and much more to say with satisfaction than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs Bates s parlour with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings could have afforded
A little curiosity Emma had and she made the most of it while her friend related
Emma smiled and felt that Mr Weston had very good reason for saying so
I will not say that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments but I can say that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour and the quivering lip Emma which uttered it was an attestation that I felt at my heart
said Emma
She thinks herself wrong then for having consented to a private engagement
No one I believe can blame her more than she is disposed to blame herself
The consequence said she has been a state of perpetual suffering to me and so it ought
said Emma again
She loves him then excessively I suppose
It must have been from attachment only that she could be led to form the engagement
Her affection must have overpowered her judgment
Yes I have no doubt of her being extremely attached to him
I am afraid returned Emma sighing that I must often have contributed to make her unhappy
But she probably had something of that in her thoughts when alluding to the misunderstandings which he had given us hints of before
One natural consequence of the evil she had involved herself in she said was that of making her unreasonable
The consciousness of having done amiss had exposed her to a thousand inquietudes and made her captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him to bear
I did not make the allowances said she which I ought to have done for his temper and spirits his delightful spirits and that gaiety that playfulness of disposition which under any other circumstances would I am sure have been as constantly bewitching to me as they were at first
She then began to speak of you and of the great kindness you had shewn her during her illness and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected desired me whenever I had an opportunity to thank you I could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her good
She was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself
If I did not know her to be happy now said Emma seriously which in spite of every little drawback from her scrupulous conscience she must be I could not bear these thanks for oh
She talked with a great deal of reason and at least equal affection but she had too much to urge for Emma s attention it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell she forgot to attempt to listen and when Mrs Weston ended with We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for you know but I hope it will soon come she was obliged to pause before she answered and at last obliged to answer at random before she could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for
Are you well my Emma
Mrs Weston s communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection by increasing her esteem and compassion and her sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax
She bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been in some measure the cause
Had she followed Mr Knightley s known wishes in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax which was every way her due had she tried to know her better had she done her part towards intimacy had she endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith she must in all probability have been spared from every pain which pressed on her now
And if he were to be lost to them for Harriet s sake if he were to be thought of hereafter as finding in Harriet s society all that he wanted if Harriet were to be the chosen the first the dearest the friend the wife to whom he looked for all the best blessings of existence what could be increasing Emma s wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her mind that it had been all her own work
When it came to such a pitch as this she was not able to refrain from a start or a heavy sigh or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn was in the resolution of her own better conduct and the hope that however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her life to the past it would yet find her more rational more acquainted with herself and leave her less to regret when it were gone
