10 The Allens Thorpes and Morlands all met in the evening at the theatre and as Catherine and Isabella sat together there was then an opportunity for the latter to utter some few of the many thousand things which had been collecting within her for communication in the immeasurable length of time which had divided them
My beloved Catherine have I got you at last
was her address on Catherine s entering the box and sitting by her
Now Mr Morland for he was close to her on the other side I shall not speak another word to you all the rest of the evening so I charge you not to expect it
My sweetest Catherine how have you been this long age
No said Catherine he is not here I can not see him anywhere
Catherine s resolution of endeavouring to meet Miss Tilney again continued in full force the next morning and till the usual moment of going to the pump room she felt some alarm from the dread of a second prevention
The female part of the Thorpe family attended by James Morland appeared among the crowd in less than a quarter of an hour and Catherine immediately took her usual place by the side of her friend
James who was now in constant attendance maintained a similar position and separating themselves from the rest of their party they walked in that manner for some time till Catherine began to doubt the happiness of a situation which confining her entirely to her friend and brother gave her very little share in the notice of either
They were always engaged in some sentimental discussion or lively dispute but their sentiment was conveyed in such whispering voices and their vivacity attended with so much laughter that though Catherine s supporting opinion was not unfrequently called for by one or the other she was never able to give any from not having heard a word of the subject
At length however she was empowered to disengage herself from her friend by the avowed necessity of speaking to Miss Tilney whom she most joyfully saw just entering the room with Mrs Hughes and whom she instantly joined with a firmer determination to be acquainted than she might have had courage to command had she not been urged by the disappointment of the day before
was an artless exclamation of Catherine s towards the close of their conversation which at once surprised and amused her companion
she replied with a smile
You can not think added Catherine after a moment s silence how surprised I was to see him again
I hope I shall have the pleasure of seeing you again soon said Catherine
This civility was duly returned and they parted on Miss Tilney s side with some knowledge of her new acquaintance s feelings and on Catherine s without the smallest consciousness of having explained them
She went home very happy
The morning had answered all her hopes and the evening of the following day was now the object of expectation the future good
What gown and what head dress she should wear on the occasion became her chief concern
She can not be justified in it
Catherine knew all this very well her great aunt had read her a lecture on the subject only the Christmas before and yet she lay awake ten minutes on Wednesday night debating between her spotted and her tamboured muslin and nothing but the shortness of the time prevented her buying a new one for the evening
This would have been an error in judgment great though not uncommon from which one of the other sex rather than her own a brother rather than a great aunt might have warned her for man only can be aware of the insensibility of man towards a new gown
But not one of these grave reflections troubled the tranquillity of Catherine
She entered the rooms on Thursday evening with feelings very different from what had attended her thither the Monday before
She had then been exulting in her engagement to Thorpe and was now chiefly anxious to avoid his sight lest he should engage her again for though she could not dared not expect that Mr Tilney should ask her a third time to dance her wishes hopes and plans all centred in nothing less
As soon as they were joined by the Thorpes Catherine s agony began she fidgeted about if John Thorpe came towards her hid herself as much as possible from his view and when he spoke to her pretended not to hear him
The cotillions were over the country dancing beginning and she saw nothing of the Tilneys
Do not be frightened my dear Catherine whispered Isabella but I am really going to dance with your brother again
Catherine had neither time nor inclination to answer
The others walked away John Thorpe was still in view and she gave herself up for lost
That she might not appear however to observe or expect him she kept her eyes intently fixed on her fan and a self condemnation for her folly in supposing that among such a crowd they should even meet with the Tilneys in any reasonable time had just passed through her mind when she suddenly found herself addressed and again solicited to dance by Mr Tilney himself
With what sparkling eyes and ready motion she granted his request and with how pleasing a flutter of heart she went with him to the set may be easily imagined
To escape and as she believed so narrowly escape John Thorpe and to be asked so immediately on his joining her asked by Mr Tilney as if he had sought her on purpose
it did not appear to her that life could supply any greater felicity
Scarcely had they worked themselves into the quiet possession of a place however when her attention was claimed by John Thorpe who stood behind her
Catherine satisfied his curiosity
This was the last sentence by which he could weary Catherine s attention for he was just then borne off by the resistless pressure of a long string of passing ladies
Her partner now drew near and said That gentleman would have put me out of patience had he stayed with you half a minute longer
Soon after their reaching the bottom of the set Catherine perceived herself to be earnestly regarded by a gentleman who stood among the lookers on immediately behind her partner
He was a very handsome man of a commanding aspect past the bloom but not past the vigour of life and with his eye still directed towards her she saw him presently address Mr Tilney in a familiar whisper
Confused by his notice and blushing from the fear of its being excited by something wrong in her appearance she turned away her head
But while she did so the gentleman retreated and her partner coming nearer said I see that you guess what I have just been asked
Catherine s answer was only Oh
With real interest and strong admiration did her eye now follow the general as he moved through the crowd and How handsome a family they are
was her secret remark
This was readily agreed to with only a proviso of Miss Tilney s that it did not rain which Catherine was sure it would not
At twelve o clock they were to call for her in Pulteney Street and Remember twelve o clock was her parting speech to her new friend
Of her other her older her more established friend Isabella of whose fidelity and worth she had enjoyed a fortnight s experience she scarcely saw anything during the evening
Yet though longing to make her acquainted with her happiness she cheerfully submitted to the wish of Mr Allen which took them rather early away and her spirits danced within her as she danced in her chair all the way home
