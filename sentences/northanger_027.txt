26 From this time the subject was frequently canvassed by the three young people and Catherine found with some surprise that her two young friends were perfectly agreed in considering Isabella s want of consequence and fortune as likely to throw great difficulties in the way of her marrying their brother
Henry was greatly honoured and very happy and Catherine was quite delighted with the scheme
A ball itself could not have been more welcome to Catherine than this little excursion so strong was her desire to be acquainted with Woodston and her heart was still bounding with joy when Henry about an hour afterwards came booted and greatcoated into the room where she and Eleanor were sitting and said I am come young ladies in a very moralizing strain to observe that our pleasures in this world are always to be paid for and that we often purchase them at a great disadvantage giving ready monied actual happiness for a draft on the future that may not be honoured
said Catherine with a very long face
He went and it being at any time a much simpler operation to Catherine to doubt her own judgment than Henry s she was very soon obliged to give him credit for being right however disagreeable to her his going
But the inexplicability of the general s conduct dwelt much on her thoughts
That he was very particular in his eating she had by her own unassisted observation already discovered but why he should say one thing so positively and mean another all the while was most unaccountable
This was the sad finale of every reflection and Captain Tilney s letter would certainly come in his absence and Wednesday she was very sure would be wet
Her brother so unhappy and her loss in Isabella so great and Eleanor s spirits always affected by Henry s absence
It came it was fine and Catherine trod on air
Catherine was ashamed to say how pretty she thought it as the general seemed to think an apology necessary for the flatness of the country and the size of the village but in her heart she preferred it to any place she had ever been at and looked with great admiration at every neat house above the rank of a cottage and at all the little chandler s shops which they passed
Catherine s mind was too full as she entered the house for her either to observe or to say a great deal and till called on by the general for her opinion of it she had very little idea of the room in which she was sitting
Upon looking round it then she perceived in a moment that it was the most comfortable room in the world but she was too guarded to say so and the coldness of her praise disappointed him
We are not calling it a good house said he
Catherine did not hear enough of this speech to understand or be pained by it and other subjects being studiously brought forward and supported by Henry at the same time that a tray full of refreshments was introduced by his servant the general was shortly restored to his complacency and Catherine to all her usual ease of spirits
The room in question was of a commodious well proportioned size and handsomely fitted up as a dining parlour and on their quitting it to walk round the grounds she was shown first into a smaller apartment belonging peculiarly to the master of the house and made unusually tidy on the occasion and afterwards into what was to be the drawing room with the appearance of which though unfurnished Catherine was delighted enough even to satisfy the general
It was a prettily shaped room the windows reaching to the ground and the view from them pleasant though only over green meadows and she expressed her admiration at the moment with all the honest simplicity with which she felt it
Such a compliment recalled all Catherine s consciousness and silenced her directly and though pointedly applied to by the general for her choice of the prevailing colour of the paper and hangings nothing like an opinion on the subject could be drawn from her
The influence of fresh objects and fresh air however was of great use in dissipating these embarrassing associations and having reached the ornamental part of the premises consisting of a walk round two sides of a meadow on which Henry s genius had begun to act about half a year ago she was sufficiently recovered to think it prettier than any pleasure ground she had ever been in before though there was not a shrub in it higher than the green bench in the corner
A saunter into other meadows and through part of the village with a visit to the stables to examine some improvements and a charming game of play with a litter of puppies just able to roll about brought them to four o clock when Catherine scarcely thought it could be three
She could not but observe that the abundance of the dinner did not seem to create the smallest astonishment in the general nay that he was even looking at the side table for cold meat which was not there
At six o clock the general having taken his coffee the carriage again received them and so gratifying had been the tenor of his conduct throughout the whole visit so well assured was her mind on the subject of his expectations that could she have felt equally confident of the wishes of his son Catherine would have quitted Woodston with little anxiety as to the How or the When she might return to it
