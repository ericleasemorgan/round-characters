Emma had hardly expected them for Mr Weston who had called in for half a minute in order to hear that his son was very handsome knew nothing of their plans and it was an agreeable surprize to her therefore to perceive them walking up to the house together arm in arm
She was wanting to see him again and especially to see him in company with Mrs Weston upon his behaviour to whom her opinion of him was to depend
And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment as their visit included all the rest of the morning
He was delighted with every thing admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr Woodhouse s ear and when their going farther was resolved on confessed his wish to be made acquainted with the whole village and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed
Emma watched and decided that with such feelings as were now shewn it could not be fairly supposed that he had been ever voluntarily absenting himself that he had not been acting a part or making a parade of insincere professions and that Mr Knightley certainly had not done him justice
He argued like a young man very much bent on dancing and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills
At last he was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged Emma recollected his intended visit the day before and asked him if he had paid it
Emma would not agree to this and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax s complexion
It was certainly never brilliant but she would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general and there was a softness and delicacy in her skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her face
Well said Emma there is no disputing about taste
At least you admire her except her complexion
I can not separate Miss Fairfax and her complexion
Did you see her often at Weymouth
You get upon delicate subjects Emma said Mrs Weston smiling remember that I am here
I certainly do forget to think of her said Emma as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend
repeated Emma
You forget how much she belongs to Highbury
I have heard her every year of our lives since we both began
She plays charmingly
She appeared to me to play well that is with considerable taste but I know nothing of the matter myself
I have been used to hear her s admired and I remember one proof of her being thought to play well a man a very musical man and in love with another woman engaged to her on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he could hear the other
said Emma highly amused
said Emma laughing
He perfectly agreed with her and after walking together so long and thinking so much alike Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him that she could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting
He was not exactly what she had expected less of the man of the world in some of his notions less of the spoiled child of fortune therefore better than she had expected
She was particularly struck by his manner of considering Mr Elton s house which as well as the church he would go and look at and would not join them in finding much fault with
But Emma in her own mind determined that he did know what he was talking about and that he shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life and to marry from worthy motives
