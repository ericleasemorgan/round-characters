54 As soon as they were gone Elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more
Mr Darcy s behaviour astonished and vexed her
Why if he came only to be silent grave and indifferent said she did he come at all
She could settle it in no way that gave her pleasure
Her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than Elizabeth
Now said she that this first meeting is over I feel perfectly easy
Yes very indifferent indeed said Elizabeth laughingly
When they repaired to the dining room Elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether Bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister
Her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself
Elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend
He bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that Bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards Mr Darcy with an expression of half laughing alarm
His behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded Elizabeth that if left wholly to himself Jane s happiness and his own would be speedily secured
Though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour
It gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour
Mr Darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them
He was on one side of her mother
She knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage
She was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did
Her mother s ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to Elizabeth s mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family
She was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance
Anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawing room before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil
She looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend
If he does not come to me _ then _ said she I shall give him up for ever
The gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas
the ladies had crowded round the table where Miss Bennet was making tea and Elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair
And on the gentlemen s approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper The men sha n t come and part us I am determined
She followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly
He stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young lady s whispering to Elizabeth again he walked away
When the tea things were removed and the card tables placed the ladies all rose and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mother s rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party
She now lost every expectation of pleasure
They were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself
It has been a very agreeable day said Miss Bennet to Elizabeth
Elizabeth smiled
