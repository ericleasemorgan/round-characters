Thank you ma am said Elinor
You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose said Elinor with a faint smile
Elinor did not quite understand the beginning of Mrs Jennings s speech neither did she think it worth inquiring into and therefore only replied to its conclusion
Certainly ma am replied Elinor not hearing much of what she said and more anxious to be alone than to be mistress of the subject
Elinor had just been congratulating herself in the midst of her perplexity that however difficult it might be to express herself properly by letter it was at least preferable to giving the information by word of mouth when her visitor entered to force her upon this greatest exertion of all
Her astonishment and confusion were very great on his so sudden appearance
She had not seen him before since his engagement became public and therefore not since his knowing her to be acquainted with it which with the consciousness of what she had been thinking of and what she had to tell him made her feel particularly uncomfortable for some minutes
Whether he had asked her pardon for his intrusion on first coming into the room he could not recollect but determining to be on the safe side he made his apology in form as soon as he could say any thing after taking a chair
You would not have gone however said Elinor recovering herself and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible without receiving our good wishes even if we had not been able to give them in person
Yes continued Elinor gathering more resolution as some of the worst was over Colonel Brandon means it as a testimony of his concern for what has lately passed for the cruel situation in which the unjustifiable conduct of your family has placed you a concern which I am sure Marianne myself and all your friends must share and likewise as a proof of his high esteem for your general character and his particular approbation of your behaviour on the present occasion
For a short time he sat deep in thought after Elinor had ceased to speak at last and as if it were rather an effort he said Colonel Brandon seems a man of great worth and respectability
Indeed replied Elinor I believe that you will find him on farther acquaintance all that you have heard him to be and as you will be such very near neighbours for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion house it is particularly important that he _ should _ be all this
Edward made no answer but when she had turned away her head gave her a look so serious so earnest so uncheerful as seemed to say that he might hereafter wish the distance between the parsonage and the mansion house much greater
Elinor told him the number of the house
Elinor did not offer to detain him and they parted with a very earnest assurance on _ her _ side of her unceasing good wishes for his happiness in every change of situation that might befall him on _ his _ with rather an attempt to return the same good will than the power of expressing it
When I see him again said Elinor to herself as the door shut him out I shall see him the husband of Lucy
When Mrs Jennings came home though she returned from seeing people whom she had never seen before and of whom therefore she must have a great deal to say her mind was so much more occupied by the important secret in her possession than by anything else that she reverted to it again as soon as Elinor appeared
Well my dear she cried I sent you up the young man
Really said Elinor I know so little of these kind of forms that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time or the preparation necessary but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination
My dear ma am said Elinor what can you be thinking of
Elinor was quite of her opinion as to the probability of their not waiting for any thing more
