Emma had feelings less of curiosity than of pride or propriety to make her resolve on not being the last to pay her respects and she made a point of Harriet s going with her that the worst of the business might be gone through as soon as possible
The visit was of course short and there was so much embarrassment and occupation of mind to shorten it that Emma would not allow herself entirely to form an opinion of the lady and on no account to give one beyond the nothing meaning terms of being elegantly dressed and very pleasing
She did not really like her
She would not be in a hurry to find fault but she suspected that there was no elegance ease but not elegance
She was almost sure that for a young woman a stranger a bride there was too much ease
Emma thought at least it would turn out so
As for Mr Elton his manners did not appear but no she would not permit a hasty or a witty word from herself about his manners
There was a little hesitation in Emma s answer
When the visit was returned Emma made up her mind
She could then see more and judge better
Emma made as slight a reply as she could but it was fully sufficient for Mrs Elton who only wanted to be talking herself
Emma doubted the truth of this sentiment
She had a great idea that people who had extensive grounds themselves cared very little for the extensive grounds of any body else but it was not worth while to attack an error so double dyed and therefore only said in reply When you have seen more of this country I am afraid you will think you have overrated Hartfield
Emma was silenced
It was as much as Emma could bear without being impolite
The idea of her being indebted to Mrs Elton for what was called an introduction of her going into public under the auspices of a friend of Mrs Elton s probably some vulgar dashing widow who with the help of a boarder just made a shift to live
We can not suppose said Emma smiling that Mr Elton would hesitate to assure you of there being a very musical society in Highbury and I hope you will not find he has outstepped the truth more than may be pardoned in consideration of the motive
But every thing of that kind said Emma will soon be in so regular a train Well said Mrs Elton laughing we shall see
Emma finding her so determined upon neglecting her music had nothing more to say and after a moment s pause Mrs Elton chose another subject
Emma was almost too much astonished to answer but Mrs Elton hardly waited for the affirmative before she went on
Mrs Weston s manners said Emma were always particularly good
Emma was quite at a loss
The tone implied some old acquaintance and how could she possibly guess
They were off and Emma could breathe
was her immediate exclamation
Emma had done
Her father was growing nervous and could not understand her
Her mind returned to Mrs Elton s offences and long very long did they occupy her
