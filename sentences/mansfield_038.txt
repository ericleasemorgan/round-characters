With such thoughts as these among ten hundred others Fanny proceeded in her journey safely and cheerfully and as expeditiously as could rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February
They entered Oxford but she could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund s college as they passed along and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury where a comfortable meal uniting dinner and supper wound up the enjoyments and fatigues of the day
Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance passage of the house and in her mother s arms who met her there with looks of true kindness and with features which Fanny loved the more because they brought her aunt Bertram s before her and there were her two sisters Susan a well grown fine girl of fourteen and Betsey the youngest of the family about five both glad to see her in their way though with no advantage of manner in receiving her
You know you had but just settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room and I could not get Rebecca to give me any help
Susan had an open sensible countenance she was like William and Fanny hoped to find her like him in disposition and goodwill towards herself
said Fanny come and shew it to me
she was so fond of it Fanny that she would have it lay by her in bed all through her illness
It was the gift of her good godmother old Mrs Admiral Maxwell only six weeks before she was taken for death
Well she was taken away from evil to come
