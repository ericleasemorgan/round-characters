15 Early the next day a note from Isabella speaking peace and tenderness in every line and entreating the immediate presence of her friend on a matter of the utmost importance hastened Catherine in the happiest state of confidence and curiosity to Edgar s Buildings
The two youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour and on Anne s quitting it to call her sister Catherine took the opportunity of asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday s party
Maria desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it and Catherine immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful scheme in the world that nobody could imagine how charming it had been and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive
Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction
Maria was without ceremony sent away and Isabella embracing Catherine thus began Yes my dear Catherine it is so indeed your penetration has not deceived you
Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance
My dear Catherine you alone who know my heart can judge of my present happiness
Catherine s understanding began to awake an idea of the truth suddenly darted into her mind and with the natural blush of so new an emotion she cried out Good heaven
Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest wonder and joy
Her brother and her friend engaged
New to such circumstances the importance of it appeared unspeakably great and she contemplated it as one of those grand events of which the ordinary course of life can hardly afford a return
The strength of her feelings she could not express the nature of them however contented her friend
Delighting however as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the connection it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her in tender anticipations
You will be so infinitely dearer to me my Catherine than either Anne or Maria I feel that I shall be so much more attached to my dear Morland s family than to my own
This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine
Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love for though exceedingly fond of her brother and partial to all his endowments she had never in her life thought him handsome
Catherine the many sleepless nights I have had on your brother s account
Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer but ashamed of an ignorance little expected she dared no longer contest the point nor refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her
Catherine endeavoured to persuade her as she was herself persuaded that her father and mother would never oppose their son s wishes
It is impossible said she for parents to be more kind or more desirous of their children s happiness I have no doubt of their consenting immediately
Here Catherine again discerned the force of love
My sweet Catherine in _ your _ generous heart I know it would signify nothing but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many
This charming sentiment recommended as much by sense as novelty gave Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her acquaintance and she thought her friend never looked more lovely than in uttering the grand idea
I am sure they will consent was her frequent declaration I am sure they will be delighted with you
cried Catherine
Catherine wished to congratulate him but knew not what to say and her eloquence was only in her eyes
Twice was he called almost from the door by her eagerness to have him gone
To Catherine s simple feelings this odd sort of reserve seemed neither kindly meant nor consistently supported and its unkindness she would hardly have forborne pointing out had its inconsistency been less their friend but Anne and Maria soon set her heart at ease by the sagacity of their I know what and the evening was spent in a sort of war of wit a display of family ingenuity on one side in the mystery of an affected secret on the other of undefined discovery all equally acute
Catherine was with her friend again the next day endeavouring to support her spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the delivery of the letters a needful exertion for as the time of reasonable expectation drew near Isabella became more and more desponding and before the letter arrived had worked herself into a state of real distress
It was dear John and dear Catherine at every word dear Anne and dear Maria must immediately be made sharers in their felicity and two dears at once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child had now well earned
Catherine wished him a good journey
Without appearing to hear her he walked to the window fidgeted about hummed a tune and seemed wholly self occupied
said Catherine
replied Catherine finding that he waited for an answer
It was to Catherine the most surprising insensibility
