Elinor was hardly less anxious than herself for their removal and only so much less bent on its being effected immediately as that she was conscious of the difficulties of so long a journey which Marianne could not be brought to acknowledge
She began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good will when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer appeared to Elinor altogether much more eligible than any other
You forget said Elinor gently that its situation is not that it is not in the neighbourhood of But it is in Somersetshire
There where I looked forward to going No Elinor you can not expect me to go there
Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such feelings she only endeavoured to counteract them by working on others represented it therefore as a measure which would fix the time of her returning to that dear mother whom she so much wished to see in a more eligible more comfortable manner than any other plan could do and perhaps without any greater delay
Elinor was grateful for the attention but it could not alter her design and their mother s concurrence being readily gained every thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be and Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that were yet to divide her from Barton
Perhaps Mrs Jennings was in hopes by this vigorous sketch of their future ennui to provoke him to make that offer which might give himself an escape from it and if so she had soon afterwards good reason to think her object gained for on Elinor s moving to the window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print which she was going to copy for her friend he followed her to it with a look of particular meaning and conversed with her there for several minutes
The effect of his discourse on the lady too could not escape her observation for though she was too honorable to listen and had even changed her seat on purpose that she might _ not _ hear to one close by the piano forte on which Marianne was playing she could not keep herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour attended with agitation and was too intent on what he said to pursue her employment
Still farther in confirmation of her hopes in the interval of Marianne s turning from one lesson to another some words of the Colonel s inevitably reached her ear in which he seemed to be apologising for the badness of his house
What Elinor said in reply she could not distinguish but judged from the motion of her lips that she did not think _ that _ any material objection and Mrs Jennings commended her in her heart for being so honest
This delay on the Colonel s side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways Mrs Jennings very plainly heard Elinor say and with a voice which showed her to feel what she said I shall always think myself very much obliged to you
Elinor told him that it was
Mrs Ferrars does not know what she may be doing what she may drive her son to
Elinor s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been greater had the Colonel been really making her an offer of his hand
The preferment which only two days before she had considered as hopeless for Edward was already provided to enable him to marry and _ she _ of all people in the world was fixed on to bestow it
Her emotion was such as Mrs Jennings had attributed to a very different cause but whatever minor feelings less pure less pleasing might have a share in that emotion her esteem for the general benevolence and her gratitude for the particular friendship which together prompted Colonel Brandon to this act were strongly felt and warmly expressed
After this had been settled Colonel Brandon began to talk of his own advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour and _ then _ it was that he mentioned with regret that the house was small and indifferent an evil which Elinor as Mrs Jennings had supposed her to do made very light of at least as far as regarded its size
The smallness of the house said she I can not imagine any inconvenience to them for it will be in proportion to their family and income
By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _ she _ was considering Mr Ferrars s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation for he did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply such an income as anybody in his style of life would venture to settle on and he said so
Such was the sentence which when misunderstood so justly offended the delicate feelings of Mrs Jennings but after this narration of what really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor while they stood at the window the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting may perhaps appear in general not less reasonably excited nor less properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage
