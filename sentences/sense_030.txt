Elinor even advised her against it
But no she would go down she could bear it very well and the bustle about her would be less
Elinor pleased to have her governed for a moment by such a motive though believing it hardly possible that she could sit out the dinner said no more and adjusting her dress for her as well as she could while Marianne still remained on the bed was ready to assist her into the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it
Elinor who did justice to Mrs Jennings s kindness though its effusions were often distressing and sometimes almost ridiculous made her those acknowledgments and returned her those civilities which her sister could not make or return for herself
Had not Elinor in the sad countenance of her sister seen a check to all mirth she could have been entertained by Mrs Jennings s endeavours to cure a disappointment in love by a variety of sweetmeats and olives and a good fire
Elinor for her sister s sake could not press the subject farther and she hoped it was not required of her for Willoughby s since though Marianne might lose much he could gain very little by the enforcement of the real truth
Ay if we can do _ that _ Ma am said Elinor we shall do very well with or without Colonel Brandon
And then rising she went away to join Marianne whom she found as she expected in her own room leaning in silent misery over the small remains of a fire which till Elinor s entrance had been her only light
You had better leave me was all the notice that her sister received from her
I will leave you said Elinor if you will go to bed
But this from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering she at first refused to do
Her sister s earnest though gentle persuasion however soon softened her to compliance and Elinor saw her lay her aching head on the pillow and as she hoped in a way to get some quiet rest before she left her
In the drawing room whither she then repaired she was soon joined by Mrs Jennings with a wine glass full of something in her hand
My dear said she entering I have just recollected that I have some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was tasted so I have brought a glass of it for your sister
Dear Ma am replied Elinor smiling at the difference of the complaints for which it was recommended how good you are
Mrs Jennings though regretting that she had not been five minutes earlier was satisfied with the compromise and Elinor as she swallowed the chief of it reflected that though its effects on a colicky gout were at present of little importance to her its healing powers on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself as on her sister
Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea and by his manner of looking round the room for Marianne Elinor immediately fancied that he neither expected nor wished to see her there and in short that he was already aware of what occasioned her absence
Mrs Jennings was not struck by the same thought for soon after his entrance she walked across the room to the tea table where Elinor presided and whispered The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see
He shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers and with a look which perfectly assured her of his good information inquired after her sister
You mean answered Elinor with forced calmness Mr Willoughby s marriage with Miss Grey
