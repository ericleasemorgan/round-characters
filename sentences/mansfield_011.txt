Mrs Norris gave the particulars of the letters and the subject was dropt but after tea as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny looking out on a twilight scene while the Miss Bertrams Mr Rushworth and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the pianoforte she suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group and saying How happy Mr Rushworth looks
It is the same sort of thing said Fanny after a short pause as for the son of an admiral to go into the navy or the son of a general to be in the army and nobody sees anything wrong in that
I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny said Edmund affectionately must be beyond the reach of any sermons
