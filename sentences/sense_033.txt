She expressly conditioned however for paying no visits and would do no more than accompany them to Gray s in Sackville Street where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few old fashioned jewels of her mother
All that could be done was to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the quickest succession one gentleman only was standing there and it is probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his politeness to a quicker despatch
Elinor lost no time in bringing her business forward was on the point of concluding it when another gentleman presented himself at her side
She turned her eyes towards his face and found him with some surprise to be her brother
Elinor found that he and Fanny had been in town two days
Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her brother and was not sorry to be spared the necessity of answering him by the arrival of Mrs Jennings s servant who came to tell her that his mistress waited for them at the door
After staying with them half an hour he asked Elinor to walk with him to Conduit Street and introduce him to Sir John and Lady Middleton
He seems a most gentlemanlike man and I think Elinor I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable establishment in life
Two thousand a year and then working himself up to a pitch of enthusiastic generosity he added Elinor I wish with all my heart it were _ twice _ as much for your sake
Indeed I believe you replied Elinor but I am very sure that Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _ me _
You are mistaken Elinor you are very much mistaken
Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer
Is Mr Edward Ferrars said Elinor with resolution going to be married
Elinor could only smile
Certainly said Elinor and assisted by her liberality I hope you may yet live to be in easy circumstances
Elinor kept her concern and her censure to herself and was very thankful that Marianne was not present to share the provocation
Having now said enough to make his poverty clear and to do away the necessity of buying a pair of ear rings for each of his sisters in his next visit at Gray s his thoughts took a cheerfuller turn and he began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs Jennings
But my dear Elinor what is the matter with Marianne
I know very little of Dorsetshire but my dear Elinor I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the earliest and best pleased of your visitors
Elinor tried very seriously to convince him that there was no likelihood of her marrying Colonel Brandon but it was an expectation of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished and he was really resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman and promoting the marriage by every possible attention
