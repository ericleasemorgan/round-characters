How they were all to be conveyed he would have made a difficulty if he could but as his son and daughter s carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield he was not able to make more than a simple question on that head it hardly amounted to a doubt nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also
The evening before this great event for it was a very great event that Mr Woodhouse should dine out on the 24th of December had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold that but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs Goddard Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house
Emma called on her the next day and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls
She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat Mrs Goddard was full of care and affection Mr Perry was talked of and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement though she could not speak of her loss without many tears
Emma sat with her as long as she could to attend her in Mrs Goddard s unavoidable absences and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr Elton s would be depressed when he knew her state and left her at last tolerably comfortable in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit and of their all missing her very much
Emma was just describing the nature of her friend s complaint a throat very much inflamed with a great deal of heat about her a quick low pulse c and she was sorry to find from Mrs Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore throats and had often alarmed her with them
Emma who was not really at all frightened herself tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs Goddard s experience and care but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she could not wish to reason away which she would rather feed and assist than not she added soon afterwards as if quite another subject It is so cold so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow that if it were to any other place or with any other party I should really try not to go out to day and dissuade my father from venturing but as he has made up his mind and does not seem to feel the cold himself I do not like to interfere as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr and Mrs Weston
Mr Elton looked as if he did not very well know what answer to make which was exactly the case for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady and not liking to resist any advice of her s he had not really the least inclination to give up the visit but Emma too eager and busy in her own previous conceptions and views to hear him impartially or see him with clear vision was very well satisfied with his muttering acknowledgment of its being very cold certainly very cold and walked on rejoicing in having extricated him from Randalls and secured him the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening
Mr Elton s manners are not perfect replied Emma but where there is a wish to please one ought to overlook and one does overlook a great deal
she replied with a smile of astonishment are you imagining me to be Mr Elton s object
Such an imagination has crossed me I own Emma and if it never occurred to you before you may as well take it into consideration now
I speak as a friend Emma
Mr Elton and I are very good friends and nothing more and she walked on amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into and not very well pleased with her brother for imagining her blind and ignorant and in want of counsel
Emma soon saw that her companion was not in the happiest humour
Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent which no doubt he was in the habit of receiving to emulate the Very true my love which must have been usually administered by his travelling companion but she had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all
She could not be complying she dreaded being quarrelsome her heroism reached only to silence
She allowed him to talk and arranged the glasses and wrapped herself up without opening her lips
Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject
Mr Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness he was so very cheerful in his civilities indeed that she began to think he must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her
Emma smiled and answered My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint I hope but not even I can charm away a sore throat it is a most severe cold indeed
Mr Perry has been with her as you probably heard
Yes I imagined that is I did not He has been used to her in these complaints and I hope to morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report
She will be missed every moment
Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment
At another time Emma might have been amused but she was too much astonished now at Mr Elton s spirits for other feelings
I think you will agree with me turning with a soft air to Emma I think I shall certainly have your approbation though Mr Knightley perhaps from being used to the large parties of London may not quite enter into our feelings
