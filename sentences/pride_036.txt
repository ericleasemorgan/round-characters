36 If Elizabeth when Mr Darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents
But such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited
Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined
With amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal
With a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at Netherfield
She read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes
His belief of her sister s insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice
He expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty
But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr Wickham when she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself her feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition
Astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her
She wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming This must be false
and when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again
In this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence
The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late Mr Darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words
So far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great
What Wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err
But when she read and re read with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of Wickham s resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate
She put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartiality deliberated on the probability of each statement but with little success
Again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render Mr Darcy s conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole
The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at Mr Wickham s charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice
She had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire Militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance
As to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring
She tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of Mr Darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what Mr Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance
But no such recollection befriended her
She could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess
After pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read
Elizabeth could but just _ affect _ concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it
Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter
