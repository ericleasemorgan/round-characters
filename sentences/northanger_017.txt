16 Catherine s expectations of pleasure from her visit in Milsom Street were so very high that disappointment was inevitable and accordingly though she was most politely received by General Tilney and kindly welcomed by his daughter though Henry was at home and no one else of the party she found on her return without spending many hours in the examination of her feelings that she had gone to her appointment preparing for happiness which it had not afforded
Let me entreat you never to think of him again my dear Catherine indeed he is unworthy of you
Catherine meanwhile undisturbed by presentiments of such an evil or of any evil at all except that of having but a short set to dance down enjoyed her usual happiness with Henry Tilney listening with sparkling eyes to everything he said and in finding him irresistible becoming so herself
At the end of the first dance Captain Tilney came towards them again and much to Catherine s dissatisfaction pulled his brother away
Catherine without hesitation replied that she was very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all
Catherine blushed and disclaimed and the gentleman s predictions were verified
There was a something however in his words which repaid her for the pain of confusion and that something occupied her mind so much that she drew back for some time forgetting to speak or to listen and almost forgetting where she was till roused by the voice of Isabella she looked up and saw her with Captain Tilney preparing to give them hands across
Isabella shrugged her shoulders and smiled the only explanation of this extraordinary change which could at that time be given but as it was not quite enough for Catherine s comprehension she spoke her astonishment in very plain terms to her partner
Catherine whose expectations had been as unfixed as her ideas of her father s income and whose judgment was now entirely led by her brother felt equally well satisfied and heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly settled
There never was a young woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you and I dare say when Mr Morland sees you my dear child but do not let us distress our dear Catherine by talking of such things
Catherine was hurt by these insinuations
I am very sure said she that my father has promised to do as much as he can afford
As to that my sweet Catherine there can not be a doubt and you know me well enough to be sure that a much smaller income would satisfy me
my Catherine you have found me out
Catherine s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen
She endeavoured to believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of Isabella s regret and when she saw her at their next interview as cheerful and amiable as ever endeavoured to forget that she had for a minute thought otherwise
