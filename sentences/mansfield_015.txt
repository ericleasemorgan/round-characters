I should not have thought it the sort of play to be so easily filled up with _ us _ replied Edmund turning away to the fire where sat his mother aunt and Fanny and seating himself with a look of great vexation
The actors may be glad but the bystanders must be infinitely more thankful for a decision and I do sincerely give you joy madam as well as Mrs Norris and everybody else who is in the same predicament glancing half fearfully half slyly beyond Fanny to Edmund
She was very civilly answered by Lady Bertram but Edmund said nothing
It is not that I am afraid of learning by heart said Fanny shocked to find herself at that moment the only speaker in the room and to feel that almost every eye was upon her but I really can not act
Her entreaty had no effect on Tom he only said again what he had said before and it was not merely Tom for the requisition was now backed by Maria and Mr Crawford and Mr Yates with an urgency which differed from his but in being more gentle or more ceremonious and which altogether was quite overpowering to Fanny and before she could breathe after it Mrs Norris completed the whole by thus addressing her in a whisper at once angry and audible What a piece of work here is about nothing I am quite ashamed of you Fanny to make such a difficulty of obliging your cousins in a trifle of this sort so kind as they are to you
Edmund was too angry to speak but Miss Crawford looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs Norris and then at Fanny whose tears were beginning to shew themselves immediately said with some keenness I do not like my situation this _ place _ is too hot for me and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table close to Fanny saying to her in a kind low whisper as she placed herself Never mind my dear Miss Price this is a cross evening everybody is cross and teasing but do not let us mind them and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits in spite of being out of spirits herself
Fanny did not love Miss Crawford but she felt very much obliged to her for her present kindness and when from taking notice of her work and wishing _ she _ could work as well and begging for the pattern and supposing Fanny was now preparing for her _ appearance _ as of course she would come out when her cousin was married Miss Crawford proceeded to inquire if she had heard lately from her brother at sea and said that she had quite a curiosity to see him and imagined him a very fine young man and advised Fanny to get his picture drawn before he went to sea again she could not help admitting it to be very agreeable flattery or help listening and answering with more animation than she had intended
