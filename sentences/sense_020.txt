said she seating herself between Elinor and Marianne for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come which would be a shocking thing as we go away again tomorrow
said she in a whisper to Elinor
Elinor was not inclined after a little observation to give him credit for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill natured or ill bred as he wished to appear
Elinor could hardly keep her countenance as she assented to the hardship of such an obligation
She surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing room by asking her whether she did not like Mr Palmer excessively
Certainly said Elinor he seems very agreeable
Elinor was again obliged to decline her invitation and by changing the subject put a stop to her entreaties
She thought it probable that as they lived in the same county Mrs Palmer might be able to give some more particular account of Willoughby s general character than could be gathered from the Middletons partial acquaintance with him and she was eager to gain from any one such a confirmation of his merits as might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne
Upon my word replied Elinor you know much more of the matter than I do if you have any reason to expect such a match
said Elinor
