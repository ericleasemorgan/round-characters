Nothing occurred during the next three or four days to make Elinor regret what she had done in applying to her mother for Willoughby neither came nor wrote
After some time spent in saying little or doing less Lady Middleton sat down to Cassino and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about she and Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs placed themselves at no great distance from the table
They had not remained in this manner long before Elinor perceived Willoughby standing within a few yards of them in earnest conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman
Elinor turned involuntarily to Marianne to see whether it could be unobserved by her
At that moment she first perceived him and her whole countenance glowing with sudden delight she would have moved towards him instantly had not her sister caught hold of her
she exclaimed he is there he is there Oh
Pray pray be composed cried Elinor and do not betray what you feel to every body present
This however was more than she could believe herself and to be composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne it was beyond her wish
He approached and addressing himself rather to Elinor than Marianne as if wishing to avoid her eye and determined not to observe her attitude inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs Dashwood and asked how long they had been in town
Elinor was robbed of all presence of mind by such an address and was unable to say a word
But the feelings of her sister were instantly expressed
Her face was crimsoned over and she exclaimed in a voice of the greatest emotion Good God
He could not then avoid it but her touch seemed painful to him and he held her hand only for a moment
Elinor watched his countenance and saw its expression becoming more tranquil
Marianne now looking dreadfully white and unable to stand sunk into her chair and Elinor expecting every moment to see her faint tried to screen her from the observation of others while reviving her with lavender water
Go to him Elinor she cried as soon as she could speak and force him to come to me
In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby quit the room by the door towards the staircase and telling Marianne that he was gone urged the impossibility of speaking to him again that evening as a fresh argument for her to be calm
