23 One day only had passed since Anne s conversation with Mrs Smith but a keener interest had succeeded and she was now so little touched by Mr Elliot s conduct except by its effects in one quarter that it became a matter of course the next morning still to defer her explanatory visit in Rivers Street
Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation and yet as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars such as how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over what my brother Hayter had said one day and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next and what had occurred to my sister Hayter and what the young people had wished and what I said at first I never could consent to but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well and a great deal in the same style of open hearted communication minutiae which even with every advantage of taste and delicacy which good Mrs Musgrove could not give could be properly interesting only to the principals
Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much self occupied to hear
Anne found an unexpected interest here
She felt its application to herself felt it in a nervous thrill all over her and at the same moment that her eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table Captain Wentworth s pen ceased to move his head was raised pausing listening and he turned round the next instant to give a look one quick conscious look at her
The two ladies continued to talk to re urge the same admitted truths and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary practice as had fallen within their observation but Anne heard nothing distinctly it was only a buzz of words in her ear her mind was in confusion
Captain Harville who had in truth been hearing none of it now left his seat and moved to a window and Anne seeming to watch him though it was from thorough absence of mind became gradually sensible that he was inviting her to join him where he stood
He looked at her with a smile and a little motion of the head which expressed Come to me I have something to say and the unaffected easy kindness of manner which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he really was strongly enforced the invitation
She roused herself and went to him
As she joined him Captain Harville s countenance re assumed the serious thoughtful expression which seemed its natural character
But in a deep tone it was not done for her
No replied Anne in a low feeling voice
It was not in her nature
She doted on him
True said Anne very true I did not recollect but what shall we say now Captain Harville
Your feelings may be the strongest replied Anne but the same spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most tender
It was nothing more than that his pen had fallen down but Anne was startled at finding him nearer than she had supposed and half inclined to suspect that the pen had only fallen because he had been occupied by them striving to catch sounds which yet she did not think he could have caught
I am in very good anchorage here smiling at Anne well supplied and want for nothing
cried Anne eagerly I hope I do justice to all that is felt by you and by those who resemble you
To night we may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party turning to Anne
Anne knew not how to understand it
She had the kindest Good morning God bless you
She had only time however to move closer to the table where he had been writing when footsteps were heard returning the door opened it was himself
He begged their pardon but he had forgotten his gloves and instantly crossing the room to the writing table he drew out a letter from under the scattered paper placed it before Anne with eyes of glowing entreaty fixed on her for a time and hastily collecting his gloves was again out of the room almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware of his being in it the work of an instant
The chair was earnestly protested against and Mrs Musgrove who thought only of one sort of illness having assured herself with some anxiety that there had been no fall in the case that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down and got a blow on her head that she was perfectly convinced of having had no fall could part with her cheerfully and depend on finding her better at night
Anxious to omit no possible precaution Anne struggled and said I am afraid ma am that it is not perfectly understood
Anne could do no more but her heart prophesied some mischance to damp the perfection of her felicity
Even if he did not come to Camden Place himself it would be in her power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville
Charles in his real concern and good nature would go home with her there was no preventing him
But she could not be long ungrateful he was sacrificing an engagement at a gunsmith s to be of use to her and she set off with him with no feeling but gratitude apparent
They were on Union Street when a quicker step behind a something of familiar sound gave her two moments preparation for the sight of Captain Wentworth
Anne could command herself enough to receive that look and not repulsively
He walked by her side
Because if you are I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my place and give Anne your arm to her father s door
She is rather done for this morning and must not go so far without help and I ought to be at that fellow s in the Market Place
Anne smiled and let it pass
It is something for a woman to be assured in her eight and twentieth year that she has not lost one charm of earlier youth but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to Anne by comparing it with former words and feeling it to be the result not the cause of a revival of his warm attachment
You should have distinguished replied Anne
I should have thought said Anne that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this
At last Anne was at home again and happier than any one in that house could have conceived
All the surprise and suspense and every other painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation she re entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last
An interval of meditation serious and grateful was the best corrective of everything dangerous in such high wrought felicity and she went to her room and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her enjoyment
It was but a card party it was but a mixture of those who had never met before and those who met too often a commonplace business too numerous for intimacy too small for variety but Anne had never found an evening shorter
Glowing and lovely in sensibility and happiness and more generally admired than she thought about or cared for she had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature around her
Mr Elliot was there she avoided but she could pity him
The Wallises she had amusement in understanding them
