It was an alarming change and Emma was thinking of it one morning as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her when Mr Knightley came in and distressing thoughts were put by
After the first chat of pleasure he was silent and then in a graver tone began with I have something to tell you Emma some news
said she quickly looking up in his face
I am afraid said he composing his features I am very much afraid my dear Emma that you will not smile when you hear it
He paused a moment again smiling with his eyes fixed on her face
Emma gave a start which did not seem like being prepared and her eyes in eager gaze said No this is impossible
but her lips were closed
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement
You like it my Emma as little as I feared
You mistake me you quite mistake me she replied exerting herself
Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply
To speak she was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness
She must wait a moment or he would think her mad
Her silence disturbed him and after observing her a little while he added Emma my love you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected
His rank in society I would alter if I could which is saying a great deal I assure you Emma
He wanted her to look up and smile and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly she did cheerfully answering You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match
Emma could not help laughing as she answered Upon my word I believe you know her quite as well as I do
But Mr Knightley are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him
I could suppose she might in time but can she already
The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr Knightley and Robert Martin was at this moment so strong to Emma s feelings and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet s side so fresh the sound of those words spoken with such emphasis No I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove in some measure premature
I am perfectly satisfied replied Emma with the brightest smiles and most sincerely wish them happy
cried Emma shaking her head
Emma was extremely glad to see him but there was a degree of confusion a number of embarrassing recollections on each side
They met readily and smiling but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said and having all sat down again there was for some time such a blank in the circle that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged which she had long felt of seeing Frank Churchill once more and of seeing him with Jane would yield its proportion of pleasure
No indeed cried Emma most happy to begin not in the least
He thanked her with all his heart and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness
Is not she looking well
Emma blushed and forbade its being pronounced in her hearing
I can never think of it she cried without extreme shame
It is not now worth a regret said Emma
I have some hope resumed he of my uncle s being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls he wants to be introduced to her
When the Campbells are returned we shall meet them in London and continue there I trust till we may carry her northward
But now I am at such a distance from her is not it hard Miss Woodhouse
Emma spoke her pity so very kindly that with a sudden accession of gay thought he cried Ah
She coloured and laughed
Emma was delighted and only wanted him to go on in the same style but his mind was the next moment in his own concerns and with his own Jane and his next words were Did you ever see such a skin
I have always admired her complexion replied Emma archly but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale
When we first began to talk of her
How could I dare But he laughed so heartily at the recollection that Emma could not help saying I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time you had very great amusement in tricking us all
Very beautiful indeed replied Emma and she spoke so kindly that he gratefully burst out How delighted I am to see you again
said he to Emma and trying as he spoke to catch Miss Fairfax s eye
Emma soon recollected and understood him and while she joined in the laugh it was evident from Jane s countenance that she too was really hearing him though trying to seem deaf
He had a great deal to say in return and very entertainingly but Emma s feelings were chiefly with Jane in the argument and on leaving Randalls and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men she felt that pleased as she had been to see Frank Churchill and really regarding him as she did with friendship she had never been more sensible of Mr Knightley s high superiority of character
