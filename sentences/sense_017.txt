Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters without extending the passion to her and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself
Grandeur has but little said Elinor but wealth has much to do with it
Elinor for shame
Perhaps said Elinor smiling we may come to the same point
Elinor laughed
Elinor smiled again to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna

You must begin your improvements on this house observed Elinor and your difficulties will soon vanish
Marianne is as steadfast as ever you see said Elinor she is not at all altered
She is only grown a little more grave than she was
Nor do I think it a part of Marianne s said Elinor I should hardly call her a lively girl she is very earnest very eager in all she does sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation but she is not often really merry
I believe you are right he replied and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl
I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes said Elinor in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other fancying people so much more gay or grave or ingenious or stupid than they really are and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated
But I thought it was right Elinor said Marianne to be guided wholly by the opinion of other people
You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of general civility said Edward to Elinor Do you gain no ground
Quite the contrary replied Elinor looking expressively at Marianne
Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers said Elinor
She knows her own worth too well for false shame replied Edward
Elinor looked surprised at his emotion but trying to laugh off the subject she said to him Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means
