As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne s imprudence and want of thought surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both
Imagine to yourself my dear Elinor the delight of a gallop on some of these downs
Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair and for some time she refused to submit to them
Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little or at least so lately known to her
You are mistaken Elinor said she warmly in supposing I know very little of Willoughby
Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more
She knew her sister s temper
Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion
But by an appeal to her affection for her mother by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself if as would probably be the case she consented to this increase of establishment Marianne was shortly subdued and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next that it must be declined
