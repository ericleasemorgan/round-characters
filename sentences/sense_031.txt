Elinor encouraged her as much as possible to talk of what she felt and before breakfast was ready they had gone through the subject again and again and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on Elinor s side the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on Marianne s as before
Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her sister was often led in her opinion of others by the irritable refinement of her own mind and the too great importance placed by her on the delicacies of a strong sensibility and the graces of a polished manner
Her mother still confident of their engagement and relying as warmly as ever on his constancy had only been roused by Elinor s application to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them both and this with such tenderness towards her such affection for Willoughby and such a conviction of their future happiness in each other that she wept with agony through the whole of it
Elinor unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be in London or at Barton offered no counsel of her own except of patience till their mother s wishes could be known and at length she obtained her sister s consent to wait for that knowledge
Mrs Jennings left them earlier than usual for she could not be easy till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself and positively refusing Elinor s offered attendance went out alone for the rest of the morning
Elinor with a very heavy heart aware of the pain she was going to communicate and perceiving by Marianne s letter how ill she had succeeded in laying any foundation for it then sat down to write her mother an account of what had passed and entreat her directions for the future while Marianne who came into the drawing room on Mrs Jennings s going away remained fixed at the table where Elinor wrote watching the advancement of her pen grieving over her for the hardship of such a task and grieving still more fondly over its effect on her mother
cried Elinor
The event proved her conjecture right though it was founded on injustice and error for Colonel Brandon _ did _ come in and Elinor who was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him thither and who saw _ that _ solicitude in his disturbed and melancholy look and in his anxious though brief inquiry after her could not forgive her sister for esteeming him so lightly
I understand you said Elinor
Indeed answered Elinor I have _ not _ forgotten it
Elinor affected by his relation and still more by his distress could not speak
He saw her concern and coming to her took her hand pressed it and kissed it with grateful respect
My first care when I _ did _ arrive was of course to seek for her but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy
I could not trace her beyond her first seducer and there was every reason to fear that she had removed from him only to sink deeper in a life of sin
Her legal allowance was not adequate to her fortune nor sufficient for her comfortable maintenance and I learnt from my brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months before to another person
He imagined and calmly could he imagine it that her extravagance and consequent distress had obliged her to dispose of it for some immediate relief
At last however and after I had been six months in England I _ did _ find her
Again he stopped to recover himself and Elinor spoke her feelings in an exclamation of tender concern at the fate of his unfortunate friend
cried Elinor could it be could Willoughby
The first news that reached me of her he continued came in a letter from herself last October
exclaimed Elinor
Elinor s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness attended too with the assurance of her expecting material advantage to Marianne from the communication of what had passed
I have been more pained said she by her endeavors to acquit him than by all the rest for it irritates her mind more than the most perfect conviction of his unworthiness can do
Now though at first she will suffer much I am sure she will soon become easier
Have you she continued after a short silence ever seen Mr Willoughby since you left him at Barton
Elinor startled by his manner looked at him anxiously saying What
Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this but to a man and a soldier she presumed not to censure it
Recollecting soon afterwards that he was probably dividing Elinor from her sister he put an end to his visit receiving from her again the same grateful acknowledgments and leaving her full of compassion and esteem for him
