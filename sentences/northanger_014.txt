The affair thus determined and Thorpe s approbation secured Catherine only remained to be apprised of it
She had left them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney
In that interval the plan was completed and as soon as she came again her agreement was demanded but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella Catherine looked grave was very sorry but could not go
The engagement which ought to have kept her from joining in the former attempt would make it impossible for her to accompany them now
She had that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk tomorrow it was quite determined and she would not upon any account retract
Catherine was distressed but not subdued
She was sure her dearest sweetest Catherine would not seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her so dearly
She knew her beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart so sweet a temper to be so easily persuaded by those she loved
But all in vain Catherine felt herself to be in the right and though pained by such tender such flattering supplication could not allow it to influence her
I can not help being jealous Catherine when I see myself slighted for strangers I who love you so excessively
Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind
Was it the part of a friend thus to expose her feelings to the notice of others
Isabella in the meanwhile had applied her handkerchief to her eyes and Morland miserable at such a sight could not help saying Nay Catherine
This was the first time of her brother s openly siding against her and anxious to avoid his displeasure she proposed a compromise
If they would only put off their scheme till Tuesday which they might easily do as it depended only on themselves she could go with them and everybody might then be satisfied
Catherine was sorry but could do no more and a short silence ensued which was broken by Isabella who in a voice of cold resentment said Very well then there is an end of the party
If Catherine does not go I can not
Catherine you must go said James
The three others still continued together walking in a most uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine sometimes not a word was said sometimes she was again attacked with supplications or reproaches and her arm was still linked within Isabella s though their hearts were at war
I did not think you had been so obstinate Catherine said James you were not used to be so hard to persuade you once were the kindest best tempered of my sisters
I hope I am not less so now she replied very feelingly but indeed I can not go
Catherine s heart swelled she drew away her arm and Isabella made no opposition
cried Catherine
Left her this moment
Told her you had sent me to say that having just recollected a prior engagement of going to Clifton with us tomorrow you could not have the pleasure of walking with her till Tuesday
She said very well Tuesday was just as convenient to her so there is an end of all our difficulties
Now my sweet Catherine all our distresses are over you are honourably acquitted and we shall have a most delightful party
This will not do said Catherine I can not submit to this
Then I will go after them said Catherine wherever they are I will go after them
And with these words she broke away and hurried off
Away walked Catherine in great agitation as fast as the crowd would permit her fearful of being pursued yet determined to persevere
As she walked she reflected on what had passed
It was painful to her to disappoint and displease them particularly to displease her brother but she could not repent her resistance
Setting her own inclination apart to have failed a second time in her engagement to Miss Tilney to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before and on a false pretence too must have been wrong
Catherine found that John Thorpe _ had _ given the message and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself greatly surprised by it
But whether her brother had still exceeded her in resentment Catherine though she instinctively addressed herself as much to one as to the other in her vindication had no means of knowing
Whatever might have been felt before her arrival her eager declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as she could desire
The affair thus happily settled she was introduced by Miss Tilney to her father and received by him with such ready such solicitous politeness as recalled Thorpe s information to her mind and made her think with pleasure that he might be sometimes depended on
And if Catherine had not most warmly asserted his innocence it seemed likely that William would lose the favour of his master forever if not his place by her rapidity
After sitting with them a quarter of an hour she rose to take leave and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney s asking her if she would do his daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of the day with her
Catherine was greatly obliged but it was quite out of her power
Oh no Catherine was sure they would not have the least objection and she should have great pleasure in coming
The general attended her himself to the street door saying everything gallant as they went downstairs admiring the elasticity of her walk which corresponded exactly with the spirit of her dancing and making her one of the most graceful bows she had ever beheld when they parted
Catherine delighted by all that had passed proceeded gaily to Pulteney Street walking as she concluded with great elasticity though she had never thought of it before
She reached home without seeing anything more of the offended party and now that she had been triumphant throughout had carried her point and was secure of her walk she began as the flutter of her spirits subsided to doubt whether she had been perfectly right
A sacrifice was always noble and if she had given way to their entreaties she should have been spared the distressing idea of a friend displeased a brother angry and a scheme of great happiness to both destroyed perhaps through her means
To ease her mind and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced person what her own conduct had really been she took occasion to mention before Mr Allen the half settled scheme of her brother and the Thorpes for the following day
Dear madam cried Catherine then why did not you tell me so before
Catherine relieved for herself felt uneasy for Isabella and after a moment s thought asked Mr Allen whether it would not be both proper and kind in her to write to Miss Thorpe and explain the indecorum of which she must be as insensible as herself for she considered that Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day in spite of what had passed
Catherine submitted and though sorry to think that Isabella should be doing wrong felt greatly relieved by Mr Allen s approbation of her own conduct and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his advice from the danger of falling into such an error herself
