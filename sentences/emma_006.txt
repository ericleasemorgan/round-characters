VI Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet s fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr Elton s being a remarkably handsome man with most agreeable manners and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet s side as there could be any occasion for
No sooner was she out of sight than Emma exclaimed What an exquisite possession a good picture of her would be
I almost long to attempt her likeness myself
thought Emma but what has all that to do with taking likenesses
Emma wished to go to work directly and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits for not one of them had ever been finished that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet
No great variety of faces for you said Emma
No husbands and wives with so interesting a consciousness that Emma began to consider whether she had not better leave them together at once
But as she wanted to be drawing the declaration must wait a little longer
She had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait
It was to be a whole length in water colours like Mr John Knightley s and was destined if she could please herself to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece
Harriet listened and Emma drew in peace
She must allow him to be still frequently coming to look any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover and he was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil to jump up and see the progress and be charmed
She could not respect his eye but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable
The sitting was altogether very satisfactory she was quite enough pleased with the first day s sketch to wish to go on
There was no want of likeness she had been fortunate in the attitude and as she meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure to give a little more height and considerably more elegance she had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a standing memorial of the beauty of one the skill of the other and the friendship of both with as many other agreeable associations as Mr Elton s very promising attachment was likely to add
You have made her too tall Emma said Mr Knightley
Emma knew that she had but would not own it and Mr Elton warmly added Oh no
Consider she is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved you know
Mr Elton was to take the drawing to London chuse the frame and give the directions and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough
This man is almost too gallant to be in love thought Emma
