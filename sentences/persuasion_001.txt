Walter Elliot born March 1 1760 married July 15 1784 Elizabeth daughter of James Stevenson Esq of South Park in the county of Gloucester by which lady who died 1800 he has issue Elizabeth born June 1 1785 Anne born August 9 1787 a still born son November 5 1789 Mary born November 20 1791
Mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove but Anne with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding was nobody with either father or sister her word had no weight her convenience was always to give way she was only Anne
Lady Russell loved them all but it was only in Anne that she could fancy the mother to revive again
and Elizabeth to do her justice had in the first ardour of female alarm set seriously to think what could be done and had finally proposed these two branches of economy to cut off some unnecessary charities and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing room to which expedients she afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no present down to Anne as had been the usual yearly custom
But these measures however good in themselves were insufficient for the real extent of the evil the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged to confess to her soon afterwards
