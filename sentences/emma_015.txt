Mrs Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa
Emma in good spirits too from the amusement afforded her mind by the expectation of Mr Frank Churchill was willing to forget his late improprieties and be as well satisfied with him as before and on his making Harriet his very first subject was ready to listen with most friendly smiles
And in this style he talked on for some time very properly not much attending to any answer but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat and Emma was quite in charity with him
But at last there seemed a perverse turn it seemed all at once as if he were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her account than on Harriet s more anxious that she should escape the infection than that there should be no infection in the complaint
Emma saw Mrs Weston s surprize and felt that it must be great at an address which in words and manner was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her and as for herself she was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose
She could only give him a look but it was such a look as she thought must restore him to his senses and then left the sofa removing to a seat by her sister and giving her all her attention
She had not time to know how Mr Elton took the reproof so rapidly did another subject succeed for Mr John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow and of its still snowing fast with a strong drifting wind concluding with these words to Mr Woodhouse This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements sir
Mrs Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him and turn his attention from his son in law who was pursuing his triumph rather unfeelingly
What is to be done my dear Emma
To her he looked for comfort and her assurances of safety her representation of the excellence of the horses and of James and of their having so many friends about them revived him a little
The horror of being blocked up at Randalls while her children were at Hartfield was full in her imagination and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people but in a state that admitted no delay she was eager to have it settled that her father and Emma should remain at Randalls while she and her husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them
Isabella then went to Emma but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away and they were still discussing the point when Mr Knightley who had left the room immediately after his brother s first report of the snow came back again and told them that he had been out of doors to examine and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home whenever they liked it either now or an hour hence
To Isabella the relief of such tidings was very great and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her father s account who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his nervous constitution allowed but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him while he continued at Randalls
He was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home but no assurances could convince him that it was safe to stay and while the others were variously urging and recommending Mr Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences thus Your father will not be easy why do not you go
A few minutes more and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his own house to get sober and cool and the other recover his temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over
And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind
Isabella stept in after her father John Knightley forgetting that he did not belong to their party stept in after his wife very naturally so that Emma found on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr Elton that the door was to be lawfully shut on them and that they were to have a t te t te drive
It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment it would have been rather a pleasure previous to the suspicions of this very day she could have talked to him of Harriet and the three quarters of a mile would have seemed but one
But now she would rather it had not happened
She believed he had been drinking too much of Mr Weston s good wine and felt sure that he would want to be talking nonsense
To restrain him as much as might be by her own manners she was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night but scarcely had she begun scarcely had they passed the sweep gate and joined the other carriage than she found her subject cut up her hand seized her attention demanded and Mr Elton actually making violent love to her availing himself of the precious opportunity declaring sentiments which must be already well known hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she refused him but flattering himself that his ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect and in short very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible
It would be impossible to say what Emma felt on hearing this which of all her unpleasant sensations was uppermost
She was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr Elton s sanguine state of mind he tried to take her hand again as he joyously exclaimed Charming Miss Woodhouse
No sir cried Emma it confesses no such thing
Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him a good night
The compliment was just returned coldly and proudly and under indescribable irritation of spirits she was then conveyed to Hartfield
