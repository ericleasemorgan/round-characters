The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford s the truth or at least the strength of her indifference might well be questionable and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him in the professions of persevering assiduous and not desponding attachment which closed the interview
It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself
Now she was angry
Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her
Here was again a something of the same Mr Crawford whom she had so reprobated before
Had her own affections been as free as perhaps they ought to have been he never could have engaged them
Mr Crawford s steadiness was honoured and Fanny was praised and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world
Indeed sir said Fanny I am very sorry that Mr Crawford should continue to I know that it is paying me a very great compliment and I feel most undeservedly honoured but I am so perfectly convinced and I have told him so that it never will be in my power My dear interrupted Sir Thomas there is no occasion for this
The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much satisfaction
Her uncle s kind expressions however and forbearing manner were sensibly felt and when she considered how much of the truth was unknown to him she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued
By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty which she had been doubting about before and that she would be advantageously married it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece
Well Fanny said she as soon as they were alone together afterwards and she really had known something like impatience to be alone with her and her countenance as she spoke had extraordinary animation Well Fanny I have had a very agreeable surprise this morning
And you must be aware Fanny that it is every young woman s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this
I will tell you what Fanny said she I am sure he fell in love with you at the ball I am sure the mischief was done that evening
And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts she soon afterwards added And I will tell you what Fanny which is more than I did for Maria the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy
