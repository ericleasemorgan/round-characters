40 Elizabeth s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between Mr Darcy and herself
Miss Bennet s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings
She was sorry that Mr Darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sister s refusal must have given him
His being so sure of succeeding was wrong said she and certainly ought not to have appeared but consider how much it must increase his disappointment
Indeed replied Elizabeth I am heartily sorry for him but he has other feelings which will probably soon drive away his regard for me
She then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned George Wickham
This will not do said Elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything
The tumult of Elizabeth s mind was allayed by this conversation
She had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in Jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either
But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such expectation she made no answer
