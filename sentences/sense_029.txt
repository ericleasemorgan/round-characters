In this situation Elinor roused from sleep by her agitation and sobs first perceived her and after observing her for a few moments with silent anxiety said in a tone of the most considerate gentleness Marianne may I ask
No Elinor she replied ask nothing you will soon know all
The sort of desperate calmness with which this was said lasted no longer than while she spoke and was immediately followed by a return of the same excessive affliction
It was some minutes before she could go on with her letter and the frequent bursts of grief which still obliged her at intervals to withhold her pen were proofs enough of her feeling how more than probable it was that she was writing for the last time to Willoughby
Elinor paid her every quiet and unobtrusive attention in her power and she would have tried to sooth and tranquilize her still more had not Marianne entreated her with all the eagerness of the most nervous irritability not to speak to her for the world
At breakfast she neither ate nor attempted to eat any thing and Elinor s attention was then all employed not in urging her not in pitying her nor in appearing to regard her but in endeavouring to engage Mrs Jennings s notice entirely to herself
Elinor who saw as plainly by this as if she had seen the direction that it must come from Willoughby felt immediately such a sickness at heart as made her hardly able to hold up her head and sat in such a general tremour as made her fear it impossible to escape Mrs Jennings s notice
Of Elinor s distress she was too busily employed in measuring lengths of worsted for her rug to see any thing at all and calmly continuing her talk as soon as Marianne disappeared she said Upon my word I never saw a young woman so desperately in love in my life
I hope from the bottom of my heart he wo n t keep her waiting much longer for it is quite grievous to see her look so ill and forlorn
Elinor though never less disposed to speak than at that moment obliged herself to answer such an attack as this and therefore trying to smile replied And have you really Ma am talked yourself into a persuasion of my sister s being engaged to Mr Willoughby
Indeed Ma am said Elinor very seriously you are mistaken
Mrs Jennings laughed again but Elinor had not spirits to say more and eager at all events to know what Willoughby had written hurried away to their room where on opening the door she saw Marianne stretched on the bed almost choked by grief one letter in her hand and two or three others lying by her
Elinor drew near but without saying a word and seating herself on the bed took her hand kissed her affectionately several times and then gave way to a burst of tears which at first was scarcely less violent than Marianne s
The latter though unable to speak seemed to feel all the tenderness of this behaviour and after some time thus spent in joint affliction she put all the letters into Elinor s hands and then covering her face with her handkerchief almost screamed with agony
Elinor who knew that such grief shocking as it was to witness it must have its course watched by her till this excess of suffering had somewhat spent itself and then turning eagerly to Willoughby s letter read as follows Bond Street January
In her earnest meditations on the contents of the letter on the depravity of that mind which could dictate it and probably on the very different mind of a very different person who had no other connection whatever with the affair than what her heart gave him with every thing that passed Elinor forgot the immediate distress of her sister forgot that she had three letters on her lap yet unread and so entirely forgot how long she had been in the room that when on hearing a carriage drive up to the door she went to the window to see who could be coming so unreasonably early she was all astonishment to perceive Mrs Jennings s chariot which she knew had not been ordered till one
Mrs Jennings with a thoroughly good humoured concern for its cause admitted the excuse most readily and Elinor after seeing her safe off returned to Marianne whom she found attempting to rise from the bed and whom she reached just in time to prevent her from falling on the floor faint and giddy from a long want of proper rest and food for it was many days since she had any appetite and many nights since she had really slept and now when her mind was no longer supported by the fever of suspense the consequence of all this was felt in an aching head a weakened stomach and a general nervous faintness
A glass of wine which Elinor procured for her directly made her more comfortable and she was at last able to express some sense of her kindness by saying Poor Elinor
Elinor I am miserable indeed before her voice was entirely lost in sobs
Elinor could no longer witness this torrent of unresisted grief in silence
Happy happy Elinor _ you _ can not have an idea of what I suffer
Many many circumstances said Elinor solemnly
Elinor said no more and turning again to the three letters which now raised a much stronger curiosity than before directly ran over the contents of all
The first which was what her sister had sent him on their arrival in town was to this effect
M D That such letters so full of affection and confidence could have been so answered Elinor for Willoughby s sake would have been unwilling to believe
But her condemnation of him did not blind her to the impropriety of their having been written at all and she was silently grieving over the imprudence which had hazarded such unsolicited proofs of tenderness not warranted by anything preceding and most severely condemned by the event when Marianne perceiving that she had finished the letters observed to her that they contained nothing but what any one would have written in the same situation
I can believe it said Elinor but unfortunately he did not feel the same
He _ did _ feel the same Elinor for weeks and weeks he felt it
For a moment or two she could say no more but when this emotion had passed away she added in a firmer tone Elinor I have been cruelly used but not by Willoughby
Elinor would not contend and only replied Whoever may have been so detestably your enemy let them be cheated of their malignant triumph my dear sister by seeing how nobly the consciousness of your own innocence and good intentions supports your spirits
Elinor Elinor they who suffer little may be proud and independent as they like may resist insult or return mortification but I can not
Elinor was employed in walking thoughtfully from the fire to the window from the window to the fire without knowing that she received warmth from one or discerning objects through the other and Marianne seated at the foot of the bed with her head leaning against one of its posts again took up Willoughby s letter and after shuddering over every sentence exclaimed It is too much
Elinor nothing can
Elinor can he be justified
Elinor I must go home
Elinor advised her to lie down again and for a moment she did so but no attitude could give her ease and in restless pain of mind and body she moved from one posture to another till growing more and more hysterical her sister could with difficulty keep her on the bed at all and for some time was fearful of being constrained to call for assistance
Some lavender drops however which she was at length persuaded to take were of use and from that time till Mrs Jennings returned she continued on the bed quiet and motionless
