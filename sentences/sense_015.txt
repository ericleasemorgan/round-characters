Elinor felt equal amazement
Elinor s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother s
She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust
Willoughby s behaviour in taking leave of them his embarrassment and affectation of cheerfulness and above all his unwillingness to accept her mother s invitation a backwardness so unlike a lover so unlike himself greatly disturbed her
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for though when she considered what Marianne s love for him was a quarrel seemed almost impossible
Our dear Willoughby is now some miles from Barton Elinor said she as she sat down to work and with how heavy a heart does he travel
It was not inclination that he wanted Elinor I could plainly see _ that _
I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way but you Elinor who love to doubt where you can it will not satisfy _ you _ I know but you shall not talk _ me _ out of my trust in it
And now Elinor what have you to say
Oh Elinor how incomprehensible are your feelings
I want no proof of their affection said Elinor but of their engagement I do
My Elinor is it possible to doubt their engagement
I confess replied Elinor that every circumstance except _ one _ is in favour of their engagement but that _ one _ is the total silence of both on the subject and with me it almost outweighs every other
I hope not I believe not cried Elinor
They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother to acknowledge the probability of many and hope for the justice of all
