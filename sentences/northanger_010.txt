9 The progress of Catherine s unhappiness from the events of the evening was as follows
It appeared first in a general dissatisfaction with everybody about her while she remained in the rooms which speedily brought on considerable weariness and a violent desire to go home
This on arriving in Pulteney Street took the direction of extraordinary hunger and when that was appeased changed into an earnest longing to be in bed such was the extreme point of her distress for when there she immediately fell into a sound sleep which lasted nine hours and from which she awoke perfectly revived in excellent spirits with fresh hopes and fresh schemes
The first wish of her heart was to improve her acquaintance with Miss Tilney and almost her first resolution to seek her for that purpose in the pump room at noon
In the pump room one so newly arrived in Bath must be met with and that building she had already found so favourable for the discovery of female excellence and the completion of female intimacy so admirably adapted for secret discourses and unlimited confidence that she was most reasonably encouraged to expect another friend from within its walls
Her plan for the morning thus settled she sat quietly down to her book after breakfast resolving to remain in the same place and the same employment till the clock struck one and from habitude very little incommoded by the remarks and ejaculations of Mrs Allen whose vacancy of mind and incapacity for thinking were such that as she never talked a great deal so she could never be entirely silent and therefore while she sat at her work if she lost her needle or broke her thread if she heard a carriage in the street or saw a speck upon her gown she must observe it aloud whether there were anyone at leisure to answer her or not
At about half past twelve a remarkably loud rap drew her in haste to the window and scarcely had she time to inform Catherine of there being two open carriages at the door in the first only a servant her brother driving Miss Thorpe in the second before John Thorpe came running upstairs calling out Well Miss Morland here I am
said Catherine
Something was said about it I remember said Catherine looking at Mrs Allen for her opinion but really I did not expect you
Catherine s silent appeal to her friend meanwhile was entirely thrown away for Mrs Allen not being at all in the habit of conveying any expression herself by a look was not aware of its being ever intended by anybody else and Catherine whose desire of seeing Miss Tilney again could at that moment bear a short delay in favour of a drive and who thought there could be no impropriety in her going with Mr Thorpe as Isabella was going at the same time with James was therefore obliged to speak plainer
Catherine took the advice and ran off to get ready
In a very few minutes she reappeared having scarcely allowed the two others time enough to get through a few short sentences in her praise after Thorpe had procured Mrs Allen s admiration of his gig and then receiving her friend s parting good wishes they both hurried downstairs
Catherine followed her orders and turned away but not too soon to hear her friend exclaim aloud to James What a sweet girl she is
I quite dote on her
Catherine did not think the portrait a very inviting one but it was too late to retreat and she was too young to own herself frightened so resigning herself to her fate and trusting to the animal s boasted knowledge of its owner she sat peaceably down and saw Thorpe sit down by her
Catherine delighted at so happy an escape spoke her pleasure aloud with grateful surprise and her companion immediately made the matter perfectly simple by assuring her that it was entirely owing to the peculiarly judicious manner in which he had then held the reins and the singular discernment and dexterity with which he had directed his whip
Catherine though she could not help wondering that with such perfect command of his horse he should think it necessary to alarm her with a relation of its tricks congratulated herself sincerely on being under the care of so excellent a coachman and perceiving that the animal continued to go on in the same quiet manner without showing the smallest propensity towards any unpleasant vivacity and considering its inevitable pace was ten miles an hour by no means alarmingly fast gave herself up to all the enjoyment of air and exercise of the most invigorating kind in a fine mild day of February with the consciousness of safety
Catherine did not understand him and he repeated his question adding in explanation Old Allen the man you are with
Yes it does give a notion said Catherine warmly and that is that you all drink a great deal more wine than I thought you did
This declaration brought on a loud and overpowering reply of which no part was very distinct except the frequent exclamations amounting almost to oaths which adorned it and Catherine was left when it ended with rather a strengthened belief of there being a great deal of wine drunk in Oxford and the same happy conviction of her brother s comparative sobriety
Thorpe s ideas then all reverted to the merits of his own equipage and she was called on to admire the spirit and freedom with which his horse moved along and the ease which his paces as well as the excellence of the springs gave the motion of the carriage
She followed him in all his admiration as well as she could
His knowledge and her ignorance of the subject his rapidity of expression and her diffidence of herself put that out of her power she could strike out nothing new in commendation but she readily echoed whatever he chose to assert and it was finally settled between them without any difficulty that his equipage was altogether the most complete of its kind in England his carriage the neatest his horse the best goer and himself the best coachman
You do not really think Mr Thorpe said Catherine venturing after some time to consider the matter as entirely decided and to offer some little variation on the subject that James s gig will break down
cried Catherine quite frightened
Catherine listened with astonishment she knew not how to reconcile two such very different accounts of the same thing for she had not been brought up to understand the propensities of a rattle nor to know to how many idle assertions and impudent falsehoods the excess of vanity will lead
Her own family were plain matter of fact people who seldom aimed at wit of any kind her father at the utmost being contented with a pun and her mother with a proverb they were not in the habit therefore of telling lies to increase their importance or of asserting at one moment what they would contradict the next
She reflected on the affair for some time in much perplexity and was more than once on the point of requesting from Mr Thorpe a clearer insight into his real opinion on the subject but she checked herself because it appeared to her that he did not excel in giving those clearer insights in making those things plain which he had before made ambiguous and joining to this the consideration that he would not really suffer his sister and his friend to be exposed to a danger from which he might easily preserve them she concluded at last that he must know the carriage to be in fact perfectly safe and therefore would alarm herself no longer
Little as Catherine was in the habit of judging for herself and unfixed as were her general notions of what men ought to be she could not entirely repress a doubt while she bore with the effusions of his endless conceit of his being altogether completely agreeable
And she would neither believe her own watch nor her brother s nor the servant s she would believe no assurance of it founded on reason or reality till Morland produced his watch and ascertained the fact to have doubted a moment longer _ then _ would have been equally inconceivable incredible and impossible and she could only protest over and over again that no two hours and a half had ever gone off so swiftly before as Catherine was called on to confirm Catherine could not tell a falsehood even to please Isabella but the latter was spared the misery of her friend s dissenting voice by not waiting for her answer
It was ages since she had had a moment s conversation with her dearest Catherine and though she had such thousands of things to say to her it appeared as if they were never to be together again so with smiles of most exquisite misery and the laughing eye of utter despondency she bade her friend adieu and went on
Catherine found Mrs Allen just returned from all the busy idleness of the morning and was immediately greeted with Well my dear here you are a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute and I hope you have had a pleasant airing
Catherine inquired no further she had heard enough to feel that Mrs Allen had no real intelligence to give and that she was most particularly unfortunate herself in having missed such a meeting with both brother and sister
