43 Elizabeth as they drove along watched for the first appearance of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation and when at length they turned in at the lodge her spirits were in a high flutter
Elizabeth s mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view
Elizabeth was delighted
She had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste
They were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something
They descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned
She dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken
On applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and Elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was
The housekeeper came a respectable looking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her
They followed her into the dining parlour
Elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect
Every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight
The rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but Elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of Rosings
And of this place thought she I might have been mistress
How rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day
Her aunt now called her to look at a picture
She approached and saw the likeness of Mr Wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece
Her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it
Mrs Gardiner looked at her niece with a smile but Elizabeth could not return it
Mrs Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this intimation of her knowing her master
Elizabeth coloured and said A little
This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr Wickham s being among them
Except thought Elizabeth when she goes to Ramsgate
Elizabeth could not help saying It is very much to his credit I am sure that you should think so
Elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added I have never known a cross word from him in my life and I have known him ever since he was four years old
This was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas
That he was not a good tempered man had been her firmest opinion
Her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying There are very few people of whom so much can be said
Elizabeth almost stared at her
thought she
Elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more
thought Elizabeth
This fine account of him whispered her aunt as they walked is not quite consistent with his behaviour to our poor friend
He is certainly a good brother said Elizabeth as she walked towards one of the windows
In the former were many good paintings but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of Miss Darcy s in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible
Elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her
At last it arrested her and she beheld a striking resemblance to Mr Darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her
She stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery
There was certainly at this moment in Elizabeth s mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance
As they walked across the hall towards the river Elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables
He absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to Elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility
She had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome
The others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but Elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence
She was overpowered by shame and vexation
Her coming there was the most unfortunate the most ill judged thing in the world
It might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again
why did she come
She blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting
That he should even speak to her was amazing
but to speak with such civility to enquire after her family
Never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting
What a contrast did it offer to his last address in Rosings Park when he put his letter into her hand
She knew not what to think or how to account for it
They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene
Her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House whichever it might be where Mr Darcy then was
She longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mind in what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him
Whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure
At length however the remarks of her companions on her absence of mind aroused her and she felt the necessity of appearing more like herself
Elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house Mrs Gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible
Whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and Elizabeth s astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of Mr Darcy approaching them and at no great distance
Elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them
For a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path
With a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of Pemberley from her might be mischievously construed
Her colour changed and she said no more
Elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph
It was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush
She listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners
The conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard Mr Darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport
Mrs Gardiner who was walking arm in arm with Elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder
Elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself
Her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating Why is he so altered
It originated in Mrs Gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found Elizabeth s arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husband s
Mr Darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together
Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow
Her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when Mr Bingley s name had been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion _ his _ mind was not very differently engaged
Elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased
His wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind
Mr Darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off Elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house
The observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected
He is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle
There _ is _ something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming
His acquaintance with Elizabeth was very trifling
Elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in Kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
But perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle
Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing
Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to Wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in Kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor Wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in Hertfordshire
In confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on
The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of Mr Darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
