57 The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw Elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly
but from what the report of their engagement could originate Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that _ his _ being the intimate friend of Bingley and _ her _ being the sister of Jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea
She had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together
And her neighbours at Lucas Lodge therefore for through their communication with the Collinses the report she concluded had reached Lady Catherine had only set _ that _ down as almost certain and immediate which _ she _ had looked forward to as possible at some future time
From what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to Elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce
She knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than _ she _ could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with _ one _ whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side
With his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning
The surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs Bennet s curiosity and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject
The next morning as she was going downstairs she was met by her father who came out of his library with a letter in his hand
The colour now rushed into Elizabeth s cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued You look conscious
Your daughter Elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of Bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land
Yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin Elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentleman s proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of
Elizabeth tried to join in her father s pleasantry but could only force one most reluctant smile
Never had his wit been directed in a manner so little agreeable to her
After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match
I thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned
cried Elizabeth I am excessively diverted
Elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not
It was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried
Her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of Mr Darcy s indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too _ little _ she might have fancied too _ much _
