was uttered at the same moment by Catherine and on catching the young men s eyes the horse was immediately checked with a violence which almost threw him on his haunches and the servant having now scampered up the gentlemen jumped out and the equipage was delivered to his care
Catherine by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected received her brother with the liveliest pleasure and he being of a very amiable disposition and sincerely attached to her gave every proof on his side of equal satisfaction which he could have leisure to do while the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his notice and to her his devoirs were speedily paid with a mixture of joy and embarrassment which might have informed Catherine had she been more expert in the development of other people s feelings and less simply engrossed by her own that her brother thought her friend quite as pretty as she could do herself
John Thorpe who in the meantime had been giving orders about the horses soon joined them and from him she directly received the amends which were her due for while he slightly and carelessly touched the hand of Isabella on her he bestowed a whole scrape and half a short bow
And I am sure said Catherine I know so little of such things that I can not judge whether it was cheap or dear
That was very good natured of you said Catherine quite pleased
John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine and after a few minutes silence renewed the conversation about his gig
Thank you said Catherine in some distress from a doubt of the propriety of accepting such an offer
said Catherine very seriously
My dearest Catherine I quite envy you but I am afraid brother you will not have room for a third
This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two but Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result
Her companion s discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of every woman they met and Catherine after listening and agreeing as long as she could with all the civility and deference of the youthful female mind fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition to that of a self assured man especially where the beauty of her own sex is concerned ventured at length to vary the subject by a question which had been long uppermost in her thoughts it was Have you ever read Udolpho Mr Thorpe
Catherine humbled and ashamed was going to apologize for her question but he prevented her by saying Novels are all so full of nonsense and stuff there has not been a tolerably decent one come out since Tom Jones except The Monk I read that t other day but as for all the others they are the stupidest things in creation
Udolpho was written by Mrs Radcliffe said Catherine with some hesitation from the fear of mortifying him
This critique the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor Catherine brought them to the door of Mrs Thorpe s lodgings and the feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son as they met Mrs Thorpe who had descried them from above in the passage
These manners did not please Catherine but he was James s friend and Isabella s brother and her judgment was further bought off by Isabella s assuring her when they withdrew to see the new hat that John thought her the most charming girl in the world and by John s engaging her before they parted to dance with him that evening
Had she been older or vainer such attacks might have done little but where youth and diffidence are united it requires uncommon steadiness of reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl in the world and of being so very early engaged as a partner and the consequence was that when the two Morlands after sitting an hour with the Thorpes set off to walk together to Mr Allen s and James as the door was closed on them said Well Catherine how do you like my friend Thorpe
instead of answering as she probably would have done had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case I do not like him at all she directly replied I like him very much he seems very agreeable
She said the highest things in your praise that could possibly be and the praise of such a girl as Miss Thorpe even you Catherine taking her hand with affection may be proud of
I need not ask you whether you are happy here my dear Catherine with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe it would be impossible for you to be otherwise and the Allens I am sure are very kind to you
James accepted this tribute of gratitude and qualified his conscience for accepting it too by saying with perfect sincerity Indeed Catherine I love you dearly
The time of the two parties uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted Catherine was then left to the luxury of a raised restless and frightened imagination over the pages of Udolpho lost from all worldly concerns of dressing and dinner incapable of soothing Mrs Allen s fears on the delay of an expected dressmaker and having only one minute in sixty to bestow even on the reflection of her own felicity in being already engaged for the evening
