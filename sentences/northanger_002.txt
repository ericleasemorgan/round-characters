A thousand alarming presentiments of evil to her beloved Catherine from this terrific separation must oppress her heart with sadness and drown her in tears for the last day or two of their being together and advice of the most important and applicable nature must of course flow from her wise lips in their parting conference in her closet
I beg Catherine you will always wrap yourself up very warm about the throat when you come from the rooms at night and I wish you would try to keep some account of the money you spend I will give you this little book on purpose
It is remarkable however that she neither insisted on Catherine s writing by every post nor exacted her promise of transmitting the character of every new acquaintance nor a detail of every interesting conversation that Bath might produce
Catherine was all eager delight her eyes were here there everywhere as they approached its fine and striking environs and afterwards drove through those streets which conducted them to the hotel
She was come to be happy and she felt happy already
It is now expedient to give some description of Mrs Allen that the reader may be able to judge in what manner her actions will hereafter tend to promote the general distress of the work and how she will probably contribute to reduce poor Catherine to all the desperate wretchedness of which a last volume is capable whether by her imprudence vulgarity or jealousy whether by intercepting her letters ruining her character or turning her out of doors
Catherine too made some purchases herself and when all these matters were arranged the important evening came which was to usher her into the Upper Rooms
Her hair was cut and dressed by the best hand her clothes put on with care and both Mrs Allen and her maid declared she looked quite as she should do
With such encouragement Catherine hoped at least to pass uncensured through the crowd
As for admiration it was always very welcome when it came but she did not depend on it
With more care for the safety of her new gown than for the comfort of her protegee Mrs Allen made her way through the throng of men by the door as swiftly as the necessary caution would allow Catherine however kept close at her side and linked her arm too firmly within her friend s to be torn asunder by any common effort of a struggling assembly
But to her utter amazement she found that to proceed along the room was by no means the way to disengage themselves from the crowd it seemed rather to increase as they went on whereas she had imagined that when once fairly within the door they should easily find seats and be able to watch the dances with perfect convenience
For some time her young friend felt obliged to her for these wishes but they were repeated so often and proved so totally ineffectual that Catherine grew tired at last and would thank her no more
Catherine began to feel something of disappointment she was tired of being continually pressed against by people the generality of whose faces possessed nothing to interest and with all of whom she was so wholly unacquainted that she could not relieve the irksomeness of imprisonment by the exchange of a syllable with any of her fellow captives and when at last arrived in the tea room she felt yet more the awkwardness of having no party to join no acquaintance to claim no gentleman to assist them
How uncomfortable it is whispered Catherine not to have a single acquaintance here
Yet Catherine was in very good looks and had the company only seen her three years before they would _ now _ have thought her exceedingly handsome
She _ was _ looked at however and with some admiration for in her own hearing two gentlemen pronounced her to be a pretty girl
Such words had their due effect she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before her humble vanity was contented she felt more obliged to the two young men for this simple praise than a true quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms and went to her chair in good humour with everybody and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention
