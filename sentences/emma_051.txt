XV This letter must make its way to Emma s feelings
She was obliged in spite of her previous determination to the contrary to do it all the justice that Mrs Weston foretold
He began stopping however almost directly to say Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman s letters to his mother in law a few months ago Emma it would not have been taken with such indifference
And I have not forgotten said Emma how sure you were that he might have come sooner if he would
I was not quite impartial in my judgment Emma but yet I think had you not been in the case I should still have distrusted him
My Emma does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other
Emma agreed to it and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet s account which she could not give any sincere explanation of
Emma knew that he was now getting to the Box Hill party and grew uncomfortable
Her own behaviour had been so very improper
She was deeply ashamed and a little afraid of his next look
It was all read however steadily attentively and without the smallest remark and excepting one momentary glance at her instantly withdrawn in the fear of giving pain no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist
She felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each she dissolved it
What a view this gives of her sense of his behaviour
She had engaged to go as governess to Mrs Smallridge s children a dear friend of Mrs Elton s a neighbour of Maple Grove and by the bye I wonder how Mrs Elton bears the disappointment
Say nothing my dear Emma while you oblige me to read not even of Mrs Elton
Ever since I left you this morning Emma my mind has been hard at work on one subject
Emma s answer was ready at the first word
While her dear father lived any change of condition must be impossible for her
She could never quit him
The impossibility of her quitting her father Mr Knightley felt as strongly as herself but the inadmissibility of any other change he could not agree to
He had been thinking it over most deeply most intently he had at first hoped to induce Mr Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell he had wanted to believe it feasible but his knowledge of Mr Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long and now he confessed his persuasion that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father s comfort perhaps even of his life which must not be hazarded
But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable it was that he should be received at Hartfield that so long as her father s happiness in other words his life required Hartfield to continue her home it should be his likewise
Of their all removing to Donwell Emma had already had her own passing thoughts
Like him she had tried the scheme and rejected it but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her
She was sensible of all the affection it evinced
She felt that in quitting Donwell he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits that in living constantly with her father and in no house of his own there would be much very much to be borne with
She promised to think of it and advised him to think of it more but he was fully convinced that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject
He had given it he could assure her very long and calm consideration he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning to have his thoughts to himself
there is one difficulty unprovided for cried Emma
She promised however to think of it and pretty nearly promised moreover to think of it with the intention of finding it a very good scheme
It is remarkable that Emma in the many very many points of view in which she was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey was never struck with any sense of injury to her nephew Henry whose rights as heir expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded
Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr Knightley s marrying Jane Fairfax or any body else which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt
The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself poor Harriet must in mere charitable caution be kept at a distance from
Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment
