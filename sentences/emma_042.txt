Emma had never been to Box Hill she wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing and she and Mr Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither
This was so very well understood between them that Emma could not but feel some surprise and a little displeasure on hearing from Mr Weston that he had been proposing to Mrs Elton as her brother and sister had failed her that the two parties should unite and go together and that as Mrs Elton had very readily acceded to it so it was to be if she had no objection
Emma denied none of it aloud and agreed to none of it in private
He wished to persuade Mr Woodhouse as well as Emma to join the party and he knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him ill
Some very fine morning he and Emma and Harriet could go very well and he could sit still with Mrs Weston while the dear girls walked about the gardens
He could not see any objection at all to his and Emma s and Harriet s going there some very fine morning
Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it and Mr Weston unasked promised to get Frank over to join them if possible a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with
It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey that as soon as she was satisfied of her father s comfort she was glad to leave him and look around her eager to refresh and correct her memory with more particular observation more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her and all her family
She felt all the honest pride and complacency which her alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant as she viewed the respectable size and style of the building its suitable becoming characteristic situation low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream of which the Abbey with all the old neglect of prospect had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up
It was just what it ought to be and it looked what it was and Emma felt an increasing respect for it as the residence of a family of such true gentility untainted in blood and understanding
Seats tolerably in the shade were found and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of
How Jane could bear it at all was astonishing to Emma
She did look vexed she did speak pointedly and at last with a decision of action unusual to her proposed a removal
She wished to see the whole extent
The pertinacity of her friend seemed more than she could bear
In this walk Emma and Mr Weston found all the others assembled and towards this view she immediately perceived Mr Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest quietly leading the way
There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm but now she feared it not
She joined them at the wall and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around
He was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture etc and Emma received a smile which seemed to say These are my own concerns
She did not suspect him
The shade was most refreshing and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day
Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration she behaved very well and betrayed no emotion
Mrs Weston had been shewing them all to him and now he would shew them all to Emma fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child than in a total want of taste for what he saw for he was slow constant and methodical
Before this second looking over was begun however Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments free observation of the entrance and ground plot of the house and was hardly there when Jane Fairfax appeared coming quickly in from the garden and with a look of escape
She spoke with great agitation and Emma very feelingly replied That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now
I am she answered I am fatigued but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me
Emma had not another word to oppose
She saw it all and entering into her feelings promoted her quitting the house immediately and watched her safely off with the zeal of a friend
Her parting look was grateful and her parting words Oh
said Emma as she turned back into the hall again
Emma had not been thinking of him she had forgotten to think of him but she was very glad to see him
You will soon be cooler if you sit still said Emma
Emma listened and looked and soon perceived that Frank Churchill s state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour
Such might be his constitution and as she knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints she recommended his taking some refreshment he would find abundance of every thing in the dining room and she humanely pointed out the door
Emma returned all her attention to her father saying in secret I am glad I have done being in love with him
Frank Churchill s little inclination to exclude himself increased so much that his last words to Emma were Well if you wish me to stay and join the party I will
She smiled her acceptance and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him back before the following evening
