Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs Jennings and beginning a journey to London under her protection and as her guest without wondering at her own situation so short had their acquaintance with that lady been so wholly unsuited were they in age and disposition and so many had been her objections against such a measure only a few days before
But these objections had all with that happy ardour of youth which Marianne and her mother equally shared been overcome or overlooked and Elinor in spite of every occasional doubt of Willoughby s constancy could not witness the rapture of delightful expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of Marianne without feeling how blank was her own prospect how cheerless her own state of mind in the comparison and how gladly she would engage in the solicitude of Marianne s situation to have the same animating object in view the same possibility of hope
Marianne s eagerness to be gone declared her dependence on finding him there and Elinor was resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his character which her own observation or the intelligence of others could give her but likewise upon watching his behaviour to her sister with such zealous attention as to ascertain what he was and what he meant before many meetings had taken place
Should the result of her observations be unfavourable she was determined at all events to open the eyes of her sister should it be otherwise her exertions would be of a different nature she must then learn to avoid every selfish comparison and banish every regret which might lessen her satisfaction in the happiness of Marianne
To atone for this conduct therefore Elinor took immediate possession of the post of civility which she had assigned herself behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs Jennings talked with her laughed with her and listened to her whenever she could and Mrs Jennings on her side treated them both with all possible kindness was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and enjoyment and only disturbed that she could not make them choose their own dinners at the inn nor extort a confession of their preferring salmon to cod or boiled fowls to veal cutlets
As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their arrival Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her mother and sat down for that purpose
_ I _ am writing home Marianne said Elinor had not you better defer your letter for a day or two
Elinor said no more it immediately struck her that she must then be writing to Willoughby and the conclusion which as instantly followed was that however mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair they must be engaged
This conviction though not entirely satisfactory gave her pleasure and she continued her letter with greater alacrity
Elinor thought she could distinguish a large W in the direction and no sooner was it complete than Marianne ringing the bell requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed for her to the two penny post
It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs Jennings by being much engaged in her own room could see little of what was passing
The tea things were brought in and already had Marianne been disappointed more than once by a rap at a neighbouring door when a loud one was suddenly heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house Elinor felt secure of its announcing Willoughby s approach and Marianne starting up moved towards the door
Every thing was silent this could not be borne many seconds she opened the door advanced a few steps towards the stairs and after listening half a minute returned into the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him would naturally produce in the ecstasy of her feelings at that instant she could not help exclaiming Oh Elinor it is Willoughby indeed it is
It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness and she immediately left the room
Elinor was disappointed too but at the same time her regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his welcome with her and she felt particularly hurt that a man so partial to her sister should perceive that she experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing him
She instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him that he even observed Marianne as she quitted the room with such astonishment and concern as hardly left him the recollection of what civility demanded towards herself
Elinor answered in some distress that she was and then talked of head aches low spirits and over fatigues and of every thing to which she could decently attribute her sister s behaviour
He heard her with the most earnest attention but seeming to recollect himself said no more on the subject and began directly to speak of his pleasure at seeing them in London making the usual inquiries about their journey and the friends they had left behind
Elinor wished very much to ask whether Willoughby were then in town but she was afraid of giving him pain by any enquiry after his rival and at length by way of saying something she asked if he had been in London ever since she had seen him last
This and the manner in which it was said immediately brought back to her remembrance all the circumstances of his quitting that place with the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs Jennings and she was fearful that her question had implied much more curiosity on the subject than she had ever felt
Elinor now began to make the tea and Marianne was obliged to appear again
After an hour or two spent in what her mother called comfortable chat or in other words in every variety of inquiry concerning all their acquaintance on Mrs Jennings s side and in laughter without cause on Mrs Palmer s it was proposed by the latter that they should all accompany her to some shops where she had business that morning to which Mrs Jennings and Elinor readily consented as having likewise some purchases to make themselves and Marianne though declining it at first was induced to go likewise
It was late in the morning before they returned home and no sooner had they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs and when Elinor followed she found her turning from the table with a sorrowful countenance which declared that no Willoughby had been there
said she to the footman who then entered with the parcels
She was answered in the negative
she replied
said she in a low and disappointed voice as she turned away to the window
repeated Elinor within herself regarding her sister with uneasiness
If she had not known him to be in town she would not have written to him as she did she would have written to Combe Magna and if he is in town how odd that he should neither come nor write
The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her evening engagements and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table for the others
Marianne was of no use on these occasions as she would never learn the game but though her time was therefore at her own disposal the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to her than to Elinor for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation and the pain of disappointment
