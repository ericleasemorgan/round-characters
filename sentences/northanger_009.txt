The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated and James who had been engaged quite as long as his sister was very importunate with Isabella to stand up but John was gone into the card room to speak to a friend and nothing she declared should induce her to join the set before her dear Catherine could join it too
Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude and they continued as they were for three minutes longer when Isabella who had been talking to James on the other side of her turned again to his sister and whispered My dear creature I am afraid I must leave you your brother is so amazingly impatient to begin I know you will not mind my going away and I dare say John will be back in a moment and then you may easily find me out
Catherine though a little disappointed had too much good nature to make any opposition and the others rising up Isabella had only time to press her friend s hand and say Good bye my dear love before they hurried off
The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing Catherine was left to the mercy of Mrs Thorpe and Mrs Allen between whom she now remained
She could not help being vexed at the non appearance of Mr Thorpe for she not only longed to be dancing but was likewise aware that as the real dignity of her situation could not be known she was sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all the discredit of wanting a partner
To be disgraced in the eye of the world to wear the appearance of infamy while her heart is all purity her actions all innocence and the misconduct of another the true source of her debasement is one of those circumstances which peculiarly belong to the heroine s life and her fortitude under it what particularly dignifies her character
Catherine had fortitude too she suffered but no murmur passed her lips
From this state of humiliation she was roused at the end of ten minutes to a pleasanter feeling by seeing not Mr Thorpe but Mr Tilney within three yards of the place where they sat he seemed to be moving that way but he did not see her and therefore the smile and the blush which his sudden reappearance raised in Catherine passed away without sullying her heroic importance
He looked as handsome and as lively as ever and was talking with interest to a fashionable and pleasing looking young woman who leant on his arm and whom Catherine immediately guessed to be his sister thus unthinkingly throwing away a fair opportunity of considering him lost to her forever by being married already
But guided only by what was simple and probable it had never entered her head that Mr Tilney could be married he had not behaved he had not talked like the married men to whom she had been used he had never mentioned a wife and he had acknowledged a sister
From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his sister s now being by his side and therefore instead of turning of a deathlike paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs Allen s bosom Catherine sat erect in the perfect use of her senses and with cheeks only a little redder than usual
Mr Tilney and his companion who continued though slowly to approach were immediately preceded by a lady an acquaintance of Mrs Thorpe and this lady stopping to speak to her they as belonging to her stopped likewise and Catherine catching Mr Tilney s eye instantly received from him the smiling tribute of recognition
She returned it with pleasure and then advancing still nearer he spoke both to her and Mrs Allen by whom he was very civilly acknowledged
This was accordingly done Mr Tilney still continuing standing before them and after a few minutes consideration he asked Catherine to dance with him
Mrs Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more happy to oblige her than Catherine
Catherine interested at once by her appearance and her relationship to Mr Tilney was desirous of being acquainted with her and readily talked therefore whenever she could think of anything to say and had courage and leisure for saying it
But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy by the frequent want of one or more of these requisites prevented their doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath how much she admired its buildings and surrounding country whether she drew or played or sang and whether she was fond of riding on horseback
The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her arm gently seized by her faithful Isabella who in great spirits exclaimed At last I have got you
I have been scolding him to such a degree my dear Catherine you would be quite amazed
Look at that young lady with the white beads round her head whispered Catherine detaching her friend from James
Let me look at her this moment
But where is her all conquering brother
In this commonplace chatter which lasted some time the original subject seemed entirely forgotten and though Catherine was very well pleased to have it dropped for a while she could not avoid a little suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella s impatient desire to see Mr Tilney
How can you be so teasing only conceive my dear Catherine what your brother wants me to do
My sweet Catherine do support me persuade your brother how impossible it is
Come along my dearest Catherine for heaven s sake and stand by me
John Thorpe in the meanwhile had walked away and Catherine ever willing to give Mr Tilney an opportunity of repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her once made her way to Mrs Allen and Mrs Thorpe as fast as she could in the hope of finding him still with them a hope which when it proved to be fruitless she felt to have been highly unreasonable
said Catherine looking round but she had not looked round long before she saw him leading a young lady to the dance
This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension of many but it did not puzzle Mrs Allen for after only a moment s consideration she said in a whisper to Catherine I dare say she thought I was speaking of her son
Catherine was disappointed and vexed
She seemed to have missed by so little the very object she had had in view and this persuasion did not incline her to a very gracious reply when John Thorpe came up to her soon afterwards and said Well Miss Morland I suppose you and I are to stand up and jig it together again
Again Catherine excused herself and at last he walked off to quiz his sisters by himself
The rest of the evening she found very dull Mr Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea to attend that of his partner Miss Tilney though belonging to it did not sit near her and James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the latter had no leisure to bestow more on her friend than one smile one squeeze and one dearest Catherine
