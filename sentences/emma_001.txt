I Emma Woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her
She was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister s marriage been mistress of his house from a very early period
Her mother had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short of a mother in affection
Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr Woodhouse s family less as a governess than a friend very fond of both daughters but particularly of Emma
Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess the mildness of her temper had hardly allowed her to impose any restraint and the shadow of authority being now long passed away they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached and Emma doing just what she liked highly esteeming Miss Taylor s judgment but directed chiefly by her own
The real evils indeed of Emma s situation were the power of having rather too much her own way and a disposition to think a little too well of herself these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her many enjoyments
The danger however was at present so unperceived that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her
It was on the wedding day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance
The wedding over and the bride people gone her father and herself were left to dine together with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening
Her father composed himself to sleep after dinner as usual and she had then only to sit and think of what she had lost
The event had every promise of happiness for her friend
Mr Weston was a man of unexceptionable character easy fortune suitable age and pleasant manners and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self denying generous friendship she had always wished and promoted the match but it was a black morning s work for her
It was true that her friend was going only half a mile from them but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs Weston only half a mile from them and a Miss Taylor in the house and with all her advantages natural and domestic she was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude
It was a melancholy change and Emma could not but sigh over it and wish for impossible things till her father awoke and made it necessary to be cheerful
Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she could to keep him from such thoughts but when tea came it was impossible for him not to say exactly as he had said at dinner Poor Miss Taylor
Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas and hoped by the help of backgammon to get her father tolerably through the evening and be attacked by no regrets but her own
I have a great regard for you and Emma but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence
said Emma playfully
Mr Knightley in fact was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse and the only one who ever told her of them and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself she knew it would be so much less so to her father that she would not have him really suspect such a circumstance as her not being thought perfect by every body
Emma knows I never flatter her said Mr Knightley but I meant no reflection on any body
Well said Emma willing to let it pass you want to hear about the wedding and I shall be happy to tell you for we all behaved charmingly
Dear Emma bears every thing so well said her father
But Mr Knightley she is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor and I am sure she will miss her more than she thinks for
Emma turned away her head divided between tears and smiles
It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion said Mr Knightley
We should not like her so well as we do sir if we could suppose it but she knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor s advantage she knows how very acceptable it must be at Miss Taylor s time of life to be settled in a home of her own and how important to her to be secure of a comfortable provision and therefore can not allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure
And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me said Emma and a very considerable one that I made the match myself
Mr Knightley shook his head at her
Her father fondly replied Ah
Emma never thinks of herself if she can do good to others rejoined Mr Woodhouse understanding but in part
Invite him to dinner Emma and help him to the best of the fish and the chicken but leave him to chuse his own wife
