6 Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross to learn that a removal from one set of people to another though at a distance of only three miles will often include a total change of conversation opinion and idea
She had never been staying there before without being struck by it or without wishing that other Elliots could have her advantage in seeing how unknown or unconsidered there were the affairs which at Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading interest yet with all this experience she believed she must now submit to feel that another lesson in the art of knowing our own nothingness beyond our own circle was become necessary for her for certainly coming as she did with a heart full of the subject which had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks she had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she found in the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove So Miss Anne Sir Walter and your sister are gone and what part of Bath do you think they will settle in
Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable in sense and temper he was undoubtedly superior to his wife but not of powers or conversation or grace to make the past as they were connected together at all a dangerous contemplation though at the same time Anne could believe with Lady Russell that a more equal match might have greatly improved him and that a woman of real understanding might have given more consequence to his character and more usefulness rationality and elegance to his habits and pursuits
He had very good spirits which never seemed much affected by his wife s occasional lowness bore with her unreasonableness sometimes to Anne s admiration and upon the whole though there was very often a little disagreement in which she had sometimes more share than she wished being appealed to by both parties they might pass for a happy couple
I could manage them very well if it were not for Mary s interference was what Anne often heard him say and had a good deal of faith in but when listening in turn to Mary s reproach of Charles spoils the children so that I can not get them into any order she never had the smallest temptation to say Very true
I am sure Anne if you would you might persuade him that I really am very ill a great deal worse than I ever own
And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity of being alone with Anne to say Oh
Miss Anne I can not help wishing Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children
I assure you Miss Anne it prevents my wishing to see them at our house so often as I otherwise should
And on Mrs Musgrove s side it was I make a rule of never interfering in any of my daughter in law s concerns for I know it would not do but I shall tell you Miss Anne because you may be able to set things to rights that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles s nursery maid I hear strange stories of her she is always upon the gad and from my own knowledge I can declare she is such a fine dressing lady that she is enough to ruin any servants she comes near
And one day when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves one of them after talking of rank people of rank and jealousy of rank said I have no scruple of observing to you how nonsensical some persons are about their place because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you are about it but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would be a great deal better if she were not so very tenacious especially if she would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma
How was Anne to set all these matters to rights
She could do little more than listen patiently soften every grievance and excuse each to the other give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between such near neighbours and make those hints broadest which were meant for her sister s benefit
In all other respects her visit began and proceeded very well
Her own spirits improved by change of place and subject by being removed three miles from Kellynch Mary s ailments lessened by having a constant companion and their daily intercourse with the other family since there was neither superior affection confidence nor employment in the cottage to be interrupted by it was rather an advantage
There was a family of cousins within a walk of Uppercross in less affluent circumstances who depended on the Musgroves for all their pleasures they would come at any time and help play at anything or dance anywhere and Anne very much preferring the office of musician to a more active post played country dances to them by the hour together a kindness which always recommended her musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove more than anything else and often drew this compliment Well done Miss Anne
Michaelmas came and now Anne s heart must be in Kellynch again
She could not think of much else on the 29th of September and she had this sympathetic touch in the evening from Mary who on having occasion to note down the day of the month exclaimed Dear me is not this the day the Crofts were to come to Kellynch
Anne had very sincerely rejoiced in there being no means of her going
She wished however to see the Crofts and was glad to be within when the visit was returned
They came the master of the house was not at home but the two sisters were together and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the share of Anne while the Admiral sat by Mary and made himself very agreeable by his good humoured notice of her little boys she was well able to watch for a likeness and if it failed her in the features to catch it in the voice or in the turn of sentiment and expression
Anne gave her credit indeed for feelings of great consideration towards herself in all that related to Kellynch and it pleased her especially as she had satisfied herself in the very first half minute in the instant even of introduction that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge or suspicion on Mrs Croft s side to give a bias of any sort
Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing but the age of emotion she certainly had not
He was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys clinging to him like an old friend and declaring he should not go and being too much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his coat pockets c to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he had begun Anne was left to persuade herself as well as she could that the same brother must still be in question
She could not however reach such a degree of certainty as not to be anxious to hear whether anything had been said on the subject at the other house where the Crofts had previously been calling
To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth repeating his name so often puzzling over past years and at last ascertaining that it might that it probably would turn out to be the very same Captain Wentworth whom they recollected meeting once or twice after their coming back from Clifton a very fine young man but they could not say whether it was seven or eight years ago was a new sort of trial to Anne s nerves
She found however that it was one to which she must inure herself
Since he actually was expected in the country she must teach herself to be insensible on such points
