But though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt _ was _ carried home to her mind though she saw with satisfaction the effect of it in her no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he called in her speaking to him even voluntarily speaking with a kind of compassionate respect and though she saw her spirits less violently irritated than before she did not see her less wretched
Her mind did become settled but it was settled in a gloomy dejection
She felt the loss of Willoughby s character yet more heavily than she had felt the loss of his heart his seduction and desertion of Miss Williams the misery of that poor girl and the doubt of what his designs might _ once _ have been on herself preyed altogether so much on her spirits that she could not bring herself to speak of what she felt even to Elinor and brooding over her sorrows in silence gave more pain to her sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most frequent confession of them
To give the feelings or the language of Mrs Dashwood on receiving and answering Elinor s letter would be only to give a repetition of what her daughters had already felt and said of a disappointment hardly less painful than Marianne s and an indignation even greater than Elinor s
Long letters from her quickly succeeding each other arrived to tell all that she suffered and thought to express her anxious solicitude for Marianne and entreat she would bear up with fortitude under this misfortune
But it was a matter of great consolation to her that what brought evil to herself would bring good to her sister and Elinor on the other hand suspecting that it would not be in her power to avoid Edward entirely comforted herself by thinking that though their longer stay would therefore militate against her own happiness it would be better for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards herself but that was impossible and she was obliged to listen day after day to the indignation of them all
The rest of Mrs Palmer s sympathy was shown in procuring all the particulars in her power of the approaching marriage and communicating them to Elinor
She could soon tell at what coachmaker s the new carriage was building by what painter Mr Willoughby s portrait was drawn and at what warehouse Miss Grey s clothes might be seen
The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a happy relief to Elinor s spirits oppressed as they often were by the clamorous kindness of the others
It was a great comfort to her to be sure of exciting no interest in _ one _ person at least among their circle of friends a great comfort to know that there was _ one _ who would meet her without feeling any curiosity after particulars or any anxiety for her sister s health
Every qualification is raised at times by the circumstances of the moment to more than its real value and she was sometimes worried down by officious condolence to rate good breeding as more indispensable to comfort than good nature
_ These _ assured him that his exertion had produced an increase of good will towards himself and _ these _ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter but Mrs Jennings who knew nothing of all this who knew only that the Colonel continued as grave as ever and that she could neither prevail on him to make the offer himself nor commission her to make it for him began at the end of two days to think that instead of Midsummer they would not be married till Michaelmas and by the end of a week that it would not be a match at all
Early in February within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby s letter Elinor had the painful office of informing her sister that he was married
She had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to herself as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over as she was desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from the public papers which she saw her eagerly examining every morning
The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married and Elinor now hoped as there could be no danger of her seeing either of them to prevail on her sister who had never yet left the house since the blow first fell to go out again by degrees as she had done before
Elinor only was sorry to see them
Their presence always gave her pain and she hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her _ still _ in town
Elinor perfectly understood her and was forced to use all her self command to make it appear that she did _ not _
Elinor would not humour her by farther opposition
Elinor with great civility declined the proposal
Her sister was perhaps laid down upon the bed or in her dressing gown and therefore not able to come to them
Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her temper but she was saved the trouble of checking it by Lucy s sharp reprimand which now as on many occasions though it did not give much sweetness to the manners of one sister was of advantage in governing those of the other
