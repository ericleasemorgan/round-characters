33 More than once did Elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet Mr Darcy
She felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers
Is this thought Elizabeth meant for me
and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone And pray what is the usual price of an earl s younger son
He answered her in the same style and the subject dropped
To interrupt a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed she soon afterwards said I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal
yes said Elizabeth drily Mr Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr Bingley and takes a prodigious deal of care of him
Elizabeth made no answer and walked on her heart swelling with indignation
After watching her a little Fitzwilliam asked her why she was so thoughtful
I am thinking of what you have been telling me said she
But she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him
This was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of Mr Darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage
There shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard
It was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected
