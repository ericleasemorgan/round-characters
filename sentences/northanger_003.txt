His address was good and Catherine felt herself in high luck
There was little leisure for speaking while they danced but when they were seated at tea she found him as agreeable as she had already given him credit for being
He talked with fluency and spirit and there was an archness and pleasantry in his manner which interested though it was hardly understood by her
After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the objects around them he suddenly addressed her with I have hitherto been very remiss madam in the proper attentions of a partner here I have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath whether you were ever here before whether you have been at the Upper Rooms the theatre and the concert and how you like the place altogether
About a week sir replied Catherine trying not to laugh
Catherine turned away her head not knowing whether she might venture to laugh
I have sometimes thought said Catherine doubtingly whether ladies do write so much better letters than gentlemen
They were interrupted by Mrs Allen My dear Catherine said she do take this pin out of my sleeve I am afraid it has torn a hole already I shall be quite sorry if it has for this is a favourite gown though it cost but nine shillings a yard
How can you said Catherine laughing be so She had almost said strange
Catherine feared as she listened to their discourse that he indulged himself a little too much with the foibles of others
Catherine coloured and said I was not thinking of anything
