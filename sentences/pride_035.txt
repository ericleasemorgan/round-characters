35 Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes
She could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise
She was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of Mr Darcy s sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpike road
The park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground
After walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park
The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees
She was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being Mr Darcy she was directly retreating
But the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name
She had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be Mr Darcy she moved again towards the gate
He had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure I have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you
With no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity Elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper written quite through in a very close hand
Pursuing her way along the lane she then began it
