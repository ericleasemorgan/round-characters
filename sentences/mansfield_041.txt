XLI A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town and Fanny had heard nothing of him
There were three different conclusions to be drawn from his silence between which her mind was in fluctuation each of them at times being held the most probable
And the consequence was that Fanny strange as it was strange awkward and distressing found herself and Susan within ten minutes walking towards the High Street with Mr Crawford
He stopt and ungentlemanlike as he looked Fanny was obliged to introduce him to Mr Crawford
She could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr Crawford must be struck
He must soon give her up and cease to have the smallest inclination for the match and yet though she had been so much wanting his affection to be cured this was a sort of cure that would be almost as bad as the complaint and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of being sought by a clever agreeable man than have him driven away by the vulgarity of her nearest relations
The conclusion of the two gentlemen s civilities was an offer of Mr Price s to take Mr Crawford into the dockyard which Mr Crawford desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such though he had seen the dockyard again and again and hoping to be so much the longer with Fanny was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of if the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue and as it was somehow or other ascertained or inferred or at least acted upon that they were not at all afraid to the dockyard they were all to go and but for Mr Crawford Mr Price would have turned thither directly without the smallest consideration for his daughters errands in the High Street
When Mr Price and his friend had seen all that they wished or had time for the others were ready to return and in the course of their walk back Mr Crawford contrived a minute s privacy for telling Fanny that his only business in Portsmouth was to see her that he was come down for a couple of days on her account and hers only and because he could not endure a longer total separation
She was sorry really sorry and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which she wished he had not said she thought him altogether improved since she had seen him he was much more gentle obliging and attentive to other people s feelings than he had ever been at Mansfield she had never seen him so agreeable so _ near _ being agreeable his behaviour to her father could not offend and there was something particularly kind and proper in the notice he took of Susan
Her father asked him to do them the honour of taking his mutton with them and Fanny had time for only one thrill of horror before he declared himself prevented by a prior engagement
