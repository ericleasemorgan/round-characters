Elinor without observing the varying complexion of her sister and the animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan immediately gave a grateful but absolute denial for both in which she believed herself to be speaking their united inclinations
But my mother my dearest kindest mother I feel the justice of what Elinor has urged and if she were to be made less happy less comfortable by our absence Oh
no nothing should tempt me to leave her
Mrs Jennings repeated her assurance that Mrs Dashwood could spare them perfectly well and Elinor who now understood her sister and saw to what indifference to almost every thing else she was carried by her eagerness to be with Willoughby again made no farther direct opposition to the plan and merely referred it to her mother s decision from whom however she scarcely expected to receive any support in her endeavour to prevent a visit which she could not approve of for Marianne and which on her own account she had particular reasons to avoid
That Marianne fastidious as she was thoroughly acquainted with Mrs Jennings manners and invariably disgusted by them should overlook every inconvenience of that kind should disregard whatever must be most wounding to her irritable feelings in her pursuit of one object was such a proof so strong so full of the importance of that object to her as Elinor in spite of all that had passed was not prepared to witness
Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness said Elinor you have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which occurred to you there is still one objection which in my opinion can not be so easily removed
And what said Mrs Dashwood is my dear prudent Elinor going to suggest
What formidable obstacle is she now to bring forward
If Elinor is frightened away by her dislike of Mrs Jennings said Marianne at least it need not prevent MY accepting her invitation
Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards the manners of a person to whom she had often had difficulty in persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness and resolved within herself that if her sister persisted in going she would go likewise as she did not think it proper that Marianne should be left to the sole guidance of her own judgment or that Mrs Jennings should be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her domestic hours
You will have much pleasure in being in London and especially in being together and if Elinor would ever condescend to anticipate enjoyment she would foresee it there from a variety of sources she would perhaps expect some from improving her acquaintance with her sister in law s family
Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her mother s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself that the shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed and now on this attack though almost hopeless of success she forced herself to begin her design by saying as calmly as she could I like Edward Ferrars very much and shall always be glad to see him but as to the rest of the family it is a matter of perfect indifference to me whether I am ever known to them or not
Marianne lifted up her eyes in astonishment and Elinor conjectured that she might as well have held her tongue
Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her wishes with less reluctance than she had expected to feel
With regard to herself it was now a matter of unconcern whether she went to town or not and when she saw her mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan and her sister exhilarated by it in look voice and manner restored to all her usual animation and elevated to more than her usual gaiety she could not be dissatisfied with the cause and would hardly allow herself to distrust the consequence
Her mother s affliction was hardly less and Elinor was the only one of the three who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of eternal
