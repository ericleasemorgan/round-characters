Her father read his newspaper and her mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual while the tea was in preparation and wished Rebecca would mend it and Fanny was first roused by his calling out to her after humphing and considering over a particular paragraph What s the name of your great cousins in town Fan
A moment s recollection enabled her to say Rushworth sir
There holding out the paper to her much good may such fine relations do you
The girls heard his entrance from above and Fanny went down
The idea of immediately seeing him with the knowledge of what he must be suffering brought back all her own first feelings
He so near her and in misery
She was ready to sink as she entered the parlour
He was alone and met her instantly and she found herself pressed to his heart with only these words just articulate My Fanny my only sister my only comfort now
