was a question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table
She had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge
She coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth
Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and Elizabeth agitated and confused rather _ knew _ that she was happy than _ felt _ herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her
She anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but Jane and even feared that with the others it was a _ dislike _ which not all his fortune and consequence might do away
Elizabeth again and more seriously assured her of its truth
forgive the question are you quite certain that you can be happy with him
Elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy
She had been unwilling to mention Bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend
But now she would no longer conceal from her his share in Lydia s marriage
Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal yet was really vexed that her mother should be always giving him such an epithet
As soon as they entered Bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud Mrs Bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her way again to day
Darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the Mount and Elizabeth silently consented
As she went up stairs to get ready Mrs Bennet followed her saying I am quite sorry Lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself
Elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mother s
She could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man
But whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that Mr Darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation
In the evening soon after Mr Bennet withdrew to the library she saw Mr Darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme
She did not fear her father s opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her means that _ she _ his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of her was a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till Mr Darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile
In a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with Kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper Go to your father he wants you in the library
Have you any other objection said Elizabeth than your belief of my indifference
I do I do like him she replied with tears in her eyes I love him
Elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that Mr Darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her father s incredulity and reconcile him to the match
Well my dear said he when she ceased speaking I have no more to say
Elizabeth s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hour s quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure
When her mother went up to her dressing room at night she followed her and made the important communication
This was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and Elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away
But before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her
My dearest child she cried I can think of nothing else
This was a sad omen of what her mother s behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and Elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for
But the morrow passed off much better than she expected for Mrs Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended son in law that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion
Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her father taking pains to get acquainted with him and Mr Bennet soon assured her that he was rising every hour in his esteem
