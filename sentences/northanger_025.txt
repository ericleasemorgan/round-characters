It was Sunday and the whole time between morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise abroad or eating cold meat at home and great as was Catherine s curiosity her courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after dinner either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven o clock or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a treacherous lamp
The day was unmarked therefore by anything to interest her imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to the memory of Mrs Tilney which immediately fronted the family pew
That the general having erected such a monument should be able to face it was not perhaps very strange and yet that he could sit so boldly collected within its view maintain so elevated an air look so fearlessly around nay that he should even enter the church seemed wonderful to Catherine
She could remember dozens who had persevered in every possible vice going on from crime to crime murdering whomsoever they chose without any feeling of humanity or remorse till a violent death or a religious retirement closed their black career
The erection of the monument itself could not in the smallest degree affect her doubts of Mrs Tilney s actual decease
Were she even to descend into the family vault where her ashes were supposed to slumber were she to behold the coffin in which they were said to be enclosed what could it avail in such a case
Catherine had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a waxen figure might be introduced and a supposititious funeral carried on
The general s early walk ill timed as it was in every other view was favourable here and when she knew him to be out of the house she directly proposed to Miss Tilney the accomplishment of her promise
Eleanor was ready to oblige her and Catherine reminding her as they went of another promise their first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her bed chamber
It represented a very lovely woman with a mild and pensive countenance justifying so far the expectations of its new observer but they were not in every respect answered for Catherine had depended upon meeting with features hair complexion that should be the very counterpart the very image if not of Henry s of Eleanor s the only portraits of which she had been in the habit of thinking bearing always an equal resemblance of mother and child
Again she passed through the folding doors again her hand was upon the important lock and Catherine hardly able to breathe was turning to close the former with fearful caution when the figure the dreaded figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery stood before her
The name of Eleanor at the same moment in his loudest tone resounded through the building giving to his daughter the first intimation of his presence and to Catherine terror upon terror
An attempt at concealment had been her first instinctive movement on perceiving him yet she could scarcely hope to have escaped his eye and when her friend who with an apologizing look darted hastily by her had joined and disappeared with him she ran for safety to her own room and locking herself in believed that she should never have courage to go down again
She remained there at least an hour in the greatest agitation deeply commiserating the state of her poor friend and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him in his own apartment
No summons however arrived and at last on seeing a carriage drive up to the abbey she was emboldened to descend and meet him under the protection of visitors
The breakfast room was gay with company and she was named to them by the general as the friend of his daughter in a complimentary style which so well concealed his resentful ire as to make her feel secure at least of life for the present
It was done and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before the clocks had ceased to strike
It was no time for thought she hurried on slipped with the least possible noise through the folding doors and without stopping to look or breathe rushed forward to the one in question
The lock yielded to her hand and luckily with no sullen sound that could alarm a human being
On tiptoe she entered the room was before her but it was some minutes before she could advance another step
She beheld what fixed her to the spot and agitated every feature
She saw a large well proportioned apartment an handsome dimity bed arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid s care a bright Bath stove mahogany wardrobes and neatly painted chairs on which the warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows
Catherine had expected to have her feelings worked and worked they were
She could not be mistaken as to the room but how grossly mistaken in everything else
Catherine recollected herself blushed deeply and could say no more
He seemed to be looking in her countenance for that explanation which her lips did not afford
She moved on towards the gallery
I have been said Catherine looking down to see your mother s room
Catherine said nothing
After a short silence during which he had closely observed her he added As there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity this must have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother s character as described by Eleanor which does honour to her memory
But your father said Catherine was _ he _ afflicted
You have erred in supposing him not attached to her
He loved her I am persuaded as well as it was possible for him to we have not all you know the same tenderness of disposition and I will not pretend to say that while she lived she might not often have had much to bear but though his temper injured her his judgment never did
His value of her was sincere and if not permanently he was truly afflicted by her death
I am very glad of it said Catherine it would have been very shocking
