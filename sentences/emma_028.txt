Busy as he was however the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again
That she was not immediately ready Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion she must reason herself into the power of performance and Emma could not but pity such feelings whatever their origin and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again
Mrs Weston had been delighted before and was delighted again Emma joined her in all her praise and the pianoforte with every proper discrimination was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise
Whoever Colonel Campbell might employ said Frank Churchill with a smile at Emma the person has not chosen ill
It is not fair said Emma in a whisper mine was a random guess
Do not distress her
He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte and turning to Emma said Here is something quite new to me
Emma wished he would be less pointed yet could not help being amused and when on glancing her eye towards Jane Fairfax she caught the remains of a smile when she saw that with all the deep blush of consciousness there had been a smile of secret delight she had less scruple in the amusement and much less compunction with respect to her
Emma took the opportunity of whispering You speak too plain
She must understand you
I hope she does
I would have her understand me
I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways
Leave shame to her
If she does wrong she ought to feel it
She is not entirely without it I think
She is playing Robin Adair at this moment his favourite
The listeners were amused and Mrs Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism
Emma found it really time to be at home the visit had already lasted long and on examining watches so much of the morning was perceived to be gone that Mrs Weston and her companion taking leave also could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates before they set off for Randalls
