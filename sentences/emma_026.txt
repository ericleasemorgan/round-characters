He was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever and after seeing him Emma thus moralised to herself I do not know whether it ought to be so but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way
She followed another carriage to Mr Cole s door and was pleased to see that it was Mr Knightley s for Mr Knightley keeping no horses having little spare money and a great deal of health activity and independence was too apt in Emma s opinion to get about as he could and not use his carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey
She had an opportunity now of speaking her approbation while warm from her heart for he stopped to hand her out
This is coming as you should do said she like a gentleman
He thanked her observing How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment
Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr Knightley
She was received with a cordial respect which could not but please and given all the consequence she could wish for
When the Westons arrived the kindest looks of love the strongest of admiration were for her from both husband and wife the son approached her with a cheerful eagerness which marked her as his peculiar object and at dinner she found him seated by her and as she firmly believed not without some dexterity on his side
The less worthy females were to come in the evening with Miss Bates Miss Fairfax and Miss Smith but already at dinner they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general and while politics and Mr Elton were talked over Emma could fairly surrender all her attention to the pleasantness of her neighbour
The first remote sound to which she felt herself obliged to attend was the name of Jane Fairfax
That very dear part of Emma her fancy received an amusing supply
Mrs Cole had many to agree with her every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her own way and still listen to Mrs Cole
They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others but when the table was again safely covered when every corner dish was placed exactly right and occupation and ease were generally restored Emma said The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me
Emma watched the entree of her own particular little friend and if she could not exult in her dignity and grace she could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner but could most heartily rejoice in that light cheerful unsentimental disposition which allowed her so many alleviations of pleasure in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection
There she sat and who would have guessed how many tears she had been lately shedding
Jane Fairfax did look and move superior but Emma suspected she might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes of having loved even Mr Elton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her friend
In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her
She did not wish to speak of the pianoforte she felt too much in the secret herself to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair and therefore purposely kept at a distance but by the others the subject was almost immediately introduced and she saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of my excellent friend Colonel Campbell
Mrs Weston kind hearted and musical was particularly interested by the circumstance and Emma could not help being amused at her perseverance in dwelling on the subject and having so much to ask and to say as to tone touch and pedal totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible which she plainly read in the fair heroine s countenance
Emma divined what every body present must be thinking
She was his object and every body must perceive it
She introduced him to her friend Miss Smith and at convenient moments afterwards heard what each thought of the other
He had never seen so lovely a face and was delighted with her na vet
And she Only to be sure it was paying him too great a compliment but she did think there were some looks a little like Mr Elton
Emma restrained her indignation and only turned from her in silence
Smiles of intelligence passed between her and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax but it was most prudent to avoid speech
He told her that he had been impatient to leave the dining room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he could that his father Mr Knightley Mr Cox and Mr Cole were left very busy over parish business that as long as he had staid however it had been pleasant enough as he had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike sensible men and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that Emma began to feel she had been used to despise the place rather too much
She questioned him as to the society in Yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe and the sort and could make out from his answers that as far as Enscombe was concerned there was very little going on that their visitings were among a range of great families none very near and that even when days were fixed and invitations accepted it was an even chance that Mrs Churchill were not in health and spirits for going that they made a point of visiting no fresh person and that though he had his separate engagements it was not without difficulty without considerable address at times that he could get away or introduce an acquaintance for a night
The unpersuadable point which he did not mention Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his father
The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room Emma found herself obliged to turn from him for a few minutes and listen to Mr Cole
When Mr Cole had moved away and her attention could be restored as before she saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax who was sitting exactly opposite
said she
I believe I have been very rude but really Miss Fairfax has done her hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that I can not keep my eyes from her
This must be a fancy of her own
I see nobody else looking like her
I must go and ask her whether it is an Irish fashion
Yes I will I declare I will and you shall see how she takes it whether she colours
He was gone immediately and Emma soon saw him standing before Miss Fairfax and talking to her but as to its effect on the young lady as he had improvidently placed himself exactly between them exactly in front of Miss Fairfax she could absolutely distinguish nothing
Before he could return to his chair it was taken by Mrs Weston
My dear Emma I am longing to talk to you
Very likely said Emma nothing more likely
exclaimed Emma
My dear Emma I have told you what led me to think of it
My dear Emma as long as he thinks so it is so but if he really loves Jane Fairfax Nonsense
For shame Emma
Do not mimic her
There might be scruples of delicacy my dear Emma
They combated the point some time longer in the same way Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her friend for Mrs Weston was the most used of the two to yield till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over and the instrument in preparation and at the same moment Mr Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it
Frank Churchill of whom in the eagerness of her conversation with Mrs Weston she had been seeing nothing except that he had found a seat by Miss Fairfax followed Mr Cole to add his very pressing entreaties and as in every respect it suited Emma best to lead she gave a very proper compliance
She knew the limitations of her own powers too well to attempt more than she could perform with credit she wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable and could accompany her own voice well
One accompaniment to her song took her agreeably by surprize a second slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill
Her pardon was duly begged at the close of the song and every thing usual followed
They sang together once more and Emma would then resign her place to Miss Fairfax whose performance both vocal and instrumental she never could attempt to conceal from herself was infinitely superior to her own
With mixed feelings she seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument to listen
But the sight of Mr Knightley among the most attentive soon drew away half Emma s mind and she fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs Weston s suspicions to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions
From that moment Emma could have taken her oath that Mr Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument
Mrs Weston capital in her country dances was seated and beginning an irresistible waltz and Frank Churchill coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma had secured her hand and led her up to the top
While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off Emma found time in spite of the compliments she was receiving on her voice and her taste to look about and see what became of Mr Knightley
Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry his interest was yet safe and she led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment
Not more than five couple could be mustered but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful and she found herself well matched in a partner
Perhaps it is as well said Frank Churchill as he attended Emma to her carriage
I must have asked Miss Fairfax and her languid dancing would not have agreed with me after yours
