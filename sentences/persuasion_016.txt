16 There was one point which Anne on returning to her family would have been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot s being in love with Elizabeth which was her father s not being in love with Mrs Clay and she was very far from easy about it when she had been at home a few hours
He spoke and looked so much in earnest that Anne was not surprised to see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself
In the course of the same morning Anne and her father chancing to be alone together he began to compliment her on her improved looks he thought her less thin in her person in her cheeks her skin her complexion greatly improved clearer fresher
Had she been using any thing in particular
Such personal praise might have struck her especially as it did not appear to Anne that the freckles were at all lessened
The sight of Mrs Clay in such favour and of Anne so overlooked was a perpetual provocation to her there and vexed her as much when she was away as a person in Bath who drinks the water gets all the new publications and has a very large acquaintance has time to be vexed
As Mr Elliot became known to her she grew more charitable or more indifferent towards the others
His manners were an immediate recommendation and on conversing with him she found the solid so fully supporting the superficial that she was at first as she told Anne almost ready to exclaim Can this be Mr Elliot
It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she and her excellent friend could sometimes think differently and it did not surprise her therefore that Lady Russell should see nothing suspicious or inconsistent nothing to require more motives than appeared in Mr Elliot s great desire of a reconciliation
Anne presumed however still to smile about it and at last to mention Elizabeth
It was a reference to the future which Anne after a little observation felt she must submit to
She could determine nothing at present
In fact Anne could never see the crape round his hat without fearing that she was the inexcusable one in attributing to him such imaginations for though his marriage had not been very happy still it had existed so many years that she could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the awful impression of its being dissolved
However it might end he was without any question their pleasantest acquaintance in Bath she saw nobody equal to him and it was a great indulgence now and then to talk to him about Lyme which he seemed to have as lively a wish to see again and to see more of as herself
He gave her to understand that he had looked at her with some earnestness
She knew it well and she remembered another person s look also
His value for rank and connexion she perceived was greater than hers
It was not merely complaisance it must be a liking to the cause which made him enter warmly into her father and sister s solicitudes on a subject which she thought unworthy to excite them
The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple and her daughter the Honourable Miss Carteret and all the comfort of No
Camden Place was swept away for many days for the Dalrymples in Anne s opinion most unfortunately were cousins of the Elliots and the agony was how to introduce themselves properly
Anne had never seen her father and sister before in contact with nobility and she must acknowledge herself disappointed
She had hoped better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life and was reduced to form a wish which she had never foreseen a wish that they had more pride for our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret our cousins the Dalrymples sounded in her ears all day long
Anne was ashamed
Lady Russell confessed she had expected something better but yet it was an acquaintance worth having and when Anne ventured to speak her opinion of them to Mr Elliot he agreed to their being nothing in themselves but still maintained that as a family connexion as good company as those who would collect good company around them they had their value
Anne smiled and said My idea of good company Mr Elliot is the company of clever well informed people who have a great deal of conversation that is what I call good company
My cousin Anne shakes her head
She is not satisfied
She is fastidious
My dear cousin sitting down by her you have a better right to be fastidious than almost any other woman I know but will it answer
Yes sighed Anne we shall indeed be known to be related to them
then recollecting herself and not wishing to be answered she added I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to procure the acquaintance
Well said Anne I certainly am proud too proud to enjoy a welcome which depends so entirely upon place
He looked as he spoke to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately occupying a sufficient explanation of what he particularly meant and though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride she was pleased with him for not liking Mrs Clay and her conscience admitted that his wishing to promote her father s getting great acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her
