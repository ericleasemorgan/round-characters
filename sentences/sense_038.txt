Mrs Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward s conduct but only Elinor and Marianne understood its true merit
Elinor gloried in his integrity and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for his punishment
Elinor avoided it upon principle as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts by the too warm too positive assurances of Marianne that belief of Edward s continued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away and Marianne s courage soon failed her in trying to converse upon a topic which always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever by the comparison it necessarily produced between Elinor s conduct and her own
She felt all the force of that comparison but not as her sister had hoped to urge her to exertion now she felt it with all the pain of continual self reproach regretted most bitterly that she had never exerted herself before but it brought only the torture of penitence without the hope of amendment
Her mind was so much weakened that she still fancied present exertion impossible and therefore it only dispirited her more
Mrs Jennings and Elinor were of the number but Marianne who knew that the Willoughbys were again in town and had a constant dread of meeting them chose rather to stay at home than venture into so public a place
An intimate acquaintance of Mrs Jennings joined them soon after they entered the Gardens and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuing with them and engaging all Mrs Jennings s conversation she was herself left to quiet reflection
Mrs Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor Get it all out of her my dear
It was lucky however for Mrs Jennings s curiosity and Elinor s too that she would tell any thing _ without _ being asked for nothing would otherwise have been learnt
She had wandered away to a subject on which Elinor had nothing to say and therefore soon judged it expedient to find her way back again to the first
I never heard any thing of the kind hinted at before I assure you said Elinor
I do not understand what you mean by interrupting them said Elinor you were all in the same room together were not you
cried Elinor have you been repeating to me what you only learnt yourself by listening at the door
Elinor tried to talk of something else but Miss Steele could not be kept beyond a couple of minutes from what was uppermost in her mind
Well said Elinor it is a comfort to be prepared against the worst
Such was her parting concern for after this she had time only to pay her farewell compliments to Mrs Jennings before her company was claimed by Mrs Richardson and Elinor was left in possession of knowledge which might feed her powers of reflection some time though she had learnt very little more than what had been already foreseen and foreplanned in her own mind
As soon as they returned to the carriage Mrs Jennings was eager for information but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possible intelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained she confined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars as she felt assured that Lucy for the sake of her own consequence would choose to have known
The next morning brought Elinor a letter by the two penny post from Lucy herself
My paper reminds me to conclude and begging to be most gratefully and respectfully remembered to her and to Sir John and Lady Middleton and the dear children when you chance to see them and love to Miss Marianne I am c As soon as Elinor had finished it she performed what she concluded to be its writer s real design by placing it in the hands of Mrs Jennings who read it aloud with many comments of satisfaction and praise
