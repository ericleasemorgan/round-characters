Fanny took the work very quietly without attempting any defence but her kinder aunt Bertram observed on her behalf One can not wonder sister that Fanny _ should _ be delighted it is all new to her you know you and I used to be very fond of a play ourselves and so am I still and as soon as I am a little more at leisure _ I _ mean to look in at their rehearsals too
What is the play about Fanny
I believe said Fanny to her aunt Bertram there will be three acts rehearsed to morrow evening and that will give you an opportunity of seeing all the actors at once
The morrow came the plan for the evening continued and Fanny s consideration of it did not become less agitated
She worked very diligently under her aunt s directions but her diligence and her silence concealed a very absent anxious mind and about noon she made her escape with her work to the East room that she might have no concern in another and as she deemed it most unnecessary rehearsal of the first act which Henry Crawford was just proposing desirous at once of having her time to herself and of avoiding the sight of Mr Rushworth
A glimpse as she passed through the hall of the two ladies walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her wish of retreat and she worked and meditated in the East room undisturbed for a quarter of an hour when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the entrance of Miss Crawford
She began and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire but with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of a man
Edmund proposed urged entreated it till the lady not very unwilling at first could refuse no longer and Fanny was wanted only to prompt and observe them
She was invested indeed with the office of judge and critic and earnestly desired to exercise it and tell them all their faults but from doing so every feeling within her shrank she could not would not dared not attempt it had she been otherwise qualified for criticism her conscience must have restrained her from venturing at disapprobation
She believed herself to feel too much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars
To prompt them must be enough for her and it was sometimes _ more _ than enough for she could not always pay attention to the book
In watching them she forgot herself and agitated by the increasing spirit of Edmund s manner had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he wanted help
It was imputed to very reasonable weariness and she was thanked and pitied but she deserved their pity more than she hoped they would ever surmise
At last the scene was over and Fanny forced herself to add her praise to the compliments each was giving the other and when again alone and able to recall the whole she was inclined to believe their performance would indeed have such nature and feeling in it as must ensure their credit and make it a very suffering exhibition to herself
Whatever might be its effect however she must stand the brunt of it again that very day
She was immediately surrounded by supplications everybody asked it even Edmund said Do Fanny if it is not _ very _ disagreeable to you
