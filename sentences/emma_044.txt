VIII The wretchedness of a scheme to Box Hill was in Emma s thoughts all the evening
How it might be considered by the rest of the party she could not tell
They in their different homes and their different ways might be looking back on it with pleasure but in her view it was a morning more completely misspent more totally bare of rational satisfaction at the time and more to be abhorred in recollection than any she had ever passed
A whole evening of back gammon with her father was felicity to it
There indeed lay real pleasure for there she was giving up the sweetest hours of the twenty four to his comfort and feeling that unmerited as might be the degree of his fond affection and confiding esteem she could not in her general conduct be open to any severe reproach
Emma seriously hoped she would
She had a moment s fear of Miss Bates keeping away from her
But Miss Bates soon came Very happy and obliged but Emma s conscience told her that there was not the same cheerful volubility as before less ease of look and manner
Emma was most sincerely interested
Her heart had been long growing kinder towards Jane and this picture of her present sufferings acted as a cure of every former ungenerous suspicion and left her nothing but pity and the remembrance of the less just and less gentle sensations of the past obliged her to admit that Jane might very naturally resolve on seeing Mrs Cole or any other steady friend when she might not bear to see herself
There was no bearing such an always and to break through her dreadful gratitude Emma made the direct inquiry of Where may I ask
madam cried Emma if other children are at all like what I remember to have been myself I should think five times the amount of what I have ever yet heard named as a salary on such occasions dearly earned
Miss Bates would hardly give Emma time to say how perfectly new this circumstance was to her but as without supposing it possible that she could be ignorant of any of the particulars of Mr Frank Churchill s going she proceeded to give them all it was of no consequence
There was nothing in all this either to astonish or interest and it caught Emma s attention only as it united with the subject which already engaged her mind
Now Emma was obliged to think of the pianoforte and the remembrance of all her former fanciful and unfair conjectures was so little pleasing that she soon allowed herself to believe her visit had been long enough and with a repetition of every thing that she could venture to say of the good wishes which she really felt took leave
