It was no longer in Emma s power to superintend his happiness or quicken his measures
The coming of her sister s family was so very near at hand that first in anticipation and then in reality it became henceforth her prime object of interest and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected she did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her to the lovers
She hardly wished to have more leisure for them
It did not often happen for Mr John Knightley had really a great regard for his father in law and generally a strong sense of what was due to him but it was too often for Emma s charity especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured though the offence came not
And dear Emma too
I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her
But I hope she is pretty well sir
I do not know but that the place agrees with her tolerably
Mr John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls
I have been always telling you my love that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended and now you have Emma s account I hope you will be satisfied
You and I Emma will venture to take the part of the poor husband
He has not been here yet replied Emma
But you should tell them of the letter my dear said her father
Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr Weston and had half a mind to take it up but she struggled and let it pass
She would keep the peace if possible and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits the all sufficiency of home to himself whence resulted her brother s disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse and those to whom it was important
