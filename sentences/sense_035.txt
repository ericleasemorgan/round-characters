Elinor s curiosity to see Mrs Ferrars was satisfied
She wondered that Lucy s spirits could be so very much elevated by the civility of Mrs Ferrars that her interest and her vanity should so very much blind her as to make the attention which seemed only paid her because she was _ not Elinor _ appear a compliment to herself or to allow her to derive encouragement from a preference only given her because her real situation was unknown
But that it was so had not only been declared by Lucy s eyes at the time but was declared over again the next morning more openly for at her particular desire Lady Middleton set her down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing Elinor alone to tell her how happy she was
Elinor wished to talk of something else but Lucy still pressed her to own that she had reason for her happiness and Elinor was obliged to go on
Undoubtedly if they had known your engagement said she nothing could be more flattering than their treatment of you but as that was not the case I guessed you would say so replied Lucy quickly but there was no reason in the world why Mrs Ferrars should seem to like me if she did not and her liking me is every thing
To this Elinor had no answer to make and did not attempt any
Elinor tried to make a civil answer though doubting her own success
But Elinor would not give her any encouragement to hope that she _ should _ tell her sister
Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph by the door s being thrown open the servant s announcing Mr Ferrars and Edward s immediately walking in
But Elinor had more to do and so anxious was she for his sake and her own to do it well that she forced herself after a moment s recollection to welcome him with a look and manner that were almost easy and almost open and another struggle another effort still improved them
She would not allow the presence of Lucy nor the consciousness of some injustice towards herself to deter her from saying that she was happy to see him and that she had very much regretted being from home when he called before in Berkeley Street
Her manners gave some re assurance to Edward and he had courage enough to sit down but his embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in a proportion which the case rendered reasonable though his sex might make it rare for his heart had not the indifference of Lucy s nor could his conscience have quite the ease of Elinor s
Lucy with a demure and settled air seemed determined to make no contribution to the comfort of the others and would not say a word and almost every thing that _ was _ said proceeded from Elinor who was obliged to volunteer all the information about her mother s health their coming to town c which Edward ought to have inquired about but never did
Her exertions did not stop here for she soon afterwards felt herself so heroically disposed as to determine under pretence of fetching Marianne to leave the others by themselves and she really did it and _ that _ in the handsomest manner for she loitered away several minutes on the landing place with the most high minded fortitude before she went to her sister
Elinor is well you see
I think Elinor she presently added we must employ Edward to take care of us in our return to Barton
Elinor was very angry but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the sting for she calmly replied Not so indeed for seriously speaking I am very sure that conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street
Marianne looked at her steadily and said You know Elinor that this is a kind of talking which I can not bear
She then left the room and Elinor dared not follow her to say more for bound as she was by her promise of secrecy to Lucy she could give no information that would convince Marianne and painful as the consequences of her still continuing in an error might be she was obliged to submit to it
