But it was neither in Elinor s power nor in her wish to rouse such feelings in another by her retailed explanation as had at first been called forth in herself
Reflection had given calmness to her judgment and sobered her own opinion of Willoughby s deserts she wished therefore to declare only the simple truth and lay open such facts as were really due to his character without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray
Mrs Dashwood would have interrupted her instantly with soothing tenderness had not Elinor who really wished to hear her sister s unbiased opinion by an eager sign engaged her silence
Marianne slowly continued It is a great relief to me what Elinor told me this morning I have now heard exactly what I wished to hear
For some moments her voice was lost but recovering herself she added and with greater calmness than before I am now perfectly satisfied I wish for no change
I never could have been happy with him after knowing as sooner or later I must have known all this
I know it I know it cried her mother
You consider the matter said Elinor exactly as a good mind and a sound understanding must consider it and I dare say you perceive as well as myself not only in this but in many other circumstances reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you in many certain troubles and disappointments in which you would have been poorly supported by an affection on his side much less certain
The whole of his behaviour replied Elinor from the beginning to the end of the affair has been grounded on selfishness
At present continued Elinor he regrets what he has done
Marianne would not let her proceed and Elinor satisfied that each felt their own error wished to avoid any survey of the past that might weaken her sister s spirits she therefore pursuing the first subject immediately continued _ One _ observation may I think be fairly drawn from the whole of the story that all Willoughby s difficulties have arisen from the first offence against virtue in his behaviour to Eliza Williams
Elinor according to her expectation saw on the two or three following days that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she had done but while her resolution was unsubdued and she still tried to appear cheerful and easy her sister could safely trust to the effect of time upon her health
Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward
She had heard nothing of him since her leaving London nothing new of his plans nothing certain even of his present abode
Some letters had passed between her and her brother in consequence of Marianne s illness and in the first of John s there had been this sentence We know nothing of our unfortunate Edward and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a subject but conclude him to be still at Oxford which was all the intelligence of Edward afforded her by the correspondence for his name was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters
Marianne gave a violent start fixed her eyes upon Elinor saw her turning pale and fell back in her chair in hysterics
Mrs Dashwood whose eyes as she answered the servant s inquiry had intuitively taken the same direction was shocked to perceive by Elinor s countenance how much she really suffered and a moment afterwards alike distressed by Marianne s situation knew not on which child to bestow her principal attention
By that time Marianne was rather better and her mother leaving her to the care of Margaret and the maid returned to Elinor who though still much disordered had so far recovered the use of her reason and voice as to be just beginning an inquiry of Thomas as to the source of his intelligence
Mrs Dashwood immediately took all that trouble on herself and Elinor had the benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it
Elinor s heart could easily account for his not putting himself forward and Mrs Dashwood probably found the same explanation
Mrs Dashwood now looked at her daughter but Elinor knew better than to expect them
She recognised the whole of Lucy in the message and was very confident that Edward would never come near them
Elinor looked as if she wished to hear more
Mrs Dashwood s and Elinor s appetites were equally lost and Margaret might think herself very well off that with so much uneasiness as both her sisters had lately experienced so much reason as they had often had to be careless of their meals she had never been obliged to go without her dinner before
When the dessert and the wine were arranged and Mrs Dashwood and Elinor were left by themselves they remained long together in a similarity of thoughtfulness and silence
She now found that she had erred in relying on Elinor s representation of herself and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at the time to spare her from an increase of unhappiness suffering as she then had suffered for Marianne
She feared that under this persuasion she had been unjust inattentive nay almost unkind to her Elinor that Marianne s affliction because more acknowledged more immediately before her had too much engrossed her tenderness and led her away to forget that in Elinor she might have a daughter suffering almost as much certainly with less self provocation and greater fortitude
