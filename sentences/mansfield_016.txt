The room had then become useless and for some time was quite deserted except by Fanny when she visited her plants or wanted one of the books which she was still glad to keep there from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above but gradually as her value for the comforts of it increased she had added to her possessions and spent more of her time there and having nothing to oppose her had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it that it was now generally admitted to be hers
Can you Fanny
Does it not strike you so Fanny
It must be a great relief to her said Fanny trying for greater warmth of manner
She never appeared more amiable than in her behaviour to you last night
It gave her a very strong claim on my goodwill
She _ was _ very kind indeed and I am glad to have her spared She could not finish the generous effusion
Her conscience stopt her in the middle but Edmund was satisfied
And now dear Fanny I will not interrupt you any longer
