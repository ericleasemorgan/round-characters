His departure gave Catherine the first experimental conviction that a loss may be sometimes a gain
The happiness with which their time now passed every employment voluntary every laugh indulged every meal a scene of ease and good humour walking where they liked and when they liked their hours pleasures and fatigues at their own command made her thoroughly sensible of the restraint which the general s presence had imposed and most thankfully feel their present release from it
Such ease and such delights made her love the place and the people more and more every day and had it not been for a dread of its soon becoming expedient to leave the one and an apprehension of not being equally beloved by the other she would at each moment of each day have been perfectly happy but she was now in the fourth week of her visit before the general came home the fourth week would be turned and perhaps it might seem an intrusion if she stayed much longer
This was a painful consideration whenever it occurred and eager to get rid of such a weight on her mind she very soon resolved to speak to Eleanor about it at once propose going away and be guided in her conduct by the manner in which her proposal might be taken
Aware that if she gave herself much time she might feel it difficult to bring forward so unpleasant a subject she took the first opportunity of being suddenly alone with Eleanor and of Eleanor s being in the middle of a speech about something very different to start forth her obligation of going away very soon
Catherine explained Oh
As long as she was happy they would always be satisfied
Then why might she ask in such a hurry herself to leave them
Because she had been there so long
And it was directly settled that till she had her leaving them was not even to be thought of
Catherine walked on to her chamber making up her mind as well as she could to a further acquaintance with Captain Tilney and comforting herself under the unpleasant impression his conduct had given her and the persuasion of his being by far too fine a gentleman to approve of her that at least they should not meet under such circumstances as would make their meeting materially painful
She trusted he would never speak of Miss Thorpe and indeed as he must by this time be ashamed of the part he had acted there could be no danger of it and as long as all mention of Bath scenes were avoided she thought she could behave to him very civilly
At that moment Catherine thought she heard her step in the gallery and listened for its continuance but all was silent
Scarcely however had she convicted her fancy of error when the noise of something moving close to her door made her start it seemed as if someone was touching the very doorway and in another moment a slight motion of the lock proved that some hand must be on it
She trembled a little at the idea of anyone s approaching so cautiously but resolving not to be again overcome by trivial appearances of alarm or misled by a raised imagination she stepped quietly forward and opened the door
Catherine s spirits however were tranquillized but for an instant for Eleanor s cheeks were pale and her manner greatly agitated
Catherine supposing some uneasiness on Captain Tilney s account could only express her concern by silent attention obliged her to be seated rubbed her temples with lavender water and hung over her with affectionate solicitude
My dear Catherine you must not you must not indeed were Eleanor s first connected words
A new idea now darted into Catherine s mind and turning as pale as her friend she exclaimed T is a messenger from Woodston
His unlooked for return was enough in itself to make Catherine s heart sink and for a few moments she hardly supposed there were anything worse to be told
She said nothing and Eleanor endeavouring to collect herself and speak with firmness but with eyes still cast down soon went on
My dear Catherine we are to part
My dear Eleanor cried Catherine suppressing her feelings as well as she could do not be so distressed
It will not be in my power Catherine
Eleanor made no answer and Catherine s thoughts recurring to something more directly interesting she added thinking aloud Monday so soon as Monday and you _ all _ go
Ah Catherine
Catherine sat down breathless and speechless
Dear dear Catherine in being the bearer of such a message I seem guilty myself of all its insult yet I trust you will acquit me for you must have been long enough in this house to see that I am but a nominal mistress of it that my real power is nothing
said Catherine in a faltering voice
It was with pain that Catherine could speak at all and it was only for Eleanor s sake that she attempted it
Catherine s swelling heart needed relief
Eleanor had wished to spare her from so painful a notion but Catherine could not believe it possible that any injury or any misfortune could provoke such ill will against a person not connected or at least not supposed to be connected with it
That room in which her disturbed imagination had tormented her on her first arrival was again the scene of agitated spirits and unquiet slumbers
Yet how different now the source of her inquietude from what it had been then how mournfully superior in reality and substance
Her anxiety had foundation in fact her fears in probability and with a mind so occupied in the contemplation of actual and natural evil the solitude of her situation the darkness of her chamber the antiquity of the building were felt and considered without the smallest emotion and though the wind was high and often produced strange and sudden noises throughout the house she heard it all as she lay awake hour after hour without curiosity or terror
Catherine had not loitered she was almost dressed and her packing almost finished
The possibility of some conciliatory message from the general occurred to her as his daughter appeared
Very little passed between them on meeting each found her greatest safety in silence and few and trivial were the sentences exchanged while they remained upstairs Catherine in busy agitation completing her dress and Eleanor with more goodwill than experience intent upon filling the trunk
When everything was done they left the room Catherine lingering only half a minute behind her friend to throw a parting glance on every well known cherished object and went down to the breakfast parlour where breakfast was prepared
She tried to eat as well to save herself from the pain of being urged as to make her friend comfortable but she had no appetite and could not swallow many mouthfuls
The contrast between this and her last breakfast in that room gave her fresh misery and strengthened her distaste for everything before her
With what cheerful ease what happy though false security had she then looked around her enjoying everything present and fearing little in future beyond Henry s going to Woodston for a day
For Henry had been there Henry had sat by her and helped her
These reflections were long indulged undisturbed by any address from her companion who sat as deep in thought as herself and the appearance of the carriage was the first thing to startle and recall them to the present moment
Catherine s colour rose at the sight of it and the indignity with which she was treated striking at that instant on her mind with peculiar force made her for a short time sensible only of resentment
You _ must _ write to me Catherine she cried you _ must _ let me hear from you as soon as possible
But this with the look of sorrow accompanying it was enough to melt Catherine s pride in a moment and she instantly said Oh Eleanor I _ will _ write to you indeed
It had occurred to her that after so long an absence from home Catherine might not be provided with money enough for the expenses of her journey and upon suggesting it to her with most affectionate offers of accommodation it proved to be exactly the case
Catherine had never thought on the subject till that moment but upon examining her purse was convinced that but for this kindness of her friend she might have been turned from the house without even the means of getting home and the distress in which she must have been thereby involved filling the minds of both scarcely another word was said by either during the time of their remaining together
The carriage was soon announced to be ready and Catherine instantly rising a long and affectionate embrace supplied the place of language in bidding each other adieu and as they entered the hall unable to leave the house without some mention of one whose name had not yet been spoken by either she paused a moment and with quivering lips just made it intelligible that she left her kind remembrance for her absent friend
But with this approach to his name ended all possibility of restraining her feelings and hiding her face as well as she could with her handkerchief she darted across the hall jumped into the chaise and in a moment was driven from the door
