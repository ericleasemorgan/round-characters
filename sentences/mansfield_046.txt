Lady Bertram could think nothing less and Fanny shared her aunt s security till she received a few lines from Edmund written purposely to give her a clearer idea of his brother s situation and acquaint her with the apprehensions which he and his father had imbibed from the physician with respect to some strong hectic symptoms which seemed to seize the frame on the departure of the fever
Easter came particularly late this year as Fanny had most sorrowfully considered on first learning that she had no chance of leaving Portsmouth till after it
It came and she had yet heard nothing of her return nothing even of the going to London which was to precede her return
Her aunt often expressed a wish for her but there was no notice no message from the uncle on whom all depended
She supposed he could not yet leave his son but it was a cruel a terrible delay to her
The end of April was coming on it would soon be almost three months instead of two that she had been absent from them all and that her days had been passing in a state of penance which she loved them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand and who could yet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her
Her eagerness her impatience her longings to be with them were such as to bring a line or two of Cowper s Tirocinium for ever before her
With what intense desire she wants her home was continually on her tongue as the truest description of a yearning which she could not suppose any schoolboy s bosom to feel more keenly
When she had been coming to Portsmouth she had loved to call it her home had been fond of saying that she was going home the word had been very dear to her and so it still was but it must be applied to Mansfield
They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of her secret meditations and nothing was more consolatory to her than to find her aunt using the same language I can not but say I much regret your being from home at this distressing time so very trying to my spirits
I trust and hope and sincerely wish you may never be absent from home so long again were most delightful sentences to her
Still however it was her private regale
Delicacy to her parents made her careful not to betray such a preference of her uncle s house
For a great while it was so but at last the longing grew stronger it overthrew caution and she found herself talking of what she should do when she went home before she was aware
She reproached herself coloured and looked fearfully towards her father and mother
She need not have been uneasy
There was no sign of displeasure or even of hearing her
She was as welcome to wish herself there as to be there
It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her that she had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had been so dwelt on
It was weeks since she had heard anything of Miss Crawford or of her other connexions in town except through Mansfield and she was beginning to suppose that she might never know whether Mr Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met and might never hear from his sister any more this spring when the following letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations Forgive me my dear Fanny as soon as you can for my long silence and behave as if you could forgive me directly
