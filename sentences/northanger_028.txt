27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella _ Bath April _ My dearest Catherine I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner
Lose no time my dearest sweetest Catherine in writing to him and to me Who ever am etc
Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine
Its inconsistencies contradictions and falsehood struck her from the very first
She was ashamed of Isabella and ashamed of having ever loved her
Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty and her demands impudent
Write to James on her behalf
Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness
She resolved on not answering Isabella s letter and tried to think no more of it
