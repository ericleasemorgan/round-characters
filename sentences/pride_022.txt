Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her
It keeps him in good humour said she and I am more obliged to you than I can express
This was very amiable but Charlotte s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of Mr Collins s addresses by engaging them towards herself
Elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation
She resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged Mr Collins when he returned to Longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family
As for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin Elizabeth
Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of the day before
The possibility of Mr Collins s fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or two but that Charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out Engaged to Mr Collins
But Elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness
Elizabeth quietly answered Undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family
Charlotte did not stay much longer and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard
It was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match
She had always felt that Charlotte s opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage
