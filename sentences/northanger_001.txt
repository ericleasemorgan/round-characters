1 No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy would have supposed her born to be an heroine
Her situation in life the character of her father and mother her own person and disposition were all equally against her
Her father was a clergyman without being neglected or poor and a very respectable man though his name was Richard and he had never been handsome
Her mother was a woman of useful plain sense with a good temper and what is more remarkable with a good constitution
She had three sons before Catherine was born and instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world as anybody might expect she still lived on lived to have six children more to see them growing up around her and to enjoy excellent health herself
A family of ten children will be always called a fine family where there are heads and arms and legs enough for the number but the Morlands had little other right to the word for they were in general very plain and Catherine for many years of her life as plain as any
She had a thin awkward figure a sallow skin without colour dark lank hair and strong features so much for her person and not less unpropitious for heroism seemed her mind
She was fond of all boy s plays and greatly preferred cricket not merely to dolls but to the more heroic enjoyments of infancy nursing a dormouse feeding a canary bird or watering a rose bush
Indeed she had no taste for a garden and if she gathered flowers at all it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief at least so it was conjectured from her always preferring those which she was forbidden to take
Such were her propensities her abilities were quite as extraordinary
She never could learn or understand anything before she was taught and sometimes not even then for she was often inattentive and occasionally stupid
Her mother was three months in teaching her only to repeat the Beggar s Petition and after all her next sister Sally could say it better than she did
Not that Catherine was always stupid by no means she learnt the fable of The Hare and Many Friends as quickly as any girl in England
Her mother wished her to learn music and Catherine was sure she should like it for she was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet so at eight years old she began
She learnt a year and could not bear it and Mrs Morland who did not insist on her daughters being accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste allowed her to leave off
The day which dismissed the music master was one of the happiest of Catherine s life
Her taste for drawing was not superior though whenever she could obtain the outside of a letter from her mother or seize upon any other odd piece of paper she did what she could in that way by drawing houses and trees hens and chickens all very much like one another
Writing and accounts she was taught by her father French by her mother her proficiency in either was not remarkable and she shirked her lessons in both whenever she could
for with all these symptoms of profligacy at ten years old she had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper was seldom stubborn scarcely ever quarrelsome and very kind to the little ones with few interruptions of tyranny she was moreover noisy and wild hated confinement and cleanliness and loved nothing so well in the world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house
Such was Catherine Morland at ten
At fifteen appearances were mending she began to curl her hair and long for balls her complexion improved her features were softened by plumpness and colour her eyes gained more animation and her figure more consequence
Her love of dirt gave way to an inclination for finery and she grew clean as she grew smart she had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her father and mother remark on her personal improvement
Catherine grows quite a good looking girl she is almost pretty today were words which caught her ears now and then and how welcome were the sounds
Mrs Morland was a very good woman and wished to see her children everything they ought to be but her time was so much occupied in lying in and teaching the little ones that her elder daughters were inevitably left to shift for themselves and it was not very wonderful that Catherine who had by nature nothing heroic about her should prefer cricket baseball riding on horseback and running about the country at the age of fourteen to books or at least books of information for provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be gained from them provided they were all story and no reflection she had never any objection to books at all
But from fifteen to seventeen she was in training for a heroine she read all such works as heroines must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful lives
From Pope she learnt to censure those who bear about the mockery of woe
And from Shakespeare she gained a great store of information amongst the rest that Trifles light as air Are to the jealous confirmation strong As proofs of Holy Writ
Mr and Mrs Morland were all compliance and Catherine all happiness
