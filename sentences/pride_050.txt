Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make Mr Darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot
She had no fear of its spreading farther through his means
There were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sister s frailty would have mortified her so much not however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them
But Jane and Elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sister s feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at Longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished
Elizabeth was surprised however that Wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes
