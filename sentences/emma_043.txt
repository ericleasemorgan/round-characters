Emma and Harriet went together Miss Bates and her niece with the Eltons the gentlemen on horseback
The Eltons walked together Mr Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill
At first it was downright dulness to Emma
She had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid
He said nothing worth hearing looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without knowing what she said
To amuse her and be agreeable in her eyes seemed all that he cared for and Emma glad to be enlivened not sorry to be flattered was gay and easy too and gave him all the friendly encouragement the admission to be gallant which she had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance but which now in her own estimation meant nothing though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe
Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity it was rather because she felt less happy than she had expected
She laughed because she was disappointed and though she liked him for his attentions and thought them all whether in friendship admiration or playfulness extremely judicious they were not winning back her heart
She still intended him for her friend
no no cried Emma laughing as carelessly as she could Upon no account in the world
It will not do whispered Frank to Emma they are most of them affronted
Emma could not resist
No no said Emma it will not reckon low
You to Emma I am certain will never guess
It might be a very indifferent piece of wit but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did Frank and Harriet
turning to Emma
Emma was in no danger of forgetting
Mr Weston his son Emma and Harriet only remained and the young man s spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant
Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others or sitting almost alone and quite unattended to in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her
He looked around as if to see that no one were near and then said Emma I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do a privilege rather endured than allowed perhaps but I must still use it
Emma I had not thought it possible
Emma recollected blushed was sorry but tried to laugh it off
I dare say she did not understand me
I assure you she did
She felt your full meaning
She has talked of it since
I wish you could have heard how she talked of it with what candour and generosity
I wish you could have heard her honouring your forbearance in being able to pay her such attentions as she was for ever receiving from yourself and your father when her society must be so irksome
cried Emma I know there is not a better creature in the world but you must allow that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her
They are blended said he I acknowledge and were she prosperous I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good
Were she a woman of fortune I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner
Were she your equal in situation but Emma consider how far this is from being the case
She is poor she has sunk from the comforts she was born to and if she live to old age must probably sink more
Her situation should secure your compassion
You whom she had known from an infant whom she had seen grow up from a period when her notice was an honour to have you now in thoughtless spirits and the pride of the moment laugh at her humble her and before her niece too and before others many of whom certainly some would be entirely guided by your treatment of her
This is not pleasant to you Emma and it is very far from pleasant to me but I must I will I will tell you truths while I can satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now
While they talked they were advancing towards the carriage it was ready and before she could speak again he had handed her in
He had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her face averted and her tongue motionless
She had not been able to speak and on entering the carriage sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave making no acknowledgment parting in apparent sullenness she looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference but it was just too late
She continued to look back but in vain and soon with what appeared unusual speed they were half way down the hill and every thing left far behind
She was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she could conceal
Never had she felt so agitated mortified grieved at any circumstance in her life
She was most forcibly struck
She felt it at her heart
How could she have been so brutal so cruel to Miss Bates
There was only Harriet who seemed not in spirits herself fagged and very willing to be silent and Emma felt the tears running down her cheeks almost all the way home without being at any trouble to check them extraordinary as they were
