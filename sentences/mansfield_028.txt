XXVIII Her uncle and both her aunts were in the drawing room when Fanny went down
To the former she was an interesting object and he saw with pleasure the general elegance of her appearance and her being in remarkably good looks
The neatness and propriety of her dress was all that he would allow himself to commend in her presence but upon her leaving the room again soon afterwards he spoke of her beauty with very decided praise
From a variety of causes she was happy and she was soon made still happier for in following her aunts out of the room Edmund who was holding open the door said as she passed him You must dance with me Fanny you must keep two dances for me any two that you like except the first
She had nothing more to wish for
She had hardly ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her life
Her cousins former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer surprising to her she felt it to be indeed very charming and was actually practising her steps about the drawing room as long as she could be safe from the notice of her aunt Norris who was entirely taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which the butler had prepared
When the company were moving into the ballroom she found herself for the first time near Miss Crawford whose eyes and smiles were immediately and more unequivocally directed as her brother s had been and who was beginning to speak on the subject when Fanny anxious to get the story over hastened to give the explanation of the second necklace the real chain
Not but that she was really pleased to have Fanny admired but she was so much more struck with her own kindness in sending Chapman to her that she could not get it out of her head
But with _ you _ Fanny there may be peace
