The expense need not be any impediment . If I were you , I should not think of the expense . I would have everything done in the best style , and made as nice as possible . Such a place as Sotherton Court deserves everything that taste and money can do . You have space to work upon there , and grounds that will well reward you . For my own part , if I had anything within the fiftieth part of the size of Sotherton , I should be always planting and improving , for naturally I am excessively fond of it . It would be too ridiculous for me to attempt anything where I am now , with my little half acre . It would be quite a burlesque . But if I had more room , I should take a prodigious delight in improving and planting . We did a vast deal in that way at the Parsonage : we made it quite a different place from what it was when we first had it . You young ones do not remember much about it , perhaps ; but if dear Sir Thomas were here , he could tell you what improvements we made : and a great deal more would have been done , but for poor Mr. Norris \u2019s sad state of health . He could hardly ever get out , poor man , to enjoy anything , and _ that _ disheartened me from doing several things that Sir Thomas and I used to talk of . If it had not been for _ that _ , we should have carried on the garden wall , and made the plantation to shut out the churchyard , just as Dr. Grant has done .
