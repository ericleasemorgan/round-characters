Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates . She had been quite overlooked by her cousins ; and as her own opinion of her claims on Sir Thomas \u2019s affection was much too humble to give her any idea of classing herself with his children , she was glad to remain behind and gain a little breathing - time . Her agitation and alarm exceeded all that was endured by the rest , by the right of a disposition which not even innocence could keep from suffering . She was nearly fainting : all her former habitual dread of her uncle was returning , and with it compassion for him and for almost every one of the party on the development before him , with solicitude on Edmund \u2019s account indescribable . She had found a seat , where in excessive trembling she was enduring all these fearful thoughts , while the other three , no longer under any restraint , were giving vent to their feelings of vexation , lamenting over such an unlooked - for premature arrival as a most untoward event , and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been twice as long on his passage , or were still in Antigua . The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates , from better understanding the family , and judging more clearly of the mischief that must ensue . The ruin of the play was to them a certainty : they felt the total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand ; while Mr. Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption , a disaster for the evening , and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal being renewed after tea , when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were over , and he might be at leisure to be amused by it . The Crawfords laughed at the idea ; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves , proposed Mr. Yates \u2019s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage . But Mr. Yates , having never been with those who thought much of parental claims , or family confidence , could not perceive that anything of the kind was necessary ; and therefore , thanking them , said , \" ","i":492},{"w":"\" particular friend , \" ","i":3347}],"patient":[{"w":"proposed","i":882},{"w":"received","i":3294}],"g":2,"id":9,"poss":[{"w":"respects","i":945},{"w":"bow","i":3180},{"w":"family","i":3331},{"w":"introduction","i":3343},{"w":"son","i":3359},{"w":"habits","i":3842},{"w":"friend","i":3965}]},{"agent":[{"w":"be","i":843},{"w":"was","i":1120},{"w":"led","i":1250},{"w":"spoke","i":1276},{"w":"inquired","i":1317},{"w":"had","i":1434},{"w":"came","i":1519},{"w":"sat","i":1568},{"w":"did","i":1608},{"w":"liking","i":1677},{"w":"listened","i":1690},{"w":"sought","i":2047},{"w":"consented","i":2147},{"w":"declined","i":2175},{"w":"take","i":2181},{"w":"wait","i":2191},{"w":"said","i":2742},{"w":"found","i":2749},{"w":"be","i":2752},{"w":"find","i":2789},{"w":"had","i":2989},{"w":"know","i":3028},{"w":"stepped","i":3042},{"w":"given","i":3108},{"w":"found","i":3134},{"w":"received","i":3291},{"w":"exerted","i":3571},{"w":"sat","i":3642},{"w":"lead","i":3765},{"w":"mingled","i":3771},{"w":"hear","i":3807},{"w":"listened","i":3819},{"w":"looked","i":4082},{"w":"were","i":4266},{"w":"added","i":4394},{"w":"said","i":4419},{"w":"understand","i":4557},{"w":"looked","i":4645},{"w":"meant","i":4773},{"w":"find","i":4786},{"w":"expect","i":4795}],"NNPcount":34,"names":[{"c":34,"n":"Thomas"}],"mod":[{"w":"life","i":1414},{"w":"ready","i":1482},{"w":"thing","i":2249},{"w":"deal","i":2932},{"w":"aware","i":4791}],"speaking":[{"w":"\" I come from your theatre , \" ","i":3629},{"w":"\" Mr. Yates was still talking . \" ","i":4252},{"w":"\" My indulgence shall be given , sir , \" ","i":4365}],"patient":[{"w":"wishing","i":731},{"w":"receiving","i":838},{"w":"justified","i":1302},{"w":"wished","i":1616},{"w":"liking","i":1680},{"w":"see","i":1711},{"w":"provoked","i":2275},{"w":"gone","i":2775},{"w":"prepare","i":2785},{"w":"struck","i":2985},{"w":"perceiving","i":3099},{"w":"save","i":3388},{"w":"keep","i":3784},{"w":"torment","i":3794},{"w":"told","i":3989},{"w":"prevented","i":4056},{"w":"felt","i":4112},{"w":"replied","i":4377}],"g":2,"id":10,"poss":[{"w":"affection","i":567},{"w":"children","i":583},{"w":"passage","i":738},{"w":"Fanny","i":1167},{"w":"life","i":1218},{"w":"manner","i":1221},{"w":"voice","i":1226},{"w":"dignity","i":1243},{"w":"belief","i":1306},{"w":"suggestion","i":1425},{"w":"sensations","i":1448},{"w":"house","i":1454},{"w":"family","i":1462},{"w":"voyage","i":1491},{"w":"sons","i":1499},{"w":"business","i":1508},{"w":"thither","i":1531},{"w":"proceedings","i":1552},{"w":"arrivals","i":1557},{"w":"fortune","i":1595},{"w":"wife","i":1701},{"w":"arrival","i":1720},{"w":"disapprobation","i":1938},{"w":"house","i":1946},{"w":"wife","i":2061},{"w":"arrival","i":2103},{"w":"death","i":2106},{"w":"passage","i":2215},{"w":"recital","i":2235},{"w":"answer","i":2298},{"w":"narrative","i":2350},{"w":"communications","i":2362},{"w":"room","i":2765},{"w":"disappearance","i":2800},{"w":"room","i":2944},{"w":"eye","i":2950},{"w":"rehearsals","i":3117},{"w":"countenance","i":3140},{"w":"father","i":3143},{"w":"appearance","i":3153},{"w":"character","i":3305},{"w":"house","i":3397},{"w":"meaning","i":3750},{"w":"disappointment","i":3813},{"w":"ideas","i":3829},{"w":"opinion","i":3836},{"w":"friends","i":4034},{"w":"eyes","i":4067},{"w":"contract","i":4076},{"w":"daughters","i":4088},{"w":"heart","i":4116},{"w":"look","i":4192},{"w":"opinion","i":4873},{"w":"best","i":4885}]},{"agent":[{"w":"joined","i":373},{"w":"feeling","i":2832}],"NNPcount":2,"names":[{"c":2,"n":"Maria"}],"mod":[],"speaking":[{"w":"\" It is time to think of our visitors , \" ","i":2820}],"patient":[],"g":1,"id":11,"poss":[{"w":"hand","i":2836}]},{"agent":[{"w":"whisked","i":1968},{"w":"felt","i":2088},{"w":"depended","i":2097},{"w":"gone","i":2153},{"w":"burst","i":2232}],"NNPcount":4,"names":[{"c":4,"n":"Mrs. Norris"}],"mod":[],"speaking":[],"patient":[{"w":"said","i":1987},{"w":"vexed","i":2000}],"g":1,"id":12,"poss":[{"w":"sister","i":1923},{"w":"judgment","i":1953},{"w":"brother","i":1979},{"w":"nothing","i":2015}]}],"id":"mansfield_019"}
