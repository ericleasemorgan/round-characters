sense_039	2	58	2	3	3	5	she began however seriously to turn her thoughts towards its accomplishment and had already mentioned their wishes to their kind hostess who resisted them with all the eloquence of her good will when a plan was suggested which though detaining them from home yet a few weeks longer appeared to elinor altogether much more eligible than any other

sense_039	11	63	0	0	3	5	this delay on the colonel s side however did not seem to offend or mortify his fair companion in the least for on their breaking up the conference soon afterwards and moving different ways mrs jennings very plainly heard elinor say and with a voice which showed her to feel what she said i shall always think myself very much obliged to you
