pride_018	1	35	2	6	2	6	18 till elizabeth entered the drawing room at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her
pride_018	2	21	0	0	1	5	the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her
pride_018	3	41	0	0	4	10	she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening
pride_018	4	68	3	4	4	6	this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickham s absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make
pride_018	5	69	3	4	4	6	but elizabeth was not formed for ill humour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice
pride_018	6	36	2	6	4	11	mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give
pride_018	7	9	0	0	1	11	the moment of her release from him was ecstasy
pride_018	8	22	1	5	2	9	she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked
pride_018	9	47	3	6	3	6	when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him
pride_018	10	33	3	9	5	15	he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her i dare say you will find him very agreeable
pride_018	11	41	6	15	2	5	elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it
pride_018	12	59	6	10	6	10	they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance
pride_018	13	23	2	9	1	4	after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time with it is  your  turn to say something now mr darcy
pride_018	14	15	2	13	2	13	he smiled and assured her that whatever she wished him to say should be said
pride_018	15	18	3	17	0	0	both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds
pride_018	16	27	2	7	0	0	a deeper shade of  hauteur  overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on
pride_018	17	28	1	4	2	7	he has been so unlucky as to lose  your  friendship replied elizabeth with emphasis and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life
pride_018	18	47	2	4	3	6	his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcy s steward and of  that  i can assure you he informed me himself
pride_018	19	4	0	0	0	0	said elizabeth to herself
pride_018	20	18	1	6	0	0	she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley
pride_018	21	34	0	0	2	6	elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of jane s being in the fairest way for happiness
pride_018	22	24	0	0	3	12	i have not a doubt of mr bingley s sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only
pride_018	23	21	0	0	1	5	she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment
pride_018	24	30	0	0	4	13	elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingley s regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it
pride_018	25	54	4	7	2	4	on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery
pride_018	26	68	4	6	4	6	elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance
pride_018	27	6	1	17	0	0	mr collins then returned to elizabeth
pride_018	28	44	2	5	3	7	as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane
pride_018	29	38	1	3	3	8	she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingley s two sisters
pride_018	30	26	1	4	3	12	her mother s thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much
pride_018	31	58	2	3	5	9	when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley
pride_018	32	49	3	6	1	2	in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mother s words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them
pride_018	33	8	0	0	1	12	her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical
pride_018	34	9	0	0	1	11	elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation
pride_018	35	41	3	7	6	15	she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her
pride_018	36	5	0	0	0	0	elizabeth now began to revive
pride_018	37	34	1	3	4	12	but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company
pride_018	38	65	3	5	5	8	elizabeth s eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another
pride_018	39	4	0	0	1	25	elizabeth was in agonies
pride_018	40	18	2	11	1	6	she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley
pride_018	41	29	0	0	4	14	mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her father s speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good
pride_018	42	80	2	2	4	5	to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed
pride_018	43	42	2	5	3	7	that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable
pride_018	44	9	0	0	0	0	the rest of the evening brought her little amusement
pride_018	45	36	3	8	1	3	she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others
pride_018	46	24	2	8	0	0	in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room
pride_018	47	33	0	0	2	6	elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am
pride_018	48	35	0	0	3	9	elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for  her  the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield
