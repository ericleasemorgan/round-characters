pride_043	81	25	1	4	4	16	there  is  something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming
pride_043	82	7	0	0	1	14	his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling
pride_043	83	35	1	3	1	3	elizabeth excused herself as well as she could said that she had liked him better when they had met in kent than before and that she had never seen him so pleasant as this morning
pride_043	84	14	1	7	1	7	but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle
pride_043	85	12	0	0	1	8	elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his character but said nothing
pride_043	86	72	0	0	4	6	elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickham s so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire
pride_043	87	35	1	3	3	9	in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on
pride_043	88	50	1	2	7	14	the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcy s civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister
