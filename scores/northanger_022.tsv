northanger_022	4	28	2	7	2	7	the sight of it made her start and forgetting everything else she stood gazing on it in motionless wonder while these thoughts crossed her this is strange indeed

northanger_022	7	38	0	0	4	11	she could not in whatever direction she took it believe the last letter to be a  t  and yet that it should be anything else in that house was a circumstance to raise no common degree of astonishment
northanger_022	8	60	0	0	5	8	this ill timed intruder was miss tilney s maid sent by her mistress to be of use to miss morland and though catherine immediately dismissed her it recalled her to the sense of what she ought to be doing and forced her in spite of her anxious desire to penetrate this mystery to proceed in her dressing without further delay
northanger_022	9	45	1	2	3	7	her progress was not quick for her thoughts and her eyes were still bent on the object so well calculated to interest and alarm and though she dared not waste a moment upon a second attempt she could not remain many paces from the chest
northanger_022	10	26	0	0	1	4	at length however having slipped one arm into her gown her toilette seemed so nearly finished that the impatience of her curiosity might safely be indulged
northanger_022	11	31	0	0	3	10	one moment surely might be spared and so desperate should be the exertion of her strength that unless secured by supernatural means the lid in one moment should be thrown back

northanger_022	13	32	0	0	0	0	her resolute effort threw back the lid and gave to her astonished eyes the view of a white cotton counterpane properly folded reposing at one end of the chest in undisputed possession
northanger_022	14	51	2	4	7	14	she was gazing on it with the first blush of surprise when miss tilney anxious for her friend s being ready entered the room and to the rising shame of having harboured for some minutes an absurd expectation was then added the shame of being caught in so idle a search
northanger_022	15	14	3	21	0	0	said miss tilney as catherine hastily closed it and turned away to the glass
northanger_022	16	22	0	0	1	5	catherine had no leisure for speech being at once blushing tying her gown and forming wise resolutions with the most violent dispatch
northanger_022	17	126	4	3	4	3	 catherine trembled at the emphasis with which he spoke and sat pale and breathless in a most humble mood concerned for his children and detesting old chests and the general recovering his politeness as he looked at her spent the rest of his time in scolding his daughter for so foolishly hurrying her fair friend who was absolutely out of breath from haste when there was not the least occasion for hurry in the world but catherine could not at all get over the double distress of having involved her friend in a lecture and been a great simpleton herself till they were happily seated at the dinner table when the general s complacent smiles and a good appetite of her own restored her to peace
northanger_022	18	56	1	2	2	4	the dining parlour was a noble room suitable in its dimensions to a much larger drawing room than the one in common use and fitted up in a style of luxury and expense which was almost lost on the unpractised eye of catherine who saw little more than its spaciousness and the number of their attendants
northanger_022	19	74	2	3	4	5	of the former she spoke aloud her admiration and the general with a very gracious countenance acknowledged that it was by no means an ill sized room and further confessed that though as careless on such subjects as most people he did look upon a tolerably large eating room as one of the necessaries of life he supposed however that she must have been used to much better sized apartments at mr allen s
northanger_022	20	33	1	3	2	6	no indeed was catherine s honest assurance mr allen s dining parlour was not more than half as large and she had never seen so large a room as this in her life
northanger_022	21	47	0	0	5	11	it was only in his presence that catherine felt the smallest fatigue from her journey and even then even in moments of languor or restraint a sense of general happiness preponderated and she could think of her friends in bath without one wish of being with them
northanger_022	22	47	2	4	4	9	catherine as she crossed the hall listened to the tempest with sensations of awe and when she heard it rage round a corner of the ancient building and close with sudden fury a distant door felt for the first time that she was really in an abbey
northanger_022	23	46	1	2	1	2	yes these were characteristic sounds they brought to her recollection a countless variety of dreadful situations and horrid scenes which such buildings had witnessed and such storms ushered in and most heartily did she rejoice in the happier circumstances attending her entrance within walls so solemn
northanger_022	24	11	0	0	0	0	 she  had nothing to dread from midnight assassins or drunken gallants
northanger_022	25	15	1	7	1	7	henry had certainly been only in jest in what he had told her that morning
northanger_022	26	35	1	3	1	3	in a house so furnished and so guarded she could have nothing to explore or to suffer and might go to her bedroom as securely as if it had been her own chamber at fullerton
northanger_022	27	47	2	4	3	6	thus wisely fortifying her mind as she proceeded upstairs she was enabled especially on perceiving that miss tilney slept only two doors from her to enter her room with a tolerably stout heart and her spirits were immediately assisted by the cheerful blaze of a wood fire
northanger_022	28	61	1	2	3	5	the fire therefore died away and catherine having spent the best part of an hour in her arrangements was beginning to think of stepping into bed when on giving a parting glance round the room she was struck by the appearance of a high old fashioned black cabinet which though in a situation conspicuous enough had never caught her notice before
northanger_022	29	41	1	2	4	10	henry s words his description of the ebony cabinet which was to escape her observation at first immediately rushed across her and though there could be nothing really in it there was something whimsical it was certainly a very remarkable coincidence
northanger_022	30	10	1	10	0	0	she took her candle and looked closely at the cabinet
northanger_022	31	34	1	3	2	6	it was not absolutely ebony and gold but it was japan black and yellow japan of the handsomest kind and as she held her candle the yellow had very much the effect of gold
northanger_022	32	36	1	3	4	11	the key was in the door and she had a strange fancy to look into it not however with the smallest expectation of finding anything but it was so very odd after what henry had said
northanger_022	33	11	1	9	0	0	in short she could not sleep till she had examined it
northanger_022	34	30	3	10	0	0	so placing the candle with great caution on a chair she seized the key with a very tremulous hand and tried to turn it but it resisted her utmost strength
northanger_022	35	21	1	5	1	5	alarmed but not discouraged she tried it another way a bolt flew and she believed herself successful but how strangely mysterious
northanger_022	36	7	0	0	1	14	she paused a moment in breathless wonder
northanger_022	37	24	1	4	1	4	the wind roared down the chimney the rain beat in torrents against the windows and everything seemed to speak the awfulness of her situation
northanger_022	38	31	3	10	2	6	to retire to bed however unsatisfied on such a point would be vain since sleep must be impossible with the consciousness of a cabinet so mysteriously closed in her immediate vicinity
northanger_022	39	114	2	2	3	3	again therefore she applied herself to the key and after moving it in every possible way for some instants with the determined celerity of hope s last effort the door suddenly yielded to her hand her heart leaped with exultation at such a victory and having thrown open each folding door the second being secured only by bolts of less wonderful construction than the lock though in that her eye could not discern anything unusual a double range of small drawers appeared in view with some larger drawers above and below them and in the centre a small door closed also with a lock and key secured in all probability a cavity of importance
northanger_022	40	12	0	0	1	8	catherine s heart beat quick but her courage did not fail her
northanger_022	41	24	0	0	1	4	with a cheek flushed by hope and an eye straining with curiosity her fingers grasped the handle of a drawer and drew it forth
northanger_022	42	18	0	0	1	6	with less alarm and greater eagerness she seized a second a third a fourth each was equally empty
northanger_022	43	31	0	0	2	6	well read in the art of concealing a treasure the possibility of false linings to the drawers did not escape her and she felt round each with anxious acuteness in vain
northanger_022	44	57	1	2	5	9	the place in the middle alone remained now unexplored and though she had never from the first had the smallest idea of finding anything in any part of the cabinet and was not in the least disappointed at her ill success thus far it would be foolish not to examine it thoroughly while she was about it
northanger_022	45	70	0	0	4	6	it was some time however before she could unfasten the door the same difficulty occurring in the management of this inner lock as of the outer but at length it did open and not vain as hitherto was her search her quick eyes directly fell on a roll of paper pushed back into the further part of the cavity apparently for concealment and her feelings at that moment were indescribable
northanger_022	46	11	0	0	1	9	her heart fluttered her knees trembled and her cheeks grew pale
northanger_022	47	44	3	7	2	5	she seized with an unsteady hand the precious manuscript for half a glance sufficed to ascertain written characters and while she acknowledged with awful sensations this striking exemplification of what henry had foretold resolved instantly to peruse every line before she attempted to rest
northanger_022	48	55	2	4	1	2	the dimness of the light her candle emitted made her turn to it with alarm but there was no danger of its sudden extinction it had yet some hours to burn and that she might not have any greater difficulty in distinguishing the writing than what its ancient date might occasion she hastily snuffed it
northanger_022	49	9	0	0	1	11	catherine for a few moments was motionless with horror
northanger_022	50	6	0	0	0	0	catherine trembled from head to foot
northanger_022	51	22	0	0	1	5	in the pause which succeeded a sound like receding footsteps and the closing of a distant door struck on her affrighted ear
northanger_022	52	36	1	3	0	0	a cold sweat stood on her forehead the manuscript fell from her hand and groping her way to the bed she jumped hastily in and sought some suspension of agony by creeping far underneath the clothes
northanger_022	53	17	3	18	2	12	to close her eyes in sleep that night she felt must be entirely out of the question
northanger_022	54	19	0	0	3	16	she had not been used to feel alarm from wind but now every blast seemed fraught with awful intelligence
northanger_022	55	14	0	0	0	0	and how singularly strange that it should fall to her lot to discover it
northanger_022	56	30	1	3	2	7	till she had made herself mistress of its contents however she could have neither repose nor comfort and with the sun s first rays she was determined to peruse it
northanger_022	57	12	1	8	0	0	she shuddered tossed about in her bed and envied every quiet sleeper
northanger_022	58	23	1	4	1	4	the storm still raged and various were the noises more terrific even than the wind which struck at intervals on her startled ear
northanger_022	59	31	2	6	2	6	the very curtains of her bed seemed at one moment in motion and at another the lock of her door was agitated as if by the attempt of somebody to enter
northanger_022	60	22	0	0	2	9	hollow murmurs seemed to creep along the gallery and more than once her blood was chilled by the sound of distant moans
northanger_022	61	30	1	3	0	0	hour after hour passed away and the wearied catherine had heard three proclaimed by all the clocks in the house before the tempest subsided or she unknowingly fell fast asleep
