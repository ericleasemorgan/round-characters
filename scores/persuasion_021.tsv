persuasion_021	20	51	1	2	8	16	i should be extremely happy i hope you can not doubt my willingness to be of even the slightest use to you replied anne but i suspect that you are considering me as having a higher claim on mr elliot a greater right to influence him than is really the case

persuasion_021	27	39	2	5	3	8	i have not seen mr elliot these three years was mrs smith s answer given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther and anne felt that she had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity

persuasion_021	36	31	1	3	3	10	such a letter could not be read without putting anne in a glow and mrs smith observing the high colour in her face said the language i know is highly disrespectful
persuasion_021	37	18	1	6	1	6	anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of finding such words applied to her father
persuasion_021	38	62	3	5	5	8	she was obliged to recollect that her seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour that no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies that no private correspondence could bear the eye of others before she could recover calmness enough to return the letter which she had been meditating over and say thank you
persuasion_021	39	116	5	4	5	4	here mrs smith paused a moment but anne had not a word to say and she continued this was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family long before you returned to it and colonel wallis had his eye upon your father enough to be sensible of it though he did not then visit in camden place but his regard for mr elliot gave him an interest in watching all that was going on there and when mr elliot came to bath for a day or two as he happened to do a little before christmas colonel wallis made him acquainted with the appearance of things and the reports beginning to prevail

persuasion_021	44	51	1	2	1	2	anne was shewn some letters of his on the occasion answers to urgent applications from mrs smith which all breathed the same stern resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble and under a cold civility the same hard hearted indifference to any of the evils it might bring on her

persuasion_021	47	26	0	0	2	8	anne could perfectly comprehend the exquisite relief and was only the more inclined to wonder at the composure of her friend s usual state of mind
persuasion_021	48	13	0	0	1	8	there was one circumstance in the history of her grievances of particular irritation
persuasion_021	49	54	1	2	4	7	she had good reason to believe that some property of her husband in the west indies which had been for many years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own incumbrances might be recoverable by proper measures and this property though not large would be enough to make her comparatively rich
persuasion_021	50	31	0	0	1	3	mr elliot would do nothing and she could do nothing herself equally disabled from personal exertion by her state of bodily weakness and from employing others by her want of money
persuasion_021	51	24	0	0	0	0	she had no natural connexions to assist her even with their counsel and she could not afford to purchase the assistance of the law
persuasion_021	52	36	1	3	5	14	to feel that she ought to be in better circumstances that a little trouble in the right place might do it and to fear that delay might be even weakening her claims was hard to bear
persuasion_021	53	18	0	0	2	11	it was on this point that she had hoped to engage anne s good offices with mr elliot
persuasion_021	54	132	5	4	9	7	she had previously in the anticipation of their marriage been very apprehensive of losing her friend by it but on being assured that he could have made no attempt of that nature since he did not even know her to be in bath it immediately occurred that something might be done in her favour by the influence of the woman he loved and she had been hastily preparing to interest anne s feelings as far as the observances due to mr elliot s character would allow when anne s refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of everything and while it took from her the new formed hope of succeeding in the object of her first anxiety left her at least the comfort of telling the whole story her own way
persuasion_021	55	32	1	3	1	3	after listening to this full description of mr elliot anne could not but express some surprise at mrs smith s having spoken of him so favourably in the beginning of their conversation
persuasion_021	56	8	0	0	1	12	she had seemed to recommend and praise him
persuasion_021	57	30	1	3	2	7	anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having been induced to marry him as made her shudder at the idea of the misery which must have followed
persuasion_021	58	13	1	8	2	15	it was just possible that she might have been persuaded by lady russell
persuasion_021	59	54	1	2	5	9	it was very desirable that lady russell should be no longer deceived and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference which carried them through the greater part of the morning was that anne had full liberty to communicate to her friend everything relative to mrs smith in which his conduct was involved
