persuasion_005	6	63	1	2	8	13	to be claimed as a good though in an improper style is at least better than being rejected as no good at all and anne glad to be thought of some use glad to have anything marked out as a duty and certainly not sorry to have the scene of it in the country and her own dear country readily agreed to stay
persuasion_005	7	44	1	2	2	5	this invitation of mary s removed all lady russell s difficulties and it was consequently soon settled that anne should not go to bath till lady russell took her and that all the intervening time should be divided between uppercross cottage and kellynch lodge

persuasion_005	16	65	3	5	4	6	it was painful to look upon their deserted grounds and still worse to anticipate the new hands they were to fall into and to escape the solitariness and the melancholy of so altered a village and be out of the way when admiral and mrs croft first arrived she had determined to make her own absence from home begin when she must give up anne
persuasion_005	17	23	1	4	2	9	accordingly their removal was made together and anne was set down at uppercross cottage in the first stage of lady russell s journey

persuasion_005	20	53	1	2	6	11	the two families were so continually meeting so much in the habit of running in and out of each other s house at all hours that it was rather a surprise to her to find mary alone but being alone her being unwell and out of spirits was almost a matter of course

persuasion_005	28	11	1	9	0	0	i have not the smallest objection on that account replied anne
persuasion_005	29	40	0	0	3	8	anne had always thought such a style of intercourse highly imprudent but she had ceased to endeavour to check it from believing that though there were on each side continual subjects of offence neither family could now do without it
persuasion_005	30	81	0	0	2	2	anne always contemplated them as some of the happiest creatures of her acquaintance but still saved as we all are by some comfortable feeling of superiority from wishing for the possibility of exchange she would not have given up her own more elegant and cultivated mind for all their enjoyments and envied them nothing but that seemingly perfect good understanding and agreement together that good humoured mutual affection of which she had known so little herself with either of her sisters
