emma_005	10	38	1	3	2	5	the list she drew up when only fourteen i remember thinking it did her judgment so much credit that i preserved it some time and i dare say she may have made out a very good list now

emma_005	20	61	0	0	3	5	you might not give emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise but you were receiving a very good education from her on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will and doing as you were bid and if weston had asked me to recommend him a wife i should certainly have named miss taylor

emma_005	45	73	1	1	4	5	i know that you all love her really too well to be unjust or unkind but excuse me mr knightley if i take the liberty i consider myself you know as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that emma s mother might have had the liberty of hinting that i do not think any possible good can arise from harriet smith s intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you
emma_005	46	49	1	2	9	18	pray excuse me but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy it can not be expected that emma accountable to nobody but her father who perfectly approves the acquaintance should put an end to it so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself

emma_005	54	24	0	0	1	4	part of her meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her own and mr weston s on the subject as much as possible
emma_005	55	40	2	5	5	12	there were wishes at randalls respecting emma s destiny but it was not desirable to have them suspected and the quiet transition which mr knightley soon afterwards made to what does weston think of the weather shall we have rain
