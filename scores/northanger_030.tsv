northanger_030	3	55	1	2	3	5	leaning back in one corner of the carriage in a violent burst of tears she was conveyed some miles beyond the walls of the abbey before she raised her head and the highest point of ground within the park was almost closed from her view before she was capable of turning her eyes towards it
northanger_030	4	52	3	6	2	4	unfortunately the road she now travelled was the same which only ten days ago she had so happily passed along in going to and from woodston and for fourteen miles every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects on which she had first looked under impressions so different
northanger_030	5	42	2	5	2	5	every mile as it brought her nearer woodston added to her sufferings and when within the distance of five she passed the turning which led to it and thought of henry so near yet so unconscious her grief and agitation were excessive
northanger_030	6	18	1	6	1	6	the day which she had spent at that place had been one of the happiest of her life
northanger_030	7	43	3	7	4	9	it was there it was on that day that the general had made use of such expressions with regard to henry and herself had so spoken and so looked as to give her the most positive conviction of his actually wishing their marriage
northanger_030	8	23	0	0	1	4	yes only ten days ago had he elated her by his pointed regard had he even confused her by his too significant reference
northanger_030	9	18	0	0	0	0	and now what had she done or what had she omitted to do to merit such a change
northanger_030	10	22	0	0	3	14	the only offence against him of which she could accuse herself had been such as was scarcely possible to reach his knowledge
northanger_030	11	28	0	0	4	14	henry and her own heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she had so idly entertained and equally safe did she believe her secret with each
northanger_030	12	9	0	0	0	0	designedly at least henry could not have betrayed her
northanger_030	13	39	1	3	3	8	if indeed by any strange mischance his father should have gained intelligence of what she had dared to think and look for of her causeless fancies and injurious examinations she could not wonder at any degree of his indignation
northanger_030	14	22	1	5	2	9	if aware of her having viewed him as a murderer she could not wonder at his even turning her from his house
northanger_030	15	17	0	0	2	12	but a justification so full of torture to herself she trusted would not be in his power
northanger_030	16	20	0	0	3	15	anxious as were all her conjectures on this point it was not however the one on which she dwelt most
northanger_030	17	65	4	6	6	9	how henry would think and feel and look when he returned on the morrow to northanger and heard of her being gone was a question of force and interest to rise over every other to be never ceasing alternately irritating and soothing it sometimes suggested the dread of his calm acquiescence and at others was answered by the sweetest confidence in his regret and resentment
northanger_030	18	52	2	4	2	4	but whatever might be the distress of catherine s mind as she thus advanced towards the parsonage and whatever the humiliation of her biographer in relating it she was preparing enjoyment of no everyday nature for those to whom she went first in the appearance of her carriage and secondly in herself
northanger_030	19	7	1	14	0	0	happy the glance that first distinguished catherine
northanger_030	20	53	0	0	4	8	her father mother sarah george and harriet all assembled at the door to welcome her with affectionate eagerness was a sight to awaken the best feelings of catherine s heart and in the embrace of each as she stepped from the carriage she found herself soothed beyond anything that she had believed possible
northanger_030	21	8	0	0	1	12	so surrounded so caressed she was even happy

northanger_030	23	104	1	1	7	7	why he had done it what could have provoked him to such a breach of hospitality and so suddenly turned all his partial regard for their daughter into actual ill will was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as catherine herself but it did not oppress them by any means so long and after a due course of useless conjecture that it was a strange business and that he must be a very strange man grew enough for all their indignation and wonder though sarah indeed still indulged in the sweets of incomprehensibility exclaiming and conjecturing with youthful ardour
northanger_030	24	21	0	0	2	10	i can allow for his wishing catherine away when he recollected this engagement said sarah but why not do it civilly
northanger_030	25	42	1	2	5	12	i am sorry for the young people returned mrs morland they must have a sad time of it but as for anything else it is no matter now catherine is safe at home and our comfort does not depend upon general tilney

northanger_030	27	31	0	0	4	13	well continued her philosophic mother i am glad i did not know of your journey at the time but now it is all over perhaps there is no great harm done
northanger_030	28	69	2	3	5	7	it is always good for young people to be put upon exerting themselves and you know my dear catherine you always were a sad little scatter brained creature but now you must have been forced to have your wits about you with so much changing of chaises and so forth and i hope it will appear that you have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets
northanger_030	29	46	4	9	5	11	catherine hoped so too and tried to feel an interest in her own amendment but her spirits were quite worn down and to be silent and alone becoming soon her only wish she readily agreed to her mother s next counsel of going early to bed
northanger_030	30	68	3	4	6	9	her parents seeing nothing in her ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified feelings and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey parted from her without any doubt of their being soon slept away and though when they all met the next morning her recovery was not equal to their hopes they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being any deeper evil
northanger_030	31	28	1	4	3	11	they never once thought of her heart which for the parents of a young lady of seventeen just returned from her first excursion from home was odd enough
northanger_030	32	68	2	3	4	6	as soon as breakfast was over she sat down to fulfil her promise to miss tilney whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her friend s disposition was already justified for already did catherine reproach herself with having parted from eleanor coldly with having never enough valued her merits or kindness and never enough commiserated her for what she had been yesterday left to endure
northanger_030	33	27	2	7	2	7	the strength of these feelings however was far from assisting her pen and never had it been harder for her to write than in addressing eleanor tilney

northanger_030	37	40	0	0	0	0	her eyes filled with tears as she pictured her acquaintance so renewed and her mother perceiving her comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect proposed as another expedient for restoring her spirits that they should call on mrs allen
northanger_030	38	57	2	4	3	5	this was just such a summary view of the affair as catherine could listen to another sentence might have endangered her complaisance and made her reply less rational for soon were all her thinking powers swallowed up in the reflection of her own change of feelings and spirits since last she had trodden that well known road
northanger_030	39	50	2	4	4	8	it was not three months ago since wild with joyful expectation she had there run backwards and forwards some ten times a day with an heart light gay and independent looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it

northanger_030	41	57	1	2	4	7	she was received by the allens with all the kindness which her unlooked for appearance acting on a steady affection would naturally call forth and great was their surprise and warm their displeasure on hearing how she had been treated though mrs morland s account of it was no inflated representation no studied appeal to their passions
northanger_030	42	10	0	0	0	0	catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening said she

northanger_030	50	39	0	0	2	5	there was a great deal of good sense in all this but there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has very little power and catherine s feelings contradicted almost every position her mother advanced
northanger_030	51	63	1	2	5	8	it was upon the behaviour of these very slight acquaintance that all her present happiness depended and while mrs morland was successfully confirming her own opinions by the justness of her own representations catherine was silently reflecting that  now  henry must have arrived at northanger  now  he must have heard of her departure and  now  perhaps they were all setting off for hereford
