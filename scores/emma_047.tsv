emma_047	2	31	1	3	1	3	frank churchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways but it was not so much his behaviour as her own which made her so angry with him

emma_047	14	30	3	10	3	10	you blushing as she spoke who can see into every body s heart but nobody else upon my word said emma i begin to doubt my having any such talent
emma_047	15	45	3	7	2	4	i am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject replied emma smiling but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him
emma_047	16	11	0	0	0	0	cried emma after a moment s pause what do you mean
emma_047	17	6	2	33	0	0	she could not speak another word
emma_047	18	16	2	12	1	6	her voice was lost and she sat down waiting in great terror till harriet should answer
emma_047	19	35	3	9	2	6	harriet who was standing at some distance and with face turned from her did not immediately say any thing and when she did speak it was in a voice nearly as agitated as emma s
emma_047	20	15	0	0	1	7	i should not have thought it possible she began that you could have misunderstood me
emma_047	21	36	1	3	4	11	i know we agreed never to name him but considering how infinitely superior he is to every body else i should not have thought it possible that i could be supposed to mean any other person

emma_047	27	23	3	13	1	4	emma turned round to look at her in consternation and hastily said have you any idea of mr knightley s returning your affection
emma_047	28	19	1	5	1	5	emma s eyes were instantly withdrawn and she sat silently meditating in a fixed attitude for a few minutes
emma_047	29	13	1	8	2	15	a few minutes were sufficient for making her acquainted with her own heart
emma_047	30	9	0	0	0	0	she touched she admitted she acknowledged the whole truth
emma_047	31	73	3	4	3	4	some portion of respect for herself however in spite of all these demerits some concern for her own appearance and a strong sense of justice by harriet there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by mr knightley but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now gave emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness with even apparent kindness
emma_047	32	55	0	0	6	11	for her own advantage indeed it was fit that the utmost extent of harriet s hopes should be enquired into and harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person whose counsels had never led her right
emma_047	33	21	0	0	3	14	emma s tremblings as she asked and as she listened were better concealed than harriet s but they were not less
emma_047	34	15	0	0	1	7	emma knew that he had on that occasion found her much superior to his expectation
emma_047	35	10	0	0	1	10	emma knew it to have been very much the case
emma_047	36	11	0	0	1	9	she had often observed the change to almost the same extent
emma_047	37	29	2	7	2	7	harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him and emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of harriet
emma_047	38	42	1	2	1	2	much that lived in harriet s memory many little particulars of the notice she had received from him a look a speech a removal from one chair to another a compliment implied a preference inferred had been unnoticed because unsuspected by emma
emma_047	39	54	3	6	2	4	circumstances that might swell to half an hour s relation and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned the two of strongest promise to harriet were not without some degree of witness from emma herself
emma_047	40	69	3	4	3	4	the first was his walking with her apart from the others in the lime walk at donwell where they had been walking some time before emma came and he had taken pains as she was convinced to draw her from the rest to himself and at first he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before in a very particular way indeed
emma_047	41	107	5	5	4	4	but as soon as she miss woodhouse appeared likely to join them he changed the subject and began talking about farming the second was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before emma came back from her visit the very last morning of his being at hartfield though when he first came in he had said that he could not stay five minutes and his having told her during their conversation that though he must go to london it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all which was much more as emma felt than he had acknowledged to her
emma_047	42	62	3	5	3	5	the bitter feelings occasioned by this speech the many bitter feelings made the utmost exertion necessary on emma s side to enable her to say on reply harriet i will only venture to declare that mr knightley is the last man in the world who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his feeling for her more than he really does
emma_047	43	38	0	0	3	8	harriet seemed ready to worship her friend for a sentence so satisfactory and emma was only saved from raptures and fondness which at that moment would have been dreadful penance by the sound of her father s footsteps
emma_047	44	45	3	7	3	7	she could not compose herself mr woodhouse would be alarmed she had better go with most ready encouragement from her friend therefore she passed off through another door and the moment she was gone this was the spontaneous burst of emma s feelings oh god
emma_047	45	6	1	17	0	0	that i had never seen her
emma_047	46	14	0	0	1	7	the rest of the day the following night were hardly enough for her thoughts
emma_047	47	18	0	0	1	6	she was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her within the last few hours
emma_047	48	17	0	0	1	6	every moment had brought a fresh surprize and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her
emma_047	49	15	0	0	1	7	how to understand the deceptions she had been thus practising on herself and living under
emma_047	50	10	0	0	1	10	the blunders the blindness of her own head and heart
emma_047	51	69	5	7	4	6	she sat still she walked about she tried her own room she tried the shrubbery in every place every posture she perceived that she had acted most weakly that she had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree that she had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying that she was wretched and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness
emma_047	52	11	0	0	2	18	to understand thoroughly understand her own heart was the first endeavour
emma_047	53	23	1	4	0	0	to that point went every leisure moment which her father s claims on her allowed and every moment of involuntary absence of mind
emma_047	54	18	1	6	3	17	how long had mr knightley been so dear to her as every feeling declared him now to be
emma_047	55	20	1	5	0	0	when had he succeeded to that place in her affection which frank churchill had once for a short period occupied
emma_047	56	43	2	5	1	2	she looked back she compared the two compared them as they had always stood in her estimation from the time of the latter s becoming known to her and as they must at any time have been compared by her had it oh
emma_047	57	13	0	0	1	8	had it by any blessed felicity occurred to her to institute the comparison
emma_047	58	33	1	3	3	9	she saw that there never had been a time when she did not consider mr knightley as infinitely the superior or when his regard for her had not been infinitely the most dear
emma_047	59	40	2	5	3	8	she saw that in persuading herself in fancying in acting to the contrary she had been entirely under a delusion totally ignorant of her own heart and in short that she had never really cared for frank churchill at all
emma_047	60	22	0	0	4	18	this was the knowledge of herself on the first question of inquiry which she reached and without being long in reaching it
emma_047	61	20	0	0	2	10	she was most sorrowfully indignant ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her her affection for mr knightley
emma_047	62	8	0	0	1	12	every other part of her mind was disgusting
emma_047	63	25	0	0	1	4	with insufferable vanity had she believed herself in the secret of every body s feelings with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body s destiny
emma_047	64	20	0	0	2	10	she was proved to have been universally mistaken and she had not quite done nothing for she had done mischief
emma_047	65	16	0	0	1	6	she had brought evil on harriet on herself and she too much feared on mr knightley
emma_047	66	58	1	2	4	7	were this most unequal of all connexions to take place on her must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning for his attachment she must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of harriet s and even were this not the case he would never have known harriet at all but for her folly
emma_047	67	42	1	2	2	5	it was horrible to emma to think how it must sink him in the general opinion to foresee the smiles the sneers the merriment it would prompt at his expense the mortification and disdain of his brother the thousand inconveniences to himself
