emma_038	1	11	0	0	1	9	no second meeting had there yet been between him and emma
emma_038	2	60	3	5	3	5	mr weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came that she could not refuse him and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man s company
emma_038	3	21	0	0	1	5	she was to convey harriet and they drove to the crown in good time the randalls party just sufficiently before them
emma_038	4	41	3	7	3	7	they all walked about together to see that every thing was as it should be and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage which emma could not hear the sound of at first without great surprize
emma_038	5	78	2	3	12	15	she was going to exclaim but she presently found that it was a family of old friends who were coming like herself by particular desire to help mr weston s judgment and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness on the same errand that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection
emma_038	6	45	0	0	4	9	emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which mr weston depended and felt that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity
emma_038	7	19	1	5	1	5	she liked his open manners but a little less of open heartedness would have made him a higher character
emma_038	8	6	0	0	1	17	she could fancy such a man
emma_038	9	20	0	0	3	15	emma found that it was not mr weston s fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger
emma_038	10	30	1	3	3	10	emma longed to know what frank s first opinion of mrs elton might be how he was affected by the studied elegance of her dress and her smiles of graciousness
emma_038	11	55	3	5	4	7	her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like emma but her words every body s words were soon lost under the incessant flow of miss bates who came in talking and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire
emma_038	12	29	2	7	2	7	must not compliment i know eyeing emma most complacently that would be rude but upon my word miss woodhouse you do look how do you like jane s hair
emma_038	13	37	3	8	3	8	frank churchill returned to his station by emma and as soon as miss bates was quiet she found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of mrs elton and miss fairfax who were standing a little way behind her
emma_038	14	49	0	0	3	6	at this moment frank began talking so vigorously that emma could not but imagine he had overheard his own praises and did not want to hear more and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while till another suspension brought mrs elton s tones again distinctly forward
emma_038	15	5	0	0	0	0	said emma in a whisper
emma_038	16	11	0	0	1	9	emma could hardly understand him he seemed in an odd humour
emma_038	17	15	0	0	1	7	he had met with them in a little perplexity which must be laid before emma
emma_038	18	33	0	0	4	12	it had just occurred to mrs weston that mrs elton must be asked to begin the ball that she would expect it which interfered with all their wishes of giving emma that distinction
emma_038	19	7	0	0	0	0	emma heard the sad truth with fortitude
emma_038	20	12	0	0	1	8	and what are we to do for a proper partner for her
emma_038	21	8	0	0	1	12	she will think frank ought to ask her
emma_038	22	58	4	7	4	7	frank turned instantly to emma to claim her former promise and boasted himself an engaged man which his father looked his most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that mrs weston was wanting him to dance with mrs elton himself and that their business was to help to persuade him into it which was done pretty soon
emma_038	23	20	1	5	0	0	emma must submit to stand second to mrs elton though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her
emma_038	24	39	2	5	3	8	in spite of this little rub however emma was smiling with enjoyment delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her
emma_038	25	15	1	7	1	7	she was more disturbed by mr knightley s not dancing than by any thing else
emma_038	26	49	0	0	4	8	his tall firm upright figure among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men was such as emma felt must draw every body s eyes and excepting her own partner there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him
emma_038	27	17	2	12	1	6	whenever she caught his eye she forced him to smile but in general he was looking grave
emma_038	28	14	0	0	2	14	she wished he could love a ballroom better and could like frank churchill better
emma_038	29	5	0	0	1	20	he seemed often observing her
emma_038	30	23	0	0	3	13	she must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing but if he were criticising her behaviour she did not feel afraid
emma_038	31	10	0	0	2	20	there was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner
emma_038	32	13	0	0	2	15	that frank churchill thought less of her than he had done was indubitable
emma_038	33	9	0	0	2	22	there was one however which emma thought something of
emma_038	34	13	1	8	1	8	but emma s wonder lessened soon afterwards on seeing mr elton sauntering about
emma_038	35	3	1	33	0	0	emma saw it
emma_038	36	33	4	12	2	6	she was not yet dancing she was working her way up from the bottom and had therefore leisure to look around and by only turning her head a little she saw it all
emma_038	37	73	3	4	7	10	when she was half way up the set the whole group were exactly behind her and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch but mr elton was so near that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and mrs weston and she perceived that his wife who was standing immediately above her was not only listening also but even encouraging him by significant glances
emma_038	38	21	1	5	2	10	mrs weston said no more and emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she must be returning to her seat
emma_038	39	33	4	12	1	3	she looked round for a moment he had joined mr knightley at a little distance and was arranging himself for settled conversation while smiles of high glee passed between him and his wife
emma_038	40	13	1	8	1	8	mr elton had retreated into the card room looking emma trusted very foolish
emma_038	41	38	1	3	4	11	she did not think he was quite so hardened as his wife though growing very like her she spoke some of her feelings by observing audibly to her partner knightley has taken pity on poor little miss smith
emma_038	42	33	2	6	2	6	emma had no opportunity of speaking to mr knightley till after supper but when they were all in the ballroom again her eyes invited him irresistibly to come to her and be thanked
emma_038	43	9	0	0	2	22	emma why is it that they are your enemies
emma_038	44	25	4	16	3	12	he looked with smiling penetration and on receiving no answer added she ought not to be angry with you i suspect whatever he may be
emma_038	45	19	0	0	1	5	to that surmise you say nothing of course but confess emma that you did want him to marry harriet
emma_038	46	10	1	10	1	10	i did replied emma and they can not forgive me
emma_038	47	4	0	0	1	25	emma was extremely gratified
emma_038	48	7	0	0	0	0	come emma set your companions the example
emma_038	49	9	0	0	3	33	i am ready said emma whenever i am wanted
emma_038	50	14	1	7	0	0	she hesitated a moment and then replied with you if you will ask me
