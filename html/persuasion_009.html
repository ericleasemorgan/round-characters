<p/>Captain Wentworth was come to Kellynch as to a home, to stay as long as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) liked, being as thoroughly the object of the Admiral's fraternal
kindness as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife's.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had intended, on first arriving, to
proceed very soon into Shropshire, and visit the brother settled in
that country, but the attractions of Uppercross induced him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to put this
off.  There was so much of friendliness, and of flattery, and of
everything most bewitching in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) reception there; the old were so
hospitable, the young so agreeable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could not but resolve to
remain where he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was, and take all the charms and perfections of
Edward's wife upon credit a little longer.

<p/>It was soon Uppercross with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) almost every day.  The Musgroves could
hardly be more ready to invite than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to come, particularly in the
morning, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had no companion at home, for the Admiral and Mrs
Croft were generally out of doors together, interesting themselves in
their new possessions, their grass, and their sheep, and dawdling about
in a way not endurable to a third person, or driving out in a gig,
lately added to their establishment.

<p/>Hitherto there had been but one opinion of Captain Wentworth among the
Musgroves and their dependencies.  It was unvarying, warm admiration
everywhere; but this intimate footing was not more than established,
when a certain Charles Hayter returned among them, to be a good deal
disturbed by it, and to think Captain Wentworth very much in the way.

<p/>Charles Hayter was the eldest of all the cousins, and a very amiable,
pleasing young man, between whom and Henrietta there had been a
considerable appearance of attachment previous to Captain Wentworth's
introduction.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was in orders; and having a curacy in the
neighbourhood, where residence was not required, lived at his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) father's
house, only two miles from Uppercross.  A short absence from home had
left his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) fair one unguarded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) attentions at this critical period,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came back he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had the pain of finding very altered manners,
and of seeing Captain Wentworth.

<p/>Mrs Musgrove and Mrs Hayter were sisters.  They had each had money, but
their marriages had made a material difference in their degree of
consequence.  Mr Hayter had some property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) own, but it was
insignificant compared with Mr Musgrove's; and while the Musgroves were
in the first class of society in the country, the young Hayters would,
from their parents' inferior, retired, and unpolished way of living,
and their own defective education, have been hardly in any class at
all, but for their connexion with Uppercross, this eldest son of course
excepted, who had chosen to be a scholar and a gentleman, and who was
very superior in cultivation and manners to all the rest.

<p/>The two families had always been on excellent terms, there being no
pride on one side, and no envy on the other, and only such a
consciousness of superiority in the Miss Musgroves, as made them
pleased to improve their cousins.  Charles's attentions to Henrietta
had been observed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) father and mother without any disapprobation.
<div class="bookquote">"It would not be a great match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>); but if Henrietta liked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)," (<font color='red'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)</div>--
and Henrietta did seem to like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>Henrietta fully thought so herself, before Captain Wentworth came; but
from that time Cousin Charles had been very much forgotten.

<p/>Which of the two sisters was preferred by Captain Wentworth was as yet
quite doubtful, as far as Anne's observation reached.  Henrietta was
perhaps the prettiest, Louisa had the higher spirits; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) knew not
now, whether the more gentle or the more lively character were most
likely to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).

<p/>Mr and Mrs Musgrove, either from seeing little, or from an entire
confidence in the discretion of both their daughters, and of all the
young men who came near them, seemed to leave everything to take its
chance.  There was not the smallest appearance of solicitude or remark
about them in the Mansion-house; but it was different at the Cottage:
the young couple there were more disposed to speculate and wonder; and
Captain Wentworth had not been above four or five times in the Miss
Musgroves' company, and Charles Hayter had but just reappeared, when
Anne had to listen to the opinions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister, as to
which was the one liked best.  Charles gave it for Louisa, Mary for
Henrietta, but quite agreeing that to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) marry either could be
extremely delightful.

<p/>Charles "had never seen a pleasanter man in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) life; and from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
had once heard Captain Wentworth himself say, was very sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had
not made less than twenty thousand pounds by the war.  Here was a
fortune at once; besides which, there would be the chance of what might
be done in any future war; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was sure Captain Wentworth was as
likely a man to distinguish himself as any officer in the navy.  Oh! it
would be a capital match for either of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) sisters."

<p/>"Upon my word it would,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mary.  " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Dear me!  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should rise to
any very great honours!  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should ever be made a baronet!  'Lady
Wentworth' sounds very well.  That would be a noble thing, indeed, for
Henrietta!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would take place of me then, and Henrietta would not
dislike that.  Sir Frederick and Lady Wentworth!  It would be but a new
creation, however, and I never think much of your new creations."

<p/>It suited Mary best to think Henrietta the one preferred on the very
account of Charles Hayter, whose pretensions she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) wished to see put an
end to.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked down very decidedly upon the Hayters, and thought
it would be quite a misfortune to have the existing connection between
the families renewed--very sad for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) children.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You know,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), "I cannot think him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) at all a fit match for
Henrietta; and considering the alliances which the Musgroves have made,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) has no right to throw herself away.  I do not think any young woman
has a right to make a choice that may be disagreeable and inconvenient
to the principal part of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family, and be giving bad connections to
those who have not been used to them.  And, pray, who is Charles
Hayter?  Nothing but a country curate.  A most improper match for Miss
Musgrove of Uppercross.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) husband, however, would not agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) here; for besides having
a regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) cousin, Charles Hayter was an eldest son, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) saw
things as an eldest son himself.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>Now you are talking nonsense, Mary," was therefore his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) answer.  "It
would not be a great match for Henrietta, but Charles has a very fair
chance, through the Spicers, of getting something from the Bishop in
the course of a year or two; and you will please to remember, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bishop</b></font>)
is the eldest son; whenever my uncle dies, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) steps into very pretty
property.  The estate at Winthrop is not less than two hundred and
fifty acres, besides the farm near Taunton, which is some of the best
land in the country.  I grant you, that any of them but Charles would
be a very shocking match for Henrietta, and indeed it could not be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
is the only one that could be possible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is a very good-natured,
good sort of a fellow; and whenever Winthrop comes into his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) hands, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
will make a different sort of place of it, and live in a very different
sort of way; and with that property, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will never be a contemptible
man--good, freehold property.  No, no; Henrietta might do worse than
marry Charles Hayter; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) has him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>), and Louisa can get Captain
Wentworth, I shall be very well satisfied."

<p/>"Charles may say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) pleases,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mary to Anne, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
was out of the room, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>but it would be shocking to have Henrietta marry
Charles Hayter; a very bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), and still worse for me; and
therefore it is very much to be wished that Captain Wentworth may soon
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) head, and I have very little doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
has.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) took hardly any notice of Charles Hayter yesterday.  I wish
you had been there to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) behaviour.  And as to Captain Wentworth's
liking Louisa as well as Henrietta, it is nonsense to say so; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
certainly does like Henrietta a great deal the best.  But Charles is so
positive!  I wish you had been with us yesterday, for then you might
have decided between us; and I am sure you would have thought as I did,
unless you had been determined to give it against me."

<p/>A dinner at Mr Musgrove's had been the occasion when all these things
should have been seen by Anne; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had staid at home, under the
mixed plea of a headache of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own, and some return of indisposition
in little Charles.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had thought only of avoiding Captain Wentworth;
but an escape from being appealed to as umpire was now added to the
advantages of a quiet evening.

<p/>As to Captain Wentworth's views, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) deemed it of more consequence that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) should know his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own mind early enough not to be endangering the
happiness of either sister, or impeaching his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) own honour, than that he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
should prefer Henrietta to Louisa, or Louisa to Henrietta.  Either of
them would, in all probability, make him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) an affectionate, good-humoured
wife.  With regard to Charles Hayter, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had delicacy which must be
pained by any lightness of conduct in a well-meaning young woman, and a
heart to sympathize in any of the sufferings it occasioned; but if
Henrietta found herself mistaken in the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) feelings, the
alteration could not be understood too soon.

<p/>Charles Hayter had met with much to disquiet and mortify him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
cousin's behaviour.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had too old a regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) to be so wholly
estranged as might in two meetings extinguish every past hope, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) nothing to do but to keep away from Uppercross:  but there
was such a change as became very alarming, when such a man as Captain
Wentworth was to be regarded as the probable cause.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been absent
only two Sundays, and when they parted, had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) interested, even
to the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) wishes, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) prospect of soon quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
present curacy, and obtaining that of Uppercross instead.  It had then
seemed the object nearest her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) heart, that Dr Shirley, the rector, who
for more than forty years had been zealously discharging all the duties
of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) office, but was now growing too infirm for many of them, should
be quite fixed on engaging a curate; should make his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) curacy quite as
good as he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) could afford, and should give Charles Hayter the promise of
it.  The advantage of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) having to come only to Uppercross, instead of
going six miles another way; of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) having, in every respect, a better
curacy; of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) belonging to their dear Dr Shirley, and of dear, good Dr
Shirley's being relieved from the duty which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) could no longer get
through without most injurious fatigue, had been a great deal, even to
Louisa, but had been almost everything to Henrietta.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) came
back, alas!  the zeal of the business was gone by.  Louisa could not
listen at all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) account of a conversation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) had just held
with Dr Shirley: she (<font color='blue'><b>Shirley</b></font>) was at a window, looking out for Captain
Wentworth; and even Henrietta had at best only a divided attention to
give, and seemed to have forgotten all the former doubt and solicitude
of the negotiation.

<p/>"Well, I am very glad indeed:  but I always thought you would have it;
I always thought you sure.  It did not appear to me that--in short, you
know, Dr Shirley must have a curate, and you had secured his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) promise.
Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) coming, Louisa?"

<p/>One morning, very soon after the dinner at the Musgroves, at which Anne
had not been present, Captain Wentworth walked into the drawing-room at
the Cottage, where were only herself and the little invalid Charles,
who was lying on the sofa.

<p/>The surprise of finding himself almost alone with Anne Elliot, deprived
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) manners of their usual composure:  he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) started, and could only say,
<div class="bookquote">"I thought the Miss Musgroves had been here: Mrs Musgrove told me I
should find them here,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) walked to the window to recollect
himself, and feel how he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) ought to behave.

<p/>"They are up stairs with my sister:  they will be down in a few
moments, I dare say," had been Anne's reply, in all the confusion that
was natural; and if the child had not called her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to come and do
something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have been out of the room the next moment,
and released Captain Wentworth as well as herself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) continued at the window; and after calmly and politely saying, <div class="bookquote">"I
hope the little boy is better,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>was silent.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was obliged to kneel down by the sofa, and remain there to satisfy
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) patient; and thus they continued a few minutes, when, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) very
great satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) heard some other person crossing the little
vestibule.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hoped, on turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) head, to see the master of the
house; but it proved to be one much less calculated for making matters
easy--Charles Hayter, probably not at all better pleased by the sight
of Captain Wentworth than Captain Wentworth had been by the sight of
Anne.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only attempted to say, "How do you do?  Will you not sit down?  The
others will be here presently."

<p/>Captain Wentworth, however, came from his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) window, apparently not
ill-disposed for conversation; but Charles Hayter soon put an end to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) attempts by seating himself near the table, and taking up the
newspaper; and Captain Wentworth returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) window.

<p/>Another minute brought another addition.  The younger boy, a remarkable
stout, forward child, of two years old, having got the door opened for
him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) by some one without, made his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) determined appearance among them, and
went straight to the sofa to see what was going on, and put in his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
claim to anything good that might be giving away.

<p/>There being nothing to eat, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) could only have some play; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
aunt would not let him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) tease his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sick brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) began to fasten
himself upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knelt, in such a way that, busy as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was
about Charles, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) could not shake him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) off.  She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), ordered,
entreated, and insisted in vain.  Once she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) did contrive to push him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
away, but the boy had the greater pleasure in getting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) back
again directly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Walter,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), "get down this moment.  You are extremely
troublesome.  I am very angry with you."

<p/>"Walter," cried Charles Hayter, "why do you not do as you are bid?  Do
not you hear your aunt speak?  Come to me, Walter, come to cousin
Charles.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But not a bit did Walter stir.

<p/>In another moment, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found herself in the state of being
released from him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); some one was taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had bent
down her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) head so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) little sturdy hands were unfastened
from around her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) neck, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was resolutely borne away, before she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) knew
that Captain Wentworth had done it.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sensations on the discovery made her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perfectly speechless.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
could not even thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could only hang over little Charles,
with most disordered feelings.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) kindness in stepping forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
relief, the manner, the silence in which it had passed, the little
particulars of the circumstance, with the conviction soon forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
by the noise he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was studiously making with the child, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) meant to
avoid hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thanks, and rather sought to testify that her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
conversation was the last of his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wants, produced such a confusion of
varying, but very painful agitation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not recover from,
till enabled by the entrance of Mary and the Miss Musgroves to make
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little patient to their cares, and leave the room.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could
not stay.  It might have been an opportunity of watching the loves and
jealousies of the four--they were now altogether; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could stay
for none of it.  It was evident that Charles Hayter was not well
inclined towards Captain Wentworth.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a strong impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)
having said, in a vext tone of voice, after Captain Wentworth's
interference, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You ought to have minded me, Walter; I told you not to
teaze your aunt;" and could comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) regretting that Captain
Wentworth should do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) ought to have done himself.  But neither
Charles Hayter's feelings, nor anybody's feelings, could interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had a little better arranged her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was ashamed of
herself, quite ashamed of being so nervous, so overcome by such a
trifle; but so it was, and it required a long application of solitude
and reflection to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).
