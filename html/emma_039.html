<p/>This little explanation with Mr. Knightley gave Emma considerable pleasure. It was one of the agreeable recollections of the ball, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about the lawn the next morning to enjoy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was extremely glad that they had come to so good an understanding respecting the Eltons, and that their opinions of both husband and wife were so much alike; and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) praise of Harriet, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) concession in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) favour, was peculiarly gratifying. The impertinence of the Eltons, which for a few minutes had threatened to ruin the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evening, had been the occasion of some of its highest satisfactions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked forward to another happy result the cure of Harriet's infatuation. From Harriet's manner of speaking of the circumstance before they quitted the ballroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had strong hopes. It seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes were suddenly opened, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were enabled to see that Mr. Elton was not the superior creature she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). The fever was over, and Emma could harbour little fear of the pulse being quickened again by injurious courtesy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) depended on the evil feelings of the Eltons for supplying all the discipline of pointed neglect that could be farther requisite. Harriet rational, Frank Churchill not too much in love, and Mr. Knightley not wanting to quarrel with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), how very happy a summer must be before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not to see Frank Churchill this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not allow himself the pleasure of stopping at Hartfield, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was to be at home by the middle of the day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) did not regret it.

<p/>Having arranged all these matters, looked them through, and put them all to rights, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was just turning to the house with spirits freshened up for the demands of the two little boys, as well as of their grandpapa, when the great iron sweep-gate opened, and two persons entered whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had never less expected to see together Frank Churchill, with Harriet leaning on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) arm actually Harriet! A moment sufficed to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that something extraordinary had happened. Harriet looked white and frightened, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was trying to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). The iron gates and the front-door were not twenty yards asunder; they were all three soon in the hall, and Harriet immediately sinking into a chair fainted away.

<p/>A young lady who faints, must be recovered; questions must be answered, and surprizes be explained. Such events are very interesting, but the suspense of them cannot last long. A few minutes made Emma acquainted with the whole.

<p/>Miss Smith, and Miss Bickerton, another parlour boarder at Mrs. Goddard's, who had been also at the ball, had walked out together, and taken a road, the Richmond road, which, though apparently public enough for safety, had led them into alarm. About half a mile beyond Highbury, making a sudden turn, and deeply shaded by elms on each side, it became for a considerable stretch very retired; and when the young ladies had advanced some way into it, they had suddenly perceived at a small distance before them, on a broader patch of greensward by the side, a party of gipsies. A child on the watch, came towards them to beg; and Miss Bickerton, excessively frightened, gave a great scream, and calling on Harriet to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), ran up a steep bank, cleared a slight hedge at the top, and made the best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way by a short cut back to Highbury. But poor Harriet could not follow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had suffered very much from cramp after dancing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempt to mount the bank brought on such a return of it as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absolutely powerless and in this state, and exceedingly terrified, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been obliged to remain.

<p/>How the trampers might have behaved, had the young ladies been more courageous, must be doubtful; but such an invitation for attack could not be resisted; and Harriet was soon assailed by half a dozen children, headed by a stout woman and a great boy, all clamorous, and impertinent in look, though not absolutely in word. More and more frightened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediately promised them money, and taking out her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse, gave them a shilling, and begged them not to want more, or to use her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was then able to walk, though but slowly, and was moving away but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) terror and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) purse were too tempting, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was followed, or rather surrounded, by the whole gang, demanding more.

<p/>In this state Frank Churchill had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trembling and conditioning, they loud and insolent. By a most fortunate chance his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) leaving Highbury had been delayed so as to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) assistance at this critical moment. The pleasantness of the morning had induced him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to walk forward, and leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) horses to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) by another road, a mile or two beyond Highbury and happening to have borrowed a pair of scissors the night before of Miss Bates, and to have forgotten to restore them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been obliged to stop at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) door, and go in for a few minutes: he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was therefore later than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had intended; and being on foot, was unseen by the whole party till almost close to them. The terror which the woman and boy had been creating in Harriet was then their own portion. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had left them completely frightened; and Harriet eagerly clinging to him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>), and hardly able to speak, had just strength enough to reach Hartfield, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) idea to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) to Hartfield: he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) had thought of no other place.

<p/>This was the amount of the whole story, of his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) communication and of Harriet's as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) senses and speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) dared not stay longer than to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) well; these several delays left him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) not another minute to lose; and Emma engaging to give assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) safety to Mrs. Goddard, and notice of there being such a set of people in the neighbourhood to Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) set off, with all the grateful blessings that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could utter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend and herself.

<p/>Such an adventure as this, a fine young man and a lovely young woman thrown together in such a way, could hardly fail of suggesting certain ideas to the coldest heart and the steadiest brain. So Emma thought, at least. Could a linguist, could a grammarian, could even a mathematician have seen what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, have witnessed their appearance together, and heard their history of it, without feeling that circumstances had been at work to make them peculiarly interesting to each other? How much more must an imaginist, like herself, be on fire with speculation and foresight! especially with such a groundwork of anticipation as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind had already made.

<p/>It was a very extraordinary thing! Nothing of the sort had ever occurred before to any young ladies in the place, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory; no rencontre, no alarm of the kind; and now it had happened to the very person, and at the very hour, when the other very person was chancing to pass by to rescue her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)! It certainly was very extraordinary! And knowing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, the favourable state of mind of each at this period, it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the more. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was wishing to get the better of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) attachment to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) just recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mania for Mr. Elton. It seemed as if every thing united to promise the most interesting consequences. It was not possible that the occurrence should not be strongly recommending each to the other.

<p/>In the few minutes' conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had yet had with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while Harriet had been partially insensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) terror, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) na vet , her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fervour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seized and clung to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) arm, with a sensibility amused and delighted; and just at last, after Harriet's own account had been given, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) indignation at the abominable folly of Miss Bickerton in the warmest terms. Every thing was to take its natural course, however, neither impelled nor assisted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) would not stir a step, nor drop a hint. No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) had had enough of interference. There could be no harm in a scheme, a mere passive scheme. It was no more than a wish. Beyond it she (<font color='blue'><b>Bickerton</b></font>) would on no account proceed.

<p/>Emma's first resolution was to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father from the knowledge of what had passed, aware of the anxiety and alarm it would occasion: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) soon felt that concealment must be impossible. Within half an hour it was known all over Highbury. It was the very event to engage those who talk most, the young and the low; and all the youth and servants in the place were soon in the happiness of frightful news. The last night's ball seemed lost in the gipsies. Poor Mr. Woodhouse trembled as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sat, and, as Emma had foreseen, would scarcely be satisfied without their promising never to go beyond the shrubbery again. It was some comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that many inquiries after himself and Miss Woodhouse (for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) loved to be inquired after), as well as Miss Smith, were coming in during the rest of the day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had the pleasure of returning for answer, that they were all very indifferent which, though not exactly true, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was perfectly well, and Harriet not much otherwise, Emma would not interfere with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an unhappy state of health in general for the child of such a man, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly knew what indisposition was; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not invent illnesses for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could make no figure in a message.

<p/>The gipsies did not wait for the operations of justice; they took themselves off in a hurry. The young ladies of Highbury might have walked again in safety before their panic began, and the whole history dwindled soon into a matter of little importance but to Emma and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nephews: in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination it maintained its ground, and Henry and John were still asking every day for the story of Harriet and the gipsies, and still tenaciously setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) varied in the slightest particular from the original recital.
