<p/>Elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a
letter from Jane on their first arrival at Lambton; and this
disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had
now been spent there; but on the third her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) repining was over, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister justified, by the receipt of two letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at
once, on one of which was marked that it had been missent
elsewhere. Elizabeth was not surprised at it, as Jane had written
the direction remarkably ill.

<p/>They had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle and aunt, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to enjoy them in quiet, set off
by themselves. The one missent must first be attended to; it had
been written five days ago. The beginning contained an account of
all their little parties and engagements, with such news as the
country afforded; but the latter half, which was dated a day
later, and written in evident agitation, gave more important
intelligence. It was to this effect:

<p/>"Since writing the above, dearest Lizzy, something has occurred
of a most unexpected and serious nature; but I am afraid of
alarming you—be assured that we are all well. What I have to say
relates to poor Lydia. An express came at twelve last night, just
as we were all gone to bed, from Colonel Forster, to inform us
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was gone off to Scotland with one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) officers; to
own the truth, with Wickham! Imagine our surprise. To Kitty,
however, it does not seem so wholly unexpected. I am very, very
sorry. So imprudent a match on both sides! But I am willing to
hope the best, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character has been misunderstood.
Thoughtless and indiscreet I can easily believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), but this
step (and let us rejoice over it) marks nothing bad at heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
choice is disinterested at least, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must know my father can
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) nothing. Our poor mother is sadly grieved. My father
bears it better. How thankful am I that we never let them know
what has been said against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); we must forget it ourselves. They
were off Saturday night about twelve, as is conjectured, but were
not missed till yesterday morning at eight. The express was sent
off directly. My dear Lizzy, they must have passed within ten
miles of us. Colonel Forster gives us reason to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) here
soon. Lydia left a few lines for his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) wife, informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) of their
intention. I must conclude, for I cannot be long from my poor
mother. I am afraid you will not be able to make it out, but I
hardly know what I have written.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Without allowing herself time for consideration, and scarcely
knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) felt, Elizabeth on finishing this letter
instantly seized the other, and opening it with the utmost
impatience, read as follows: it had been written a day later than
the conclusion of the first.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>By this time, my dearest sister, you have received my hurried
letter; I wish this may be more intelligible, but though not
confined for time, my head is so bewildered that I cannot answer
for being coherent. Dearest Lizzy, I hardly know what I would
write, but I have bad news for you, and it cannot be delayed.
Imprudent as the marriage between Mr. Wickham and our poor Lydia
would be, we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place,
for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to
Scotland. Colonel Forster came yesterday, having left Brighton
the day before, not many hours after the express. Though Lydia’s
short letter to Mrs. F. gave them to understand that they were
going to Gretna Green, something was dropped by Denny expressing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) belief that W. never intended to go there, or to marry Lydia
at all, which was repeated to Colonel F., who, instantly taking
the alarm, set off from B. intending to trace their route. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did
trace them easily to Clapham, but no further; for on entering
that place, they removed into a hackney coach, and dismissed the
chaise that brought them from Epsom. All that is known after this
is, that they were seen to continue the London road. I know not
what to think. After making every possible enquiry on that side
London, Colonel F. came on into Hertfordshire, anxiously renewing
them at all the turnpikes, and at the inns in Barnet and
Hatfield, but without any success—no such people had been seen to
pass through. With the kindest concern he (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) came on to Longbourn,
and broke his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) heart. I am sincerely grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Hatfield</b></font>) and Mrs. F., but no one
can throw any blame on them. Our distress, my dear Lizzy, is very
great. My father and mother believe the worst, but I cannot think
so ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Many circumstances might make it more eligible for
them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first
plan; and even if _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ could form such a design against a young
woman of Lydia’s connections, which is not likely, can I suppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) so lost to everything? Impossible! I grieve to find, however,
that Colonel F. is not disposed to depend upon their marriage; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) head when I expressed my hopes, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) feared W.
was not a man to be trusted. My poor mother is really ill, and
keeps her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) room. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) exert herself, it would be better; but
this is not to be expected. And as to my father, I never in my
life saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so affected. Poor Kitty has anger for having
concealed their attachment; but as it was a matter of confidence,
one cannot wonder. I am truly glad, dearest Lizzy, that you have
been spared something of these distressing scenes; but now, as
the first shock is over, shall I own that I long for your return?
I am not so selfish, however, as to press for it, if
inconvenient. Adieu! I take up my pen again to do what I have
just told you I would not; but circumstances are such that I
cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as
possible. I know my dear uncle and aunt so well, that I am not
afraid of requesting it, though I have still something more to
ask of the former. My father is going to London with Colonel
Forster instantly, to try to discover her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). What he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) means to do I
am sure I know not; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) excessive distress will not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
to pursue any measure in the best and safest way, and Colonel
Forster is obliged to be at Brighton again to-morrow evening. In
such an exigence, my uncle’s advice and assistance would be
everything in the world; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will immediately comprehend what I
must feel, and I rely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) goodness."

<p/>"Oh! where, where is my uncle?" cried Elizabeth, darting from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
seat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) finished the letter, in eagerness to follow him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>),
without losing a moment of the time so precious; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
reached the door it was opened by a servant, and Mr. Darcy
appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pale face and impetuous manner made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) start, and
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could recover himself to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), in whose mind
every idea was superseded by Lydia’s situation, hastily
exclaimed, "I beg your pardon, but I must leave you. I must find
Mr. Gardiner this moment, on business that cannot be delayed; I
have not an instant to lose."

<p/>"Good God! what is the matter?" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), with more feeling than
politeness; then recollecting himself, "I will not detain you a
minute; but let me, or let the servant go after Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner. You are not well enough; you cannot go yourself.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth hesitated, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knees trembled under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
felt how little would be gained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attempting to pursue them.
Calling back the servant, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) commissioned him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>), though
in so breathless an accent as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) almost unintelligible, to
fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) master and mistress home instantly.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) quitting the room she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down, unable to support herself,
and looking so miserably ill, that it was impossible for Darcy to
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), or to refrain from saying, in a tone of gentleness and
commiseration, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Let me call your maid. Is there nothing you could
take to give you present relief? A glass of wine; shall I get you
one? You are very ill."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, I thank you,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) replied, endeavouring to recover herself.
"There is nothing the matter with me. I am quite well; I am only
distressed by some dreadful news which I have just received from
Longbourn."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) burst into tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) alluded to it, and for a few minutes
could not speak another word. Darcy, in wretched suspense, could
only say something indistinctly of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) concern, and observe her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>)
in compassionate silence. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) spoke again. "I have just
had a letter from Jane, with such dreadful news. It cannot be
concealed from anyone. My younger sister has left all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
friends—has eloped; has thrown herself into the power of—of Mr.
Wickham. They are gone off together from Brighton. _You_ know him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
too well to doubt the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has no money, no connections,
nothing that can tempt him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to—she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is lost for ever.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Darcy was fixed in astonishment. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>When I consider," she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) added in
a yet more agitated voice, "that _I_ might have prevented it! _I_
who knew what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was. Had I but explained some part of it
only—some part of what I learnt, to my own family! Had his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
character been known, this could not have happened. But it is
all—all too late now."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am grieved indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>cried Darcy; "grieved—shocked. But is it
certain—absolutely certain?"

<p/>"Oh, yes! They left Brighton together on Sunday night, and were
traced almost to London, but not beyond; they are certainly not
gone to Scotland."

<p/>"And what has been done, what has been attempted, to recover
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?"

<p/>"My father is gone to London, and Jane has written to beg my
uncle’s immediate assistance; and we shall be off, I hope, in
half-an-hour. But nothing can be done—I know very well that
nothing can be done. How is such a man to be worked on? How are
they even to be discovered? I have not the smallest hope. It is
every way horrible!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Darcy shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) head in silent acquiescence.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>When _my_ eyes were opened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) real character—Oh! had I known
what I ought, what I dared to do! But I knew not—I was afraid of
doing too much. Wretched, wretched mistake!"

<p/>Darcy made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed scarcely to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), and was
walking up and down the room in earnest meditation, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brow
contracted, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) air gloomy. Elizabeth soon observed, and
instantly understood it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power was sinking; everything _must_
sink under such a proof of family weakness, such an assurance of
the deepest disgrace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could neither wonder nor condemn, but
the belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) self-conquest brought nothing consolatory to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bosom, afforded no palliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) distress. It was, on the
contrary, exactly calculated to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
wishes; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so honestly felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), as now, when all love must be vain.

<p/>But self, though it would intrude, could not engross her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).
Lydia—the humiliation, the misery she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was bringing on them all,
soon swallowed up every private care; and covering her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) face with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) handkerchief, Elizabeth was soon lost to everything else;
and, after a pause of several minutes, was only recalled to a
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation by the voice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companion, who, in a
manner which, though it spoke compassion, spoke likewise
restraint, said, "I am afraid you have been long desiring my
absence, nor have I anything to plead in excuse of my stay, but
real, though unavailing concern. Would to Heaven that anything
could be either said or done on my part that might offer
consolation to such distress! But I will not torment you with
vain wishes, which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks.
This unfortunate affair will, I fear, prevent my sister’s having
the pleasure of seeing you at Pemberley to-day."

<p/>"Oh, yes. Be so kind as to apologise for us to Miss Darcy. Say
that urgent business calls us home immediately. Conceal the
unhappy truth as long as it is possible, I know it cannot be
long."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) readily assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) secrecy; again expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sorrow
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) distress, wished it a happier conclusion than there was
at present reason to hope, and leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) compliments for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
relations, with only one serious, parting look, went away.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) quitted the room, Elizabeth felt how improbable it was that
they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality
as had marked their several meetings in Derbyshire; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their
acquaintance, so full of contradictions and varieties, sighed at
the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted
its continuance, and would formerly have rejoiced in its
termination.

<p/>If gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection,
Elizabeth’s change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor
faulty. But if otherwise—if regard springing from such sources is
unreasonable or unnatural, in comparison of what is so often
described as arising on a first interview with its object, and
even before two words have been exchanged, nothing can be said in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) defence, except that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had given somewhat of a trial to the
latter method in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partiality for Wickham, and that its ill
success might, perhaps, authorise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to seek the other less
interesting mode of attachment. Be that as it may, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) go
with regret; and in this early example of what Lydia’s infamy
must produce, found additional anguish as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) reflected on that
wretched business. Never, since reading Jane’s second letter, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) entertained a hope of Wickham’s meaning to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). No one
but Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought, could flatter herself with such an
expectation. Surprise was the least of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings on this
development. While the contents of the first letter remained in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was all surprise—all astonishment that Wickham
should marry a girl whom it was impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could marry for
money; and how Lydia could ever have attached him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had appeared
incomprehensible. But now it was all too natural. For such an
attachment as this she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) might have sufficient charms; and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) did not suppose Lydia to be deliberately engaging in an
elopement without the intention of marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had no
difficulty in believing that neither her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) virtue nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
understanding would preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) from falling an easy prey.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had never perceived, while the regiment was in Hertfordshire,
that Lydia had any partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was convinced that
Lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody.
Sometimes one officer, sometimes another, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) favourite,
as their attentions raised them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) affections
had continually been fluctuating but never without an object. The
mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a
girl—oh! how acutely did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) now feel it!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was wild to be at home—to hear, to see, to be upon the spot
to share with Jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), in a family so deranged, a father absent, a mother incapable
of exertion, and requiring constant attendance; and though almost
persuaded that nothing could be done for Lydia, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle’s
interference seemed of the utmost importance, and till he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) entered
the room her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) impatience was severe. Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner had
hurried back in alarm, supposing by the servant’s account that
their niece was taken suddenly ill; but satisfying them instantly
on that head, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eagerly communicated the cause of their
summons, reading the two letters aloud, and dwelling on the
postscript of the last with trembling energy.— Though Lydia had
never been a favourite with them, Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner could not
but be deeply afflicted. Not Lydia only, but all were concerned
in it; and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror,
Mr. Gardiner promised every assistance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) power. Elizabeth,
though expecting no less, thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) with tears of gratitude;
and all three being actuated by one spirit, everything relating
to their journey was speedily settled. They were to be off as
soon as possible. <div class="bookquote">"But what is to be done about Pemberley?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>cried
Mrs. Gardiner. <div class="bookquote">"John told us Mr. Darcy was here when you sent for
us; was it so?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Yes; and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) we should not be able to keep our
engagement. _That_ is all settled."

<p/>"That is all settled;<div class="bookquote">" repeated the other, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) ran into her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
room to prepare. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And are they upon such terms as for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to
disclose the real truth? Oh, that I knew how it was!"

<p/>But wishes were vain, or at least could only serve to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
in the hurry and confusion of the following hour. Had Elizabeth
been at leisure to be idle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have remained certain that
all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) share of business as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, and amongst
the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at
Lambton, with false excuses for their sudden departure. An hour,
however, saw the whole completed; and Mr. Gardiner meanwhile
having settled his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) account at the inn, nothing remained to be
done but to go; and Elizabeth, after all the misery of the
morning, found herself, in a shorter space of time than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
have supposed, seated in the carriage, and on the road to
Longbourn.
