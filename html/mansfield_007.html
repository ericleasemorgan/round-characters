<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Fanny, and how do you like Miss Crawford _now_?"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund the
next day, after thinking some time on the subject himself. <div class="bookquote">"How did you
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) yesterday?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Very well—very much. I like to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entertains me; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is so extremely pretty, that I have great pleasure in looking at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)."

<p/>"It is her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) countenance that is so attractive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has a wonderful play
of feature! But was there nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) conversation that struck you,
Fanny, as not quite right?"

<p/>"Oh yes! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought not to have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did. I was
quite astonished. An uncle with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has been living so many years,
and who, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) faults may be, is so very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother,
treating him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), they say, quite like a son. I could not have believed
it!"

<p/>"I thought you would be struck. It was very wrong; very indecorous."

<p/>"And very ungrateful, I think."

<p/>"Ungrateful is a strong word. I do not know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle has any
claim to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _gratitude_; his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wife certainly had; and it is the warmth
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s memory which misleads her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) here. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
awkwardly circumstanced. With such warm feelings and lively spirits it
must be difficult to do justice to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affection for Mrs. Crawford,
without throwing a shade on the Admiral. I do not pretend to know which
was most to blame in their disagreements, though the Admiral’s present
conduct might incline one to the side of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife; but it is natural
and amiable that Miss Crawford should acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) aunt entirely. I do
not censure her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _opinions_; but there certainly _is_ impropriety in
making them public."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not you think,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a little consideration, "that
this impropriety is a reflection itself upon Mrs. Crawford, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
niece has been entirely brought up by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cannot have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
right notions of what was due to the Admiral."

<p/>"That is a fair remark. Yes, we must suppose the faults of the niece to
have been those of the aunt; and it makes one more sensible of the
disadvantages she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has been under. But I think her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) present home must do
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) good. Mrs. Grant’s manners are just what they ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) brother with a very pleasing affection."

<p/>"Yes, except as to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) writing her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) such short letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) made me
almost laugh; but I cannot rate so very highly the love or good-nature
of a brother who will not give himself the trouble of writing anything
worth reading to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters, when they are separated. I am sure
William would never have used _me_ so, under any circumstances. And
what right had she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to suppose that _you_ would not write long letters
when you were absent?"

<p/>"The right of a lively mind, Fanny, seizing whatever may contribute to
its own amusement or that of others; perfectly allowable, when
untinctured by ill-humour or roughness; and there is not a shadow of
either in the countenance or manner of Miss Crawford: nothing sharp, or
loud, or coarse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is perfectly feminine, except in the instances we
have been speaking of. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cannot be justified. I am glad you saw
it all as I did."

<p/>Having formed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind and gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had a good chance
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thinking like him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); though at this period, and on this subject,
there began now to be some danger of dissimilarity, for he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was in a
line of admiration of Miss Crawford, which might lead him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) where Fanny
could not follow. Miss Crawford’s attractions did not lessen. The harp
arrived, and rather added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) beauty, wit, and good-humour; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
played with the greatest obligingness, with an expression and taste
which were peculiarly becoming, and there was something clever to be
said at the close of every air. Edmund was at the Parsonage every day,
to be indulged with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) favourite instrument: one morning secured an
invitation for the next; for the lady could not be unwilling to have a
listener, and every thing was soon in a fair train.

<p/>A young woman, pretty, lively, with a harp as elegant as herself, and
both placed near a window, cut down to the ground, and opening on a
little lawn, surrounded by shrubs in the rich foliage of summer, was
enough to catch any man’s heart. The season, the scene, the air, were
all favourable to tenderness and sentiment. Mrs. Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) tambour
frame were not without their use: it was all in harmony; and as
everything will turn to account when love is once set going, even the
sandwich tray, and Dr. Grant doing the honours of it, were worth
looking at. Without studying the business, however, or knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
was about, Edmund was beginning, at the end of a week of such
intercourse, to be a good deal in love; and to the credit of the lady
it may be added that, without his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being a man of the world or an elder
brother, without any of the arts of flattery or the gaieties of small
talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) began to be agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt it to be so, though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
had not foreseen, and could hardly understand it; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not
pleasant by any common rule: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) talked no nonsense; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) paid no
compliments; his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinions were unbending, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions tranquil and
simple. There was a charm, perhaps, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sincerity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) steadiness,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) integrity, which Miss Crawford might be equal to feel, though not
equal to discuss with herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not think very much about it,
however: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for the present; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) liked to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) near
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); it was enough.

<p/>Fanny could not wonder that Edmund was at the Parsonage every morning;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would gladly have been there too, might she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) have gone in uninvited
and unnoticed, to hear the harp; neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wonder that, when
the evening stroll was over, and the two families parted again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
should think it right to attend Mrs. Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister to their
home, while Mr. Crawford was devoted to the ladies of the Park; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
thought it a very bad exchange; and if Edmund were not there to mix the
wine and water for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), would rather go without it than not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was a
little surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could spend so many hours with Miss Crawford,
and not see more of the sort of fault which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had already observed,
and of which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ was almost always reminded by a something of the
same nature whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) company; but so it was. Edmund was
fond of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) of Miss Crawford, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed to think it
enough that the Admiral had since been spared; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) scrupled to
point out her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own remarks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), lest it should appear like
ill-nature. The first actual pain which Miss Crawford occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
was the consequence of an inclination to learn to ride, which the
former caught, soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being settled at Mansfield, from the
example of the young ladies at the Park, and which, when Edmund’s
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) increased, led to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) encouraging the wish, and
the offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own quiet mare for the purpose of her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) first attempts,
as the best fitted for a beginner that either stable could furnish. No
pain, no injury, however, was designed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cousin in this
offer: _she (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>)_ was not to lose a day’s exercise by it. The mare was only
to be taken down to the Parsonage half an hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) ride were to
begin; and Fanny, on its being first proposed, so far from feeling
slighted, was almost over-powered with gratitude that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should be
asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leave for it.

<p/>Miss Crawford made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) first essay with great credit to herself, and no
inconvenience to Fanny. Edmund, who had taken down the mare and
presided at the whole, returned with it in excellent time, before
either Fanny or the steady old coachman, who always attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rode without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins, were ready to set forward. The second
day’s trial was not so guiltless. Miss Crawford’s enjoyment of riding
was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not know how to leave off. Active and fearless,
and though rather small, strongly made, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seemed formed for a
horsewoman; and to the pure genuine pleasure of the exercise, something
was probably added in Edmund’s attendance and instructions, and
something more in the conviction of very much surpassing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sex in
general by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) early progress, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) unwilling to dismount. Fanny
was ready and waiting, and Mrs. Norris was beginning to scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) for
not being gone, and still no horse was announced, no Edmund appeared.
To avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt, and look for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) went out.

<p/>The houses, though scarcely half a mile apart, were not within sight of
each other; but, by walking fifty yards from the hall door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
look down the park, and command a view of the Parsonage and all its
demesnes, gently rising beyond the village road; and in Dr. Grant’s
meadow she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) immediately saw the group—Edmund and Miss Crawford both on
horse-back, riding side by side, Dr. and Mrs. Grant, and Mr. Crawford,
with two or three grooms, standing about and looking on. A happy party
it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), all interested in one object: cheerful beyond a
doubt, for the sound of merriment ascended even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). It was a sound
which did not make _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ cheerful; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) wondered that Edmund should
forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), and felt a pang. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) eyes from the
meadow; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not help watching all that passed. At first Miss
Crawford and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) companion made the circuit of the field, which was not
small, at a foot’s pace; then, at _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ apparent suggestion, they rose
into a canter; and to Fanny’s timid nature it was most astonishing to
see how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat. After a few minutes they stopped entirely. Edmund
was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was evidently directing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) management of the bridle; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw it, or
the imagination supplied what the eye could not reach. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must not
wonder at all this; what could be more natural than that Edmund should
be making himself useful, and proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good-nature by any one? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could not but think, indeed, that Mr. Crawford might as well have saved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the trouble; that it would have been particularly proper and
becoming in a brother to have done it himself; but Mr. Crawford, with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) boasted good-nature, and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) coachmanship, probably knew
nothing of the matter, and had no active kindness in comparison of
Edmund. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to think it rather hard upon the mare to have such
double duty; if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) were forgotten, the poor mare should be remembered.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) feelings for one and the other were soon a little tranquillised by
seeing the party in the meadow disperse, and Miss Crawford still on
horseback, but attended by Edmund on foot, pass through a gate into the
lane, and so into the park, and make towards the spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) stood.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began then to be afraid of appearing rude and impatient; and walked
to meet them with a great anxiety to avoid the suspicion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Miss Price,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was at all
within hearing, "I am come to make my own apologies for keeping you
waiting; but I have nothing in the world to say for myself—I knew it
was very late, and that I was behaving extremely ill; and therefore, if
you please, you must forgive me. Selfishness must always be forgiven,
you know, because there is no hope of a cure.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny’s answer was extremely civil, and Edmund added his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) conviction
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could be in no hurry. " (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>For there is more than time enough for
my cousin to ride twice as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever goes," said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), "and you
have been promoting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comfort by preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from setting off half
an hour sooner: clouds are now coming up, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not suffer from
the heat as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have done then. I wish _you_ may not be fatigued
by so much exercise. I wish you had saved yourself this walk home."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No part of it fatigues me but getting off this horse, I assure you,"
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sprang down with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) help; "I am very strong. Nothing
ever fatigues me but doing what I do not like. Miss Price, I give way
to you with a very bad grace; but I sincerely hope you will have a
pleasant ride, and that I may have nothing but good to hear of this
dear, delightful, beautiful animal.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The old coachman, who had been waiting about with his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own horse, now
joining them, Fanny was lifted on hers, and they set off across another
part of the park; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings of discomfort not lightened by seeing,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked back, that the others were walking down the hill together
to the village; nor did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attendant do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) much good by his (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) comments
on Miss Crawford’s great cleverness as a horse-woman, which he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had been
watching with an interest almost equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a lady</b></font>)</div>It is a pleasure to see a lady with such a good heart for riding!"
said he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>). "I never see one sit a horse better. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not seem to have
a thought of fear. Very different from you, miss, when you first began,
six years ago come next Easter. Lord bless you! how you did tremble
when Sir Thomas first had you put on!"

<p/>In the drawing-room Miss Crawford was also celebrated. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merit in
being gifted by Nature with strength and courage was fully appreciated
by the Miss Bertrams; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) delight in riding was like their own; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
early excellence in it was like their own, and they had great pleasure
in praising it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would ride well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>said Julia; "she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) has the make for it.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) figure is as neat as her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) brother’s."

<p/>"Yes,<div class="bookquote">" added Maria, " (<font color='red'><b>spirits</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) spirits are as good, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) has the same
energy of character. I cannot but think that good horsemanship has a
great deal to do with the mind.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>When they parted at night Edmund asked Fanny whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) meant to ride
the next day.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, I do not know—not if you want the mare," was her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) answer.

<p/>"I do not want her (<font color='blue'><b>mare</b></font>) at all for myself," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); "but whenever you are
next inclined to stay at home, I think Miss Crawford would be glad to
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a longer time—for a whole morning, in short. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has a great
desire to get as far as Mansfield Common: Mrs. Grant has been telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) of its fine views, and I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) being perfectly equal
to it. But any morning will do for this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would be extremely sorry
to interfere with you. It would be very wrong if she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ rides
only for pleasure; _you_ for health."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall not ride to-morrow, certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; "I have been out
very often lately, and would rather stay at home. You know I am strong
enough now to walk very well."

<p/>Edmund looked pleased, which must be Fanny’s comfort, and the ride to
Mansfield Common took place the next morning: the party included all
the young people but herself, and was much enjoyed at the time, and
doubly enjoyed again in the evening discussion. A successful scheme of
this sort generally brings on another; and the having been to Mansfield
Common disposed them all for going somewhere else the day after. There
were many other views to be shewn; and though the weather was hot,
there were shady lanes wherever they wanted to go. A young party is
always provided with a shady lane. Four fine mornings successively were
spent in this manner, in shewing the Crawfords the country, and doing
the honours of its finest spots. Everything answered; it was all gaiety
and good-humour, the heat only supplying inconvenience enough to be
talked of with pleasure—till the fourth day, when the happiness of one
of the party was exceedingly clouded. Miss Bertram was the one. Edmund
and Julia were invited to dine at the Parsonage, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ was
excluded. It was meant and done by Mrs. Grant, with perfect
good-humour, on Mr. Rushworth’s account, who was partly expected at the
Park that day; but it was felt as a very grievous injury, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) good
manners were severely taxed to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) vexation and anger till she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
reached home. As Mr. Rushworth did _not_ come, the injury was
increased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had not even the relief of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) power over
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could only be sullen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) mother, aunt, and cousin, and
throw as great a gloom as possible over their dinner and dessert.

<p/>Between ten and eleven Edmund and Julia walked into the drawing-room,
fresh with the evening air, glowing and cheerful, the very reverse of
what they found in the three ladies sitting there, for Maria would
scarcely raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) book, and Lady Bertram was
half-asleep; and even Mrs. Norris, discomposed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) niece’s
ill-humour, and having asked one or two questions about the dinner,
which were not immediately attended to, seemed almost determined to say
no more. For a few minutes the brother and sister were too eager in
their praise of the night and their remarks on the stars, to think
beyond themselves; but when the first pause came, Edmund, looking
around, said, "But where is Fanny? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gone to bed?"

<p/>"No, not that I know of,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs. Norris; " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was here a moment
ago."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own gentle voice speaking from the other end of the room, which was
a very long one, told them that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was on the sofa. Mrs. Norris began
scolding.

<p/>"That is a very foolish trick, Fanny, to be idling away all the evening
upon a sofa. Why cannot you come and sit here, and employ yourself as
_we_ do? If you have no work of your own, I can supply you from the
poor basket. There is all the new calico, that was bought last week,
not touched yet. I am sure I almost broke my back by cutting it out.
You should learn to think of other people; and, take my word for it, it
is a shocking trick for a young person to be always lolling upon a
sofa."

<p/>Before half this was said, Fanny was returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat at the table,
and had taken up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work again; and Julia, who was in high
good-humour, from the pleasures of the day, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) the justice of
exclaiming, "I must say, ma’am, that Fanny is as little upon the sofa
as anybody in the house."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attentively, "I am sure you
have the headache.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not deny it, but said it was not very bad.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I can hardly believe you," he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) replied; "I know your looks too well.
How long have you had it?"

<p/>"Since a little before dinner. It is nothing but the heat."

<p/>"Did you go out in the heat?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Go out! to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris: "would you have her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
stay within such a fine day as this? Were not we _all_ out? Even your
mother was out to-day for above an hour."

<p/>"Yes, indeed, Edmund," added her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ladyship, who had been thoroughly
awakened by Mrs. Norris’s sharp reprimand to Fanny; "I was out above an
hour. I sat three-quarters of an hour in the flower-garden, while Fanny
cut the roses; and very pleasant it was, I assure you, but very hot. It
was shady enough in the alcove, but I declare I quite dreaded the
coming home again."

<p/>"Fanny has been cutting roses, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Yes, and I am afraid they will be the last this year. Poor thing!
_She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ found it hot enough; but they were so full-blown that one could
not wait."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There was no help for it, certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mrs. Norris, in a
rather softened voice; "but I question whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) headache might not
be caught _then_, sister. There is nothing so likely to give it as
standing and stooping in a hot sun; but I dare say it will be well
to-morrow. Suppose you let her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) have your aromatic vinegar; I always
forget to have mine filled."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has got it,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram; "she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) has had it ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
came back from your house the second time."

<p/>"What!" cried Edmund; "has she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) been walking as well as cutting roses;
walking across the hot park to your house, and doing it twice, ma’am?
No wonder her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) head aches.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Norris was talking to Julia, and did not hear.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was afraid it would be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)," said Lady Bertram; "but
when the roses were gathered, your aunt wished to have them, and then
you know they must be taken home."

<p/>"But were there roses enough to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to go twice?"

<p/>"No; but they were to be put into the spare room to dry; and,
unluckily, Fanny forgot to lock the door of the room and bring away the
key, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was obliged to go again."

<p/>Edmund got up and walked about the room, saying, "And could nobody be
employed on such an errand but Fanny? Upon my word, ma’am, it has been
a very ill-managed business."

<p/>"I am sure I do not know how it was to have been done better," cried
Mrs. Norris, unable to be longer deaf; "unless I had gone myself,
indeed; but I cannot be in two places at once; and I was talking to Mr.
Green at that very time about your mother’s dairymaid, by _her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_ desire,
and had promised John Groom to write to Mrs. Jefferies about his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) son,
and the poor fellow was waiting for me half an hour. I think nobody can
justly accuse me of sparing myself upon any occasion, but really I
cannot do everything at once. And as for Fanny’s just stepping down to
my house for me—it is not much above a quarter of a mile—I cannot think
I was unreasonable to ask it. How often do I pace it three times a day,
early and late, ay, and in all weathers too, and say nothing about it?"

<p/>"I wish Fanny had half your strength, ma’am."

<p/>"If Fanny would be more regular in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exercise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not be
knocked up so soon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has not been out on horseback now this long
while, and I am persuaded that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not ride, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to
walk. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been riding before, I should not have asked it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
But I thought it would rather do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good after being stooping among
the roses; for there is nothing so refreshing as a walk after a fatigue
of that kind; and though the sun was strong, it was not so very hot.
Between ourselves, Edmund,<div class="bookquote">" nodding significantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother, " (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>it
was cutting the roses, and dawdling about in the flower-garden, that
did the mischief."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid it was, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said the more candid Lady Bertram, who
had overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); "I am very much afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) caught the headache
there, for the heat was enough to kill anybody. It was as much as I
could bear myself. Sitting and calling to Pug, and trying to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Pug</b></font>)
from the flower-beds, was almost too much for me."

<p/>Edmund said no more to either lady; but going quietly to another table,
on which the supper-tray yet remained, brought a glass of Madeira to
Fanny, and obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to drink the greater part. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished to be able
to decline it; but the tears, which a variety of feelings created, made
it easier to swallow than to speak.

<p/>Vexed as Edmund was with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother and aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was still more angry
with himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own forgetfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was worse than anything
which they had done. Nothing of this would have happened had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been
properly considered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had been left four days together without
any choice of companions or exercise, and without any excuse for
avoiding whatever her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) unreasonable aunts might require. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was ashamed
to think that for four days together she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had not had the power of
riding, and very seriously resolved, however unwilling he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be to
check a pleasure of Miss Crawford’s, that it should never happen again.

<p/>Fanny went to bed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart as full as on the first evening of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
arrival at the Park. The state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits had probably had its
share in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) indisposition; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been feeling neglected, and
been struggling against discontent and envy for some days past. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
leant on the sofa, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had retreated that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not be
seen, the pain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind had been much beyond that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head; and
the sudden change which Edmund’s kindness had then occasioned, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
hardly know how to support herself.
