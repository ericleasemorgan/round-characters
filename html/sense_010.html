<p/>Marianne’s preserver, as Margaret, with more elegance than precision,
styled Willoughby, called at the cottage early the next morning to make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) personal enquiries. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was received by Mrs. Dashwood with more than
politeness; with a kindness which Sir John’s account of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own
gratitude prompted; and every thing that passed during the visit tended
to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) of the sense, elegance, mutual affection, and domestic
comfort of the family to whom accident had now introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). Of their
personal charms he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not required a second interview to be convinced.

<p/>Miss Dashwood had a delicate complexion, regular features, and a
remarkably pretty figure. Marianne was still handsomer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) form,
though not so correct as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s, in having the advantage of
height, was more striking; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face was so lovely, that when in the
common cant of praise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was called a beautiful girl, truth was less
violently outraged than usually happens. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) skin was very brown, but,
from its transparency, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) complexion was uncommonly brilliant; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
features were all good; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) smile was sweet and attractive; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
eyes, which were very dark, there was a life, a spirit, an eagerness,
which could hardly be seen without delight. From Willoughby their
expression was at first held back, by the embarrassment which the
remembrance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) assistance created. But when this passed away, when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits became collected, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw that to the perfect
good-breeding of the gentleman, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) united frankness and vivacity, and
above all, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) declare, that of music and dancing he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
passionately fond, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) such a look of approbation as secured
the largest share of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) discourse to herself for the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stay.

<p/>It was only necessary to mention any favourite amusement to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to talk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not be silent when such points were introduced, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had neither shyness nor reserve in their discussion. They speedily
discovered that their enjoyment of dancing and music was mutual, and
that it arose from a general conformity of judgment in all that related
to either. Encouraged by this to a further examination of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) opinions,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) proceeded to question him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on the subject of books; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) favourite
authors were brought forward and dwelt upon with so rapturous a
delight, that any young man of five and twenty must have been
insensible indeed, not to become an immediate convert to the excellence
of such works, however disregarded before. Their taste was strikingly
alike. The same books, the same passages were idolized by each—or if
any difference appeared, any objection arose, it lasted no longer than
till the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) arguments and the brightness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes could be
displayed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) acquiesced in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) decisions, caught all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
enthusiasm; and long before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) visit concluded, they conversed with
the familiarity of a long-established acquaintance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Marianne,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left them, "for _one_
morning I think you have done pretty well. You have already ascertained
Mr. Willoughby’s opinion in almost every matter of importance. You know
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) thinks of Cowper and Scott; you are certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estimating
their beauties as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) ought, and you have received every assurance of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) admiring Pope no more than is proper. But how is your acquaintance
to be long supported, under such extraordinary despatch of every
subject for discourse? You will soon have exhausted each favourite
topic. Another meeting will suffice to explain his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sentiments on
picturesque beauty, and second marriages, and then you can have nothing
farther to ask."

<p/>"Elinor,<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, " (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>is this fair? is this just? are my ideas so
scanty? But I see what you mean. I have been too much at my ease, too
happy, too frank. I have erred against every common-place notion of
decorum; I have been open and sincere where I ought to have been
reserved, spiritless, dull, and deceitful—had I talked only of the
weather and the roads, and had I spoken only once in ten minutes, this
reproach would have been spared."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My love,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) mother, "you must not be offended with Elinor—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was only in jest. I should scold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) myself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were capable of
wishing to check the delight of your conversation with our new friend."
Marianne was softened in a moment.

<p/>Willoughby, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side, gave every proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pleasure in their
acquaintance, which an evident wish of improving it could offer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
came to them every day. To enquire after Marianne was at first his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
excuse; but the encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) reception, to which every day gave
greater kindness, made such an excuse unnecessary before it had ceased
to be possible, by Marianne’s perfect recovery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was confined for
some days to the house; but never had any confinement been less
irksome. Willoughby was a young man of good abilities, quick
imagination, lively spirits, and open, affectionate manners. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
exactly formed to engage Marianne’s heart, for with all this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) joined
not only a captivating person, but a natural ardour of mind which was
now roused and increased by the example of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, and which
recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) affection beyond every thing else.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) society became gradually her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) most exquisite enjoyment. They read,
they talked, they sang together; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) musical talents were considerable;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) read with all the sensibility and spirit which Edward had
unfortunately wanted.

<p/>In Mrs. Dashwood’s estimation he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was as faultless as in Marianne’s; and
Elinor saw nothing to censure in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) but a propensity, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
strongly resembled and peculiarly delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, of saying too
much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thought on every occasion, without attention to persons or
circumstances. In hastily forming and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion of other
people, in sacrificing general politeness to the enjoyment of undivided
attention where his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart was engaged, and in slighting too easily the
forms of worldly propriety, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) displayed a want of caution which Elinor
could not approve, in spite of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and Marianne could say in
its support.

<p/>Marianne began now to perceive that the desperation which had seized
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at sixteen and a half, of ever seeing a man who could satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
ideas of perfection, had been rash and unjustifiable. Willoughby was
all that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancy had delineated in that unhappy hour and in every
brighter period, as capable of attaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour
declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wishes to be in that respect as earnest, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) abilities
were strong.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother too, in whose mind not one speculative thought of their
marriage had been raised, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) prospect of riches, was led before the
end of a week to hope and expect it; and secretly to congratulate
herself on having gained two such sons-in-law as Edward and Willoughby.

<p/>Colonel Brandon’s partiality for Marianne, which had so early been
discovered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) friends, now first became perceptible to Elinor, when
it ceased to be noticed by them. Their attention and wit were drawn off
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) more fortunate rival; and the raillery which the other had
incurred before any partiality arose, was removed when his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) feelings
began really to call for the ridicule so justly annexed to sensibility.
Elinor was obliged, though unwillingly, to believe that the sentiments
which Mrs. Jennings had assigned him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own satisfaction, were now
actually excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister; and that however a general resemblance
of disposition between the parties might forward the affection of Mr.
Willoughby, an equally striking opposition of character was no
hindrance to the regard of Colonel Brandon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw it with concern;
for what could a silent man of five and thirty hope, when opposed to a
very lively one of five and twenty? and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not even wish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
successful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heartily wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indifferent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)—in spite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gravity and reserve, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) beheld in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) an object of interest.
His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners, though serious, were mild; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserve appeared rather
the result of some oppression of spirits than of any natural gloominess
of temper. Sir John had dropped hints of past injuries and
disappointments, which justified her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) being an unfortunate
man, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) regarded him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) with respect and compassion.

<p/>Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) pitied and esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) the more because he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was slighted by
Willoughby and Marianne, who, prejudiced against him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for being neither
lively nor young, seemed resolved to undervalue his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) merits.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Brandon is just the kind of man,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby one day, when they
were talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) together, "whom every body speaks well of, and
nobody cares about; whom all are delighted to see, and nobody remembers
to talk to."

<p/>"That is exactly what I think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)," cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not boast of it, however,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "for it is injustice in
both of you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is highly esteemed by all the family at the park, and I
never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) myself without taking pains to converse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)."

<p/>"That he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is patronised by _you_,<div class="bookquote">" replied Willoughby, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>is certainly in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) favour; but as for the esteem of the others, it is a reproach in
itself. Who would submit to the indignity of being approved by such a
woman as Lady Middleton and Mrs. Jennings, that could command the
indifference of any body else?"

<p/>"But perhaps the abuse of such people as yourself and Marianne will
make amends for the regard of Lady Middleton and her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother. If their
praise is censure, your censure may be praise, for they are not more
undiscerning, than you are prejudiced and unjust."

<p/>"In defence of your _protégé_ you can even be saucy."

<p/>"My _protégé_, as you call him (<font color='blue'><b>protégé</b></font>), is a sensible man; and sense will
always have attractions for me. Yes, Marianne, even in a man between
thirty and forty. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has seen a great deal of the world; has been
abroad, has read, and has a thinking mind. I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) capable of
giving me much information on various subjects; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has always
answered my inquiries with readiness of good-breeding and good nature."

<p/>"That is to say,<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne contemptuously, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has told you, that
in the East Indies the climate is hot, and the mosquitoes are
troublesome."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _would_ have told me so, I doubt not, had I made any such
inquiries, but they happened to be points on which I had been
previously informed."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, "his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) observations may have extended to the
existence of nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins."

<p/>"I may venture to say that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)_ observations have stretched much
further than _your_ candour. But why should you dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?"

<p/>"I do not dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), on the contrary, as a very
respectable man, who has every body’s good word, and nobody’s notice;
who has more money than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can spend, more time than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows how to
employ, and two new coats every year."

<p/>"Add to which,<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has neither genius, taste, nor
spirit. That his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understanding has no brilliancy, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings no
ardour, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) voice no expression."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You decide on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) imperfections so much in the mass,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor,
"and so much on the strength of your own imagination, that the
commendation _I_ am able to give of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is comparatively cold and
insipid. I can only pronounce him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a sensible man, well-bred,
well-informed, of gentle address, and, I believe, possessing an amiable
heart."

<p/>"Miss Dashwood," cried Willoughby, "you are now using me unkindly. You
are endeavouring to disarm me by reason, and to convince me against my
will. But it will not do. You shall find me as stubborn as you can be
artful. I have three unanswerable reasons for disliking Colonel
Brandon; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) threatened me with rain when I wanted it to be fine; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has
found fault with the hanging of my curricle, and I cannot persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
to buy my brown mare. If it will be any satisfaction to you, however,
to be told, that I believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) character to be in other respects
irreproachable, I am ready to confess it. And in return for an
acknowledgment, which must give me some pain, you cannot deny me the
privilege of disliking him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as much as ever."
