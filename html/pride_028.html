<p/>Every object in the next day’s journey was new and interesting to
Elizabeth; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were in a state of enjoyment; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
health, and the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) northern tour was a constant
source of delight.

<p/>When they left the high road for the lane to Hunsford, every eye
was in search of the Parsonage, and every turning expected to
bring it in view. The palings of Rosings Park was their boundary
on one side. Elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had heard of its inhabitants.

<p/>At length the Parsonage was discernible. The garden sloping to
the road, the house standing in it, the green pales, and the
laurel hedge, everything declared they were arriving. Mr. Collins
and Charlotte appeared at the door, and the carriage stopped at
the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house,
amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party. In a moment they
were all out of the chaise, rejoicing at the sight of each other.
Mrs. Collins welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend with the liveliest pleasure, and
Elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found
herself so affectionately received. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw instantly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cousin’s manners were not altered by his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) marriage; his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) formal
civility was just what it had been, and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) detained her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) some
minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) enquiries after all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family. They were then, with no other delay than his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) pointing
out the neatness of the entrance, taken into the house; and as
soon as they were in the parlour, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) welcomed them a second time,
with ostentatious formality to his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) humble abode, and punctually
repeated all his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) wife’s offers of refreshment.

<p/>Elizabeth was prepared to see him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) glory; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not
help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the
room, its aspect and its furniture, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) addressed himself
particularly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as if wishing to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
lost in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). But though everything seemed neat and
comfortable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not able to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) by any sigh of
repentance, and rather looked with wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could have so cheerful an air with such a companion. When Mr.
Collins said anything of which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife might reasonably be
ashamed, which certainly was not unseldom, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) involuntarily
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) eye on Charlotte. Once or twice she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could discern a
faint blush; but in general Charlotte wisely did not hear. After
sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the
room, from the sideboard to the fender, to give an account of
their journey, and of all that had happened in London, Mr.
Collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden, which was
large and well laid out, and to the cultivation of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
attended himself. To work in this garden was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) most
respectable pleasures; and Elizabeth admired the command of
countenance with which Charlotte talked of the healthfulness of
the exercise, and owned she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) encouraged it as much as possible.
Here, leading the way through every walk and cross walk, and
scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked
for, every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left
beauty entirely behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could number the fields in every
direction, and could tell how many trees there were in the most
distant clump. But of all the views which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) garden, or which
the country or kingdom could boast, none were to be compared with
the prospect of Rosings, afforded by an opening in the trees that
bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) house. It was
a handsome modern building, well situated on rising ground.

<p/>From his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) garden, Mr. Collins would have led them round his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) two
meadows; but the ladies, not having shoes to encounter the
remains of a white frost, turned back; and while Sir William
accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), Charlotte took her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister and friend over the
house, extremely well pleased, probably, to have the opportunity
of showing it without her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband’s help. It was rather small,
but well built and convenient; and everything was fitted up and
arranged with a neatness and consistency of which Elizabeth gave
Charlotte all the credit. When Mr. Collins could be forgotten,
there was really an air of great comfort throughout, and by
Charlotte’s evident enjoyment of it, Elizabeth supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) must
be often forgotten.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had already learnt that Lady Catherine was still in the
country. It was spoken of again while they were at dinner, when
Mr. Collins joining in, observed:

<p/>"Yes, Miss Elizabeth, you will have the honour of seeing Lady
Catherine de Bourgh on the ensuing Sunday at church, and I need
not say you will be delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is all affability and
condescension, and I doubt not but you will be honoured with some
portion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice when service is over. I have scarcely any
hesitation in saying she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will include you and my sister Maria in
every invitation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) honours us during your stay here.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour to my dear Charlotte is charming. We dine at
Rosings twice every week, and are never allowed to walk home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
ladyship’s carriage is regularly ordered for us. I _should_ say,
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship’s carriages, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) has several."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lady Catherine is a very respectable, sensible woman indeed,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>added Charlotte, "and a most attentive neighbour."

<p/>"Very true, my dear, that is exactly what I say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is the sort
of woman whom one cannot regard with too much deference."

<p/>The evening was spent chiefly in talking over Hertfordshire news,
and telling again what had already been written; and when it
closed, Elizabeth, in the solitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chamber, had to
meditate upon Charlotte’s degree of contentment, to understand
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) address in guiding, and composure in bearing with, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
husband, and to acknowledge that it was all done very well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
had also to anticipate how her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visit would pass, the quiet tenor
of their usual employments, the vexatious interruptions of Mr.
Collins, and the gaieties of their intercourse with Rosings. A
lively imagination soon settled it all.

<p/>About the middle of the next day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) room getting
ready for a walk, a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole
house in confusion; and, after listening a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) heard
somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry, and calling loudly
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) opened the door and met Maria in the landing
place, who, breathless with agitation, cried out—

<p/>"Oh, my dear Eliza! pray make haste and come into the
dining-room, for there is such a sight to be seen! I will not
tell you what it is. Make haste, and come down this moment.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth asked questions in vain; Maria would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) nothing
more, and down they ran into the dining-room, which fronted the
lane, in quest of this wonder; It was two ladies stopping in a
low phaeton at the garden gate.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And is this all?<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I expected at least that the
pigs were got into the garden, and here is nothing but Lady
Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"La! my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, quite shocked at the mistake, "it is
not Lady Catherine. The old lady is Mrs. Jenkinson, who lives
with them; the other is Miss de Bourgh. Only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is
quite a little creature. Who would have thought that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) could be
so thin and small?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is abominably rude to keep Charlotte out of doors in all
this wind. Why does she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not come in?"

<p/>"Oh, Charlotte says she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hardly ever does. It is the greatest of
favours when Miss de Bourgh comes in."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) appearance,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, struck with other ideas.
"She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looks sickly and cross. Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) will do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) very well.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) will make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) a very proper wife."

<p/>Mr. Collins and Charlotte were both standing at the gate in
conversation with the ladies; and Sir William, to Elizabeth’s
high diversion, was stationed in the doorway, in earnest
contemplation of the greatness before him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and constantly bowing
whenever Miss de Bourgh looked that way.

<p/>At length there was nothing more to be said; the ladies drove on,
and the others returned into the house. Mr. Collins no sooner saw
the two girls than he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) began to congratulate them on their good
fortune, which Charlotte explained by letting them know that the
whole party was asked to dine at Rosings the next day.
