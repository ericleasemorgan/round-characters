<p/>A very little quiet reflection was enough to satisfy Emma as to the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitation on hearing this news of Frank Churchill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was soon convinced that it was not for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was feeling at all apprehensive or embarrassed; it was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attachment had really subsided into a mere nothing; it was not worth thinking of; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), who had undoubtedly been always so much the most in love of the two, were to be returning with the same warmth of sentiment which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had taken away, it would be very distressing. If a separation of two months should not have cooled him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), there were dangers and evils before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): caution for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and for herself would be necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not mean to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affections entangled again, and it would be incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to avoid any encouragement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might be able to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from an absolute declaration. That would be so very painful a conclusion of their present acquaintance! and yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not help rather anticipating something decisive. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt as if the spring would not pass without bringing a crisis, an event, a something to alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present composed and tranquil state.

<p/>It was not very long, though rather longer than Mr. Weston had foreseen, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the power of forming some opinion of Frank Churchill's feelings. The Enscombe family were not in town quite so soon as had been imagined, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was at Highbury very soon afterwards. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) rode down for a couple of hours; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not yet do more; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came from Randalls immediately to Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could then exercise all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick observation, and speedily determine how he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was influenced, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must act. They met with the utmost friendliness. There could be no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) great pleasure in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an almost instant doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) feeling the same tenderness in the same degree. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) well. It was a clear thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was less in love than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been. Absence, with the conviction probably of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indifference, had produced this very natural and very desirable effect.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in high spirits; as ready to talk and laugh as ever, and seemed delighted to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) former visit, and recur to old stories: and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not without agitation. It was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) calmness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) comparative difference. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not calm; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits were evidently fluttered; there was restlessness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Lively as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was, it seemed a liveliness that did not satisfy himself; but what decided her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) belief on the subject, was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) staying only a quarter of an hour, and hurrying away to make other calls in Highbury. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had seen a group of old acquaintance in the street as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) passed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not stopped, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would not stop for more than a word but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had the vanity to think they would be disappointed if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not call, and much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wished to stay longer at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must hurry off."  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being less in love but neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) agitated spirits, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurrying away, seemed like a perfect cure; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was rather inclined to think it implied a dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) returning power, and a discreet resolution of not trusting himself with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) long.

<p/>This was the only visit from Frank Churchill in the course of ten days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was often hoping, intending to come but was always prevented. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt could not bear to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) leave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account at Randall's. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were quite sincere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) really tried to come, it was to be inferred that Mrs. Churchill's removal to London had been of no service to the wilful or nervous part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) disorder. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was really ill was very certain; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had declared himself convinced of it, at Randalls. Though much might be fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not doubt, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked back, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was in a weaker state of health than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been half a year ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not believe it to proceed from any thing that care and medicine might not remove, or at least that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might not have many years of existence before her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be prevailed on, by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's doubts, to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complaints were merely imaginary, or that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was as strong as ever.

<p/>It soon appeared that London was not the place for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not endure its noise. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nerves were under continual irritation and suffering; and by the ten days' end, her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew's letter to Randalls communicated a change of plan. They were going to remove immediately to Richmond. Mrs. Churchill had been recommended to the medical skill of an eminent person there, and had otherwise a fancy for the place. A ready-furnished house in a favourite spot was engaged, and much benefit expected from the change.

<p/>Emma heard that Frank wrote in the highest spirits of this arrangement, and seemed most fully to appreciate the blessing of having two months before him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) of such near neighbourhood to many dear friends for the house was taken for May and June. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was told that now he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) wrote with the greatest confidence of being often with them, almost as often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could even wish.

<p/>Emma saw how Mr. Weston understood these joyous prospects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as the source of all the happiness they offered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped it was not so. Two months must bring it to the proof.

<p/>Mr. Weston's own happiness was indisputable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was quite delighted. It was the very circumstance he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could have wished for. Now, it would be really having Frank in their neighbourhood. What were nine miles to a young man? An hour's ride. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be always coming over. The difference in that respect of Richmond and London was enough to make the whole difference of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never. Sixteen miles nay, eighteen it must be full eighteen to Manchester-street was a serious obstacle. Were he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever able to get away, the day would be spent in coming and returning. There was no comfort in having him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in London; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might as well be at Enscombe; but Richmond was the very distance for easy intercourse. Better than nearer!

<p/>One good thing was immediately brought to a certainty by this removal, the ball at the Crown. It had not been forgotten before, but it had been soon acknowledged vain to attempt to fix a day. Now, however, it was absolutely to be; every preparation was resumed, and very soon after the Churchills had removed to Richmond, a few lines from Frank, to say that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) aunt felt already much better for the change, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had no doubt of being able to join them for twenty-four hours at any given time, induced them to name as early a day as possible.

<p/>Mr. Weston's ball was to be a real thing. A very few to-morrows stood between the young people of Highbury and happiness.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was resigned. The time of year lightened the evil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). May was better for every thing than February. Mrs. Bates was engaged to spend the evening at Hartfield, James had due notice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sanguinely hoped that neither dear little Henry nor dear little John would have any thing the matter with them, while dear Emma were gone.
