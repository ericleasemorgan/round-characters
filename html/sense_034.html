<p/>Mrs. John Dashwood had so much confidence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband’s judgment,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) waited the very next day both on Mrs. Jennings and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
daughter; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) confidence was rewarded by finding even the former,
even the woman with whom her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sisters were staying, by no means unworthy
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) notice; and as for Lady Middleton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) one of the most
charming women in the world!

<p/>Lady Middleton was equally pleased with Mrs. Dashwood. There was a kind
of cold hearted selfishness on both sides, which mutually attracted
them; and they sympathised with each other in an insipid propriety of
demeanor, and a general want of understanding.

<p/>The same manners, however, which recommended Mrs. John Dashwood to the
good opinion of Lady Middleton did not suit the fancy of Mrs. Jennings,
and to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) appeared nothing more than a little proud-looking
woman of uncordial address, who met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) husband’s sisters without any
affection, and almost without having anything to say to them; for of
the quarter of an hour bestowed on Berkeley Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sat at least
seven minutes and a half in silence.

<p/>Elinor wanted very much to know, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not chuse to ask,
whether Edward was then in town; but nothing would have induced Fanny
voluntarily to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), till able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marriage with Miss Morton was resolved on, or till her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) husband’s
expectations on Colonel Brandon were answered; because she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) believed
them still so very much attached to each other, that they could not be
too sedulously divided in word and deed on every occasion. The
intelligence however, which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)_ would not give, soon flowed from
another quarter. Lucy came very shortly to claim Elinor’s compassion on
being unable to see Edward, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had arrived in town with Mr. and
Mrs. Dashwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not come to Bartlett’s Buildings for fear of
detection, and though their mutual impatience to meet, was not to be
told, they could do nothing at present but write.

<p/>Edward assured them himself of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being in town, within a very short
time, by twice calling in Berkeley Street. Twice was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) card found on
the table, when they returned from their morning’s engagements. Elinor
was pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had called; and still more pleased that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
missed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>The Dashwoods were so prodigiously delighted with the Middletons, that,
though not much in the habit of giving anything, they determined to
give them—a dinner; and soon after their acquaintance began, invited
them to dine in Harley Street, where they had taken a very good house
for three months. Their sisters and Mrs. Jennings were invited
likewise, and John Dashwood was careful to secure Colonel Brandon, who,
always glad to be where the Miss Dashwoods were, received his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eager
civilities with some surprise, but much more pleasure. They were to
meet Mrs. Ferrars; but Elinor could not learn whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sons were to
be of the party. The expectation of seeing _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_, however, was enough
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) interested in the engagement; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now meet
Edward’s mother without that strong anxiety which had once promised to
attend such an introduction, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could now see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with perfect
indifference as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) desire of being in
company with Mrs. Ferrars, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) curiosity to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was like, was
as lively as ever.

<p/>The interest with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) thus anticipated the party, was soon
afterwards increased, more powerfully than pleasantly, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) hearing
that the Miss Steeles were also to be at it.

<p/>So well had they recommended themselves to Lady Middleton, so agreeable
had their assiduities made them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>), that though Lucy was certainly
not so elegant, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister not even genteel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was as ready as
Sir John to ask them to spend a week or two in Conduit Street; and it
happened to be particularly convenient to the Miss Steeles, as soon as
the Dashwoods’ invitation was known, that their visit should begin a
few days before the party took place.

<p/>Their claims to the notice of Mrs. John Dashwood, as the nieces of the
gentleman who for many years had had the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) brother, might not
have done much, however, towards procuring them seats at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) table; but
as Lady Middleton’s guests they must be welcome; and Lucy, who had long
wanted to be personally known to the family, to have a nearer view of
their characters and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own difficulties, and to have an opportunity
of endeavouring to please them, had seldom been happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life,
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was on receiving Mrs. John Dashwood’s card.

<p/>On Elinor its effect was very different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began immediately to
determine, that Edward who lived with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, must be asked as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mother was, to a party given by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister; and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for the
first time, after all that passed, in the company of Lucy!—she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) hardly
knew how she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could bear it!

<p/>These apprehensions, perhaps, were not founded entirely on reason, and
certainly not at all on truth. They were relieved however, not by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
own recollection, but by the good will of Lucy, who believed herself to
be inflicting a severe disappointment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that Edward
certainly would not be in Harley Street on Tuesday, and even hoped to
be carrying the pain still farther by persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was kept
away by the extreme affection for herself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could not conceal
when they were together.

<p/>The important Tuesday came that was to introduce the two young ladies
to this formidable mother-in-law.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pity me, dear Miss Dashwood!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, as they walked up the stairs
together—for the Middletons arrived so directly after Mrs. Jennings,
that they all followed the servant at the same time:—"there is nobody
here but you, that can feel for me. I declare I can hardly stand. Good
gracious! In a moment I shall see the person that all my happiness
depends on—that is to be my mother!"

<p/>Elinor could have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediate relief by suggesting the
possibility of its being Miss Morton’s mother, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own,
whom they were about to behold; but instead of doing that, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) assured
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and with great sincerity, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) did pity her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)—to the utter
amazement of Lucy, who, though really uncomfortable herself, hoped at
least to be an object of irrepressible envy to Elinor.

<p/>Mrs. Ferrars was a little, thin woman, upright, even to formality, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) figure, and serious, even to sourness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) aspect. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
complexion was sallow; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) features small, without beauty, and
naturally without expression; but a lucky contraction of the brow had
rescued her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) countenance from the disgrace of insipidity, by giving it
the strong characters of pride and ill nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was not a woman of
many words; for, unlike people in general, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) proportioned them to the
number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) ideas; and of the few syllables that did escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), not
one fell to the share of Miss Dashwood, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eyed with the spirited
determination of disliking her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) at all events.

<p/>Elinor could not _now_ be made unhappy by this behaviour. A few months
ago it would have hurt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exceedingly; but it was not in Mrs. Ferrars’
power to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) by it now; and the difference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) manners to
the Miss Steeles, a difference which seemed purposely made to humble
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) more, only amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) could not but smile to see the
graciousness of both mother and daughter towards the very person—for
Lucy was particularly distinguished—whom of all others, had they known
as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did, they would have been most anxious to mortify; while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) herself, who had comparatively no power to wound them, sat
pointedly slighted by both. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) smiled at a graciousness so
misapplied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not reflect on the mean-spirited folly from which
it sprung, nor observe the studied attentions with which the Miss
Steeles courted its continuance, without thoroughly despising them all
four.

<p/>Lucy was all exultation on being so honorably distinguished; and Miss
Steele wanted only to be teazed about Dr. Davies to be perfectly happy.

<p/>The dinner was a grand one, the servants were numerous, and every thing
bespoke the Mistress’s inclination for show, and the Master’s ability
to support it. In spite of the improvements and additions which were
making to the Norland estate, and in spite of its owner having once
been within some thousand pounds of being obliged to sell out at a
loss, nothing gave any symptom of that indigence which he (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) had tried to
infer from it;—no poverty of any kind, except of conversation,
appeared—but there, the deficiency was considerable. John Dashwood had
not much to say for himself that was worth hearing, and his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) wife had
still less. But there was no peculiar disgrace in this; for it was very
much the case with the chief of their visitors, who almost all laboured
under one or other of these disqualifications for being agreeable—Want
of sense, either natural or improved—want of elegance—want of
spirits—or want of temper.

<p/>When the ladies withdrew to the drawing-room after dinner, this poverty
was particularly evident, for the gentlemen _had_ supplied the
discourse with some variety—the variety of politics, inclosing land,
and breaking horses—but then it was all over; and one subject only
engaged the ladies till coffee came in, which was the comparative
heights of Harry Dashwood, and Lady Middleton’s second son William, who
were nearly of the same age.

<p/>Had both the children been there, the affair might have been determined
too easily by measuring them at once; but as Harry only was present, it
was all conjectural assertion on both sides; and every body had a right
to be equally positive in their opinion, and to repeat it over and over
again as often as they liked.

<p/>The parties stood thus:

<p/>The two mothers, though each really convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own son was the
tallest, politely decided in favour of the other.

<p/>The two grandmothers, with not less partiality, but more sincerity,
were equally earnest in support of their own descendant.

<p/>Lucy, who was hardly less anxious to please one parent than the other,
thought the boys were both remarkably tall for their age, and could not
conceive that there could be the smallest difference in the world
between them; and Miss Steele, with yet greater address gave it, as
fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could, in favour of each.

<p/>Elinor, having once delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion on William’s side, by which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) offended Mrs. Ferrars and Fanny still more, did not see the
necessity of enforcing it by any farther assertion; and Marianne, when
called on for hers, offended them all, by declaring that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no
opinion to give, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had never thought about it.

<p/>Before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) removing from Norland, Elinor had painted a very pretty pair
of screens for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law, which being now just mounted and
brought home, ornamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) present drawing room; and these screens,
catching the eye of John Dashwood on his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) following the other gentlemen
into the room, were officiously handed by him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to Colonel Brandon for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) admiration.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"These are done by my eldest sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>); "and you, as a man of
taste, will, I dare say, be pleased with them. I do not know whether
you have ever happened to see any of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) performances before, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
is in general reckoned to draw extremely well."

<p/>The Colonel, though disclaiming all pretensions to connoisseurship,
warmly admired the screens, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) would have done any thing painted by
Miss Dashwood; and on the curiosity of the others being of course
excited, they were handed round for general inspection. Mrs. Ferrars,
not aware of their being Elinor’s work, particularly requested to look
at them; and after they had received gratifying testimony of Lady
Middletons’s approbation, Fanny presented them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother,
considerately informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), at the same time, that they were done by
Miss Dashwood.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Hum" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars</b></font>)</div>—said Mrs. Ferrars—<div class="bookquote">"very pretty," (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars</b></font>)</div>—and without regarding them at
all, returned them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughter.

<p/>Perhaps Fanny thought for a moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother had been quite rude
enough,—for, colouring a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) immediately said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They are very pretty, ma’am—an’t they?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But then again, the dread of
having been too civil, too encouraging herself, probably came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently added,

<p/>"Do you not think they are something in Miss Morton’s style of
painting, Ma’am?—_She (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) does_ paint most delightfully!—How beautifully
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) last landscape is done!"

<p/>"Beautifully indeed! But _she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)_ does every thing well."

<p/>Marianne could not bear this.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was already greatly displeased with
Mrs. Ferrars; and such ill-timed praise of another, at Elinor’s
expense, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not any notion of what was principally meant by
it, provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately to say with warmth,

<p/>"This is admiration of a very particular kind!—what is Miss Morton to
us?—who knows, or who cares, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>)?—it is Elinor of whom _we_ think
and speak.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And so saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) took the screens out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law’s hands,
to admire them herself as they ought to be admired.

<p/>Mrs. Ferrars looked exceedingly angry, and drawing herself up more
stiffly than ever, pronounced in retort this bitter philippic, " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Morton</b></font>)</div>Miss
Morton is Lord Morton’s daughter."

<p/>Fanny looked very angry too, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) husband was all in a fright at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
sister’s audacity. Elinor was much more hurt by Marianne’s warmth than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been by what produced it; but Colonel Brandon’s eyes, as they
were fixed on Marianne, declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) noticed only what was amiable
in it, the affectionate heart which could not bear to see a sister
slighted in the smallest point.

<p/>Marianne’s feelings did not stop here. The cold insolence of Mrs.
Ferrars’s general behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) sister, seemed, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), to foretell
such difficulties and distresses to Elinor, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wounded heart
taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to think of with horror; and urged by a strong impulse of
affectionate sensibility, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved after a moment, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s
chair, and putting one arm round her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) neck, and one cheek close to hers,
said in a low, but eager, voice,

<p/>"Dear, dear Elinor, don’t mind them. Don’t let them make _you_
unhappy.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could say no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were quite overcome, and hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
face on Elinor’s shoulder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) burst into tears. Every body’s attention
was called, and almost every body was concerned.—Colonel Brandon rose
up and went to them without knowing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) did.—Mrs. Jennings, with a
very intelligent " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ah! poor dear," immediately gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) salts; and
Sir John felt so desperately enraged against the author of this nervous
distress, that he (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) instantly changed his (<font color='blue'><b>author</b></font>) seat to one close by Lucy
Steele, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), in a whisper, a brief account of the whole
shocking affair.

<p/>In a few minutes, however, Marianne was recovered enough to put an end
to the bustle, and sit down among the rest; though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits retained
the impression of what had passed, the whole evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor Marianne!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother to Colonel Brandon, in a low voice,
as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could secure his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) attention: "She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not such good health
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is very nervous,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has not Elinor’s
constitution;—and one must allow that there is something very trying to
a young woman who _has been_ a beauty in the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) personal
attractions. You would not think it perhaps, but Marianne _was_
remarkably handsome a few months ago; quite as handsome as Elinor. Now
you see it is all gone."
