<p/>The day at Sotherton, with all its imperfections, afforded the Miss
Bertrams much more agreeable feelings than were derived from the
letters from Antigua, which soon afterwards reached Mansfield. It was
much pleasanter to think of Henry Crawford than of their father; and to
think of their father in England again within a certain period, which
these letters obliged them to do, was a most unwelcome exercise.

<p/>November was the black month fixed for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) return. Sir Thomas wrote of
it with as much decision as experience and anxiety could authorise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
business was so nearly concluded as to justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in proposing to take
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage in the September packet, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) consequently looked forward
with the hope of being with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) beloved family again early in November.

<p/>Maria was more to be pitied than Julia; for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) the father brought a
husband, and the return of the friend most solicitous for her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) happiness
would unite her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) to the lover, on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had chosen that happiness
should depend. It was a gloomy prospect, and all she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) could do was to
throw a mist over it, and hope when the mist cleared away she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) should
see something else. It would hardly be _early_ in November, there were
generally delays, a bad passage or _something_; that favouring
_something_ which everybody who shuts their eyes while they look, or
their understandings while they reason, feels the comfort of. It would
probably be the middle of November at least; the middle of November was
three months off. Three months comprised thirteen weeks. Much might
happen in thirteen weeks.

<p/>Sir Thomas would have been deeply mortified by a suspicion of half that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters felt on the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) return, and would hardly have
found consolation in a knowledge of the interest it excited in the
breast of another young lady. Miss Crawford, on walking up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
brother to spend the evening at Mansfield Park, heard the good news;
and though seeming to have no concern in the affair beyond politeness,
and to have vented all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) feelings in a quiet congratulation, heard it
with an attention not so easily satisfied. Mrs. Norris gave the
particulars of the letters, and the subject was dropt; but after tea,
as Miss Crawford was standing at an open window with Edmund and Fanny
looking out on a twilight scene, while the Miss Bertrams, Mr.
Rushworth, and Henry Crawford were all busy with candles at the
pianoforte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) suddenly revived it by turning round towards the group,
and saying, "How happy Mr. Rushworth looks! He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is thinking of
November.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Edmund looked round at Mr. Rushworth too, but had nothing to say.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Your father’s return will be a very interesting event."

<p/>"It will, indeed, after such an absence; an absence not only long, but
including so many dangers."

<p/>"It will be the forerunner also of other interesting events: your
sister’s marriage, and your taking orders."

<p/>"Yes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Don’t be affronted,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), laughing, "but it does put me in mind
of some of the old heathen heroes, who, after performing great exploits
in a foreign land, offered sacrifices to the gods on their safe
return."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no sacrifice in the case,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>replied Edmund, with a serious
smile, and glancing at the pianoforte again; "it is entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own
doing."

<p/>"Oh yes I know it is. I was merely joking. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has done no more than
what every young woman would do; and I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being
extremely happy. My other sacrifice, of course, you do not understand."

<p/>"My taking orders, I assure you, is quite as voluntary as Maria’s
marrying."

<p/>"It is fortunate that your inclination and your father’s convenience
should accord so well. There is a very good living kept for you, I
understand, hereabouts."

<p/>"Which you suppose has biassed me?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But _that_ I am sure it has not,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny.

<p/>"Thank you for your good word, Fanny, but it is more than I would
affirm myself. On the contrary, the knowing that there was such a
provision for me probably did bias me. Nor can I think it wrong that it
should. There was no natural disinclination to be overcome, and I see
no reason why a man should make a worse clergyman for knowing that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
will have a competence early in life. I was in safe hands. I hope I
should not have been influenced myself in a wrong way, and I am sure my
father was too conscientious to have allowed it. I have no doubt that I
was biased, but I think it was blamelessly."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is the same sort of thing,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a short pause, "as
for the son of an admiral to go into the navy, or the son of a general
to be in the army, and nobody sees anything wrong in that. Nobody
wonders that they should prefer the line where their friends can serve
them best, or suspects them to be less in earnest in it than they
appear."

<p/>"No, my dear Miss Price, and for reasons good. The profession, either
navy or army, is its own justification. It has everything in its
favour: heroism, danger, bustle, fashion. Soldiers and sailors are
always acceptable in society. Nobody can wonder that men are soldiers
and sailors."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But the motives of a man who takes orders with the certainty of
preferment may be fairly suspected, you think?"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund. "To be
justified in your eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must do it in the most complete uncertainty
of any provision."

<p/>"What! take orders without a living! No; that is madness indeed;
absolute madness."

<p/>"Shall I ask you how the church is to be filled, if a man is neither to
take orders with a living nor without? No; for you certainly would not
know what to say. But I must beg some advantage to the clergyman from
your own argument. As he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) cannot be influenced by those feelings which
you rank highly as temptation and reward to the soldier and sailor in
their choice of a profession, as heroism, and noise, and fashion, are
all against him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) ought to be less liable to the suspicion of wanting
sincerity or good intentions in the choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)."

<p/>"Oh! no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) is very sincere in preferring an income ready made, to
the trouble of working for one; and has the best intentions of doing
nothing all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) days but eat, drink, and grow fat. It is
indolence, Mr. Bertram, indeed. Indolence and love of ease; a want of
all laudable ambition, of taste for good company, or of inclination to
take the trouble of being agreeable, which make men clergymen. A
clergyman has nothing to do but be slovenly and selfish—read the
newspaper, watch the weather, and quarrel with his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife. His (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) curate
does all the work, and the business of his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) own life is to dine."

<p/>"There are such clergymen, no doubt, but I think they are not so common
as to justify Miss Crawford in esteeming it their general character. I
suspect that in this comprehensive and (may I say) commonplace censure,
you are not judging from yourself, but from prejudiced persons, whose
opinions you have been in the habit of hearing. It is impossible that
your own observation can have given you much knowledge of the clergy.
You can have been personally acquainted with very few of a set of men
you condemn so conclusively. You are speaking what you have been told
at your uncle’s table."

<p/>"I speak what appears to me the general opinion; and where an opinion
is general, it is usually correct. Though _I_ have not seen much of the
domestic lives of clergymen, it is seen by too many to leave any
deficiency of information."

<p/>"Where any one body of educated men, of whatever denomination, are
condemned indiscriminately, there must be a deficiency of information,
or (smiling) of something else. Your uncle, and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) brother admirals,
perhaps knew little of clergymen beyond the chaplains whom, good or
bad, they were always wishing away."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor William! He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has met with great kindness from the chaplain of the
Antwerp,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>was a tender apostrophe of Fanny’s, very much to the purpose
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own feelings if not of the conversation.

<p/>"I have been so little addicted to take my opinions from my uncle,"
said Miss Crawford, "that I can hardly suppose—and since you push me so
hard, I must observe, that I am not entirely without the means of
seeing what clergymen are, being at this present time the guest of my
own brother, Dr. Grant. And though Dr. Grant is most kind and obliging
to me, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is really a gentleman, and, I dare say, a good
scholar and clever, and often preaches good sermons, and is very
respectable, _I_ see him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) to be an indolent, selfish _bon_ _vivant_, who
must have his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) palate consulted in everything; who will not stir a
finger for the convenience of any one; and who, moreover, if the cook
makes a blunder, is out of humour with his (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) excellent wife. To own the
truth, Henry and I were partly driven out this very evening by a
disappointment about a green goose, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could not get the better
of. My poor sister was forced to stay and bear it."

<p/>"I do not wonder at your disapprobation, upon my word. It is a great
defect of temper, made worse by a very faulty habit of self-indulgence;
and to see your sister suffering from it must be exceedingly painful to
such feelings as yours. Fanny, it goes against us. We cannot attempt to
defend Dr. Grant."

<p/>"No,<div class="bookquote">" replied Fanny, " (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>but we need not give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) profession for all
that; because, whatever profession Dr. Grant had chosen, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have
taken a—not a good temper into it; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) must, either in the navy
or army, have had a great many more people under his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) command than he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
has now, I think more would have been made unhappy by him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) as a sailor
or soldier than as a clergyman. Besides, I cannot but suppose that
whatever there may be to wish otherwise in Dr. Grant would have been in
a greater danger of becoming worse in a more active and worldly
profession, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would have had less time and obligation—where he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
might have escaped that knowledge of himself, the _frequency_, at
least, of that knowledge which it is impossible he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) should escape as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
is now. A man—a sensible man like Dr. Grant, cannot be in the habit of
teaching others their duty every week, cannot go to church twice every
Sunday, and preach such very good sermons in so good a manner as he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
does, without being the better for it himself. It must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) think;
and I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) oftener endeavours to restrain himself than
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would if he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had been anything but a clergyman."

<p/>"We cannot prove to the contrary, to be sure; but I wish you a better
fate, Miss Price, than to be the wife of a man whose amiableness
depends upon his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sermons; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may preach himself into a
good-humour every Sunday, it will be bad enough to have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quarrelling
about green geese from Monday morning till Saturday night."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I think the man who could often quarrel with Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund
affectionately, "must be beyond the reach of any sermons."

<p/>Fanny turned farther into the window; and Miss Crawford had only time
to say, in a pleasant manner, <div class="bookquote">"I fancy Miss Price has been more used to
deserve praise than to hear it" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>; when, being earnestly invited by the
Miss Bertrams to join in a glee, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) tripped off to the instrument,
leaving Edmund looking after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) in an ecstasy of admiration of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>)
many virtues, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) obliging manners down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) light and graceful
tread.

<p/>"There goes good-humour, I am sure," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) presently. "There goes a
temper which would never give pain! How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) walks! and how readily
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) falls in with the inclination of others! joining them the moment
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) is asked. What a pity," he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) added, after an instant’s reflection,
"that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) should have been in such hands!"

<p/>Fanny agreed to it, and had the pleasure of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continue at the
window with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in spite of the expected glee; and of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eyes
soon turned, like hers, towards the scene without, where all that was
solemn, and soothing, and lovely, appeared in the brilliancy of an
unclouded night, and the contrast of the deep shade of the woods. Fanny
spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings. <div class="bookquote">"Here’s harmony!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); "here’s repose! Here’s
what may leave all painting and all music behind, and what poetry only
can attempt to describe! Here’s what may tranquillise every care, and
lift the heart to rapture! When I look out on such a night as this, I
feel as if there could be neither wickedness nor sorrow in the world;
and there certainly would be less of both if the sublimity of Nature
were more attended to, and people were carried more out of themselves
by contemplating such a scene."

<p/>"I like to hear your enthusiasm, Fanny. It is a lovely night, and they
are much to be pitied who have not been taught to feel, in some degree,
as you do; who have not, at least, been given a taste for Nature in
early life. They lose a great deal."

<p/>"_You_ taught me to think and feel on the subject, cousin."

<p/>"I had a very apt scholar. There’s Arcturus looking very bright."

<p/>"Yes, and the Bear. I wish I could see Cassiopeia."

<p/>"We must go out on the lawn for that. Should you be afraid?"

<p/>"Not in the least. It is a great while since we have had any
star-gazing."

<p/>"Yes; I do not know how it has happened.<div class="bookquote">" The glee began. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>We will stay
till this is finished, Fanny," said he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) back on the window;
and as it advanced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had the mortification of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) advance
too, moving forward by gentle degrees towards the instrument, and when
it ceased, he (<font color='blue'><b>scholar</b></font>) was close by the singers, among the most urgent in
requesting to hear the glee again.

<p/>Fanny sighed alone at the window till scolded away by Mrs. Norris’s
threats of catching cold.
