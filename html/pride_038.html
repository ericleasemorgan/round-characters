<p/>On Saturday morning Elizabeth and Mr. Collins met for breakfast a
few minutes before the others appeared; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took the
opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) deemed
indispensably necessary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know not, Miss Elizabeth,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), "whether Mrs. Collins has
yet expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) sense of your kindness in coming to us; but I
am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thanks for it. The favour of your company has been much felt,
I assure you. We know how little there is to tempt anyone to our
humble abode. Our plain manner of living, our small rooms and few
domestics, and the little we see of the world, must make Hunsford
extremely dull to a young lady like yourself; but I hope you will
believe us grateful for the condescension, and that we have done
everything in our power to prevent your spending your time
unpleasantly."

<p/>Elizabeth was eager with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thanks and assurances of happiness.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had spent six weeks with great enjoyment; and the pleasure of
being with Charlotte, and the kind attentions she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had received,
must make _her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)_ feel the obliged. Mr. Collins was gratified, and
with a more smiling solemnity replied:

<p/>"It gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your
time not disagreeably. We have certainly done our best; and most
fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very
superior society, and, from our connection with Rosings, the
frequent means of varying the humble home scene, I think we may
flatter ourselves that your Hunsford visit cannot have been
entirely irksome. Our situation with regard to Lady Catherine’s
family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing
which few can boast. You see on what a footing we are. You see
how continually we are engaged there. In truth I must acknowledge
that, with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage, I
should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion,
while they are sharers of our intimacy at Rosings.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Words were insufficient for the elevation of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) feelings; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
was obliged to walk about the room, while Elizabeth tried to
unite civility and truth in a few short sentences.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>You may, in fact, carry a very favourable report of us into
Hertfordshire, my dear cousin. I flatter myself at least that you
will be able to do so. Lady Catherine’s great attentions to Mrs.
Collins you have been a daily witness of; and altogether I trust
it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunate—but
on this point it will be as well to be silent. Only let me assure
you, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that I can from my heart most
cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage. My dear Charlotte
and I have but one mind and one way of thinking. There is in
everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas
between us. We seem to have been designed for each other."

<p/>Elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where
that was the case, and with equal sincerity could add, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
firmly believed and rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) domestic comforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
not sorry, however, to have the recital of them interrupted by
the lady from whom they sprang. Poor Charlotte! it was melancholy
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to such society! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had chosen it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) eyes
open; and though evidently regretting that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) visitors were to
go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not seem to ask for compassion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) home and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
housekeeping, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) parish and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) poultry, and all their dependent
concerns, had not yet lost their charms.

<p/>At length the chaise arrived, the trunks were fastened on, the
parcels placed within, and it was pronounced to be ready. After
an affectionate parting between the friends, Elizabeth was
attended to the carriage by Mr. Collins, and as they walked down
the garden he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was commissioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) best respects to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, not forgetting his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thanks for the kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had
received at Longbourn in the winter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) compliments to Mr.
and Mrs. Gardiner, though unknown. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) then handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in, Maria
followed, and the door was on the point of being closed, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
suddenly reminded them, with some consternation, that they had
hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at
Rosings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">"you will of course wish to have your humble
respects delivered to them, with your grateful thanks for their
kindness to you while you have been here."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no objection; the door was then allowed to be
shut, and the carriage drove off.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Good gracious!"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>cried Maria, after a few minutes’ silence, "it
seems but a day or two since we first came! and yet how many
things have happened!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A great many indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) companion with a sigh.

<p/>"We have dined nine times at Rosings, besides drinking tea there
twice! How much I shall have to tell!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth added privately, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And how much I shall have to
conceal!"

<p/>Their journey was performed without much conversation, or any
alarm; and within four hours of their leaving Hunsford they
reached Mr. Gardiner’s house, where they were to remain a few
days.

<p/>Jane looked well, and Elizabeth had little opportunity of
studying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits, amidst the various engagements which the
kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt had reserved for them. But Jane was to go
home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and at Longbourn there would be leisure enough for
observation.

<p/>It was not without an effort, meanwhile, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could wait even
for Longbourn, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister of Mr. Darcy’s
proposals. To know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the power of revealing what would
so exceedingly astonish Jane, and must, at the same time, so
highly gratify whatever of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own vanity she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had not yet been
able to reason away, was such a temptation to openness as nothing
could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
remained as to the extent of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should communicate; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
fear, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) once entered on the subject, of being hurried into
repeating something of Bingley which might only grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister
further.
