<p/>After some opposition, Marianne yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s entreaties, and
consented to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and Mrs. Jennings one morning for half an
hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) expressly conditioned, however, for paying no visits, and
would do no more than accompany them to Gray’s in Sackville Street,
where Elinor was carrying on a negotiation for the exchange of a few
old-fashioned jewels of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>When they stopped at the door, Mrs. Jennings recollected that there was
a lady at the other end of the street on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ought to call; and as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had no business at Gray’s, it was resolved, that while her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young
friends transacted their’s, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) visit and return for
them.

<p/>On ascending the stairs, the Miss Dashwoods found so many people before
them in the room, that there was not a person at liberty to tend to
their orders; and they were obliged to wait. All that could be done
was, to sit down at that end of the counter which seemed to promise the
quickest succession; one gentleman only was standing there, and it is
probable that Elinor was not without hope of exciting his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness to
a quicker despatch. But the correctness of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eye, and the delicacy of
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) taste, proved to be beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) politeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was giving orders for
a toothpick-case for himself, and till its size, shape, and ornaments
were determined, all of which, after examining and debating for a
quarter of an hour over every toothpick-case in the shop, were finally
arranged by his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own inventive fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had no leisure to bestow any
other attention on the two ladies, than what was comprised in three or
four very broad stares; a kind of notice which served to imprint on
Elinor the remembrance of a person and face, of strong, natural,
sterling insignificance, though adorned in the first style of fashion.

<p/>Marianne was spared from the troublesome feelings of contempt and
resentment, on this impertinent examination of their features, and on
the puppyism of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manner in deciding on all the different horrors of
the different toothpick-cases presented to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) inspection, by remaining
unconscious of it all; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as well able to collect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
within herself, and be as ignorant of what was passing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), in
Mr. Gray’s shop, as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own bedroom.

<p/>At last the affair was decided. The ivory, the gold, and the pearls,
all received their appointment, and the gentleman having named the last
day on which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) existence could be continued without the possession of
the toothpick-case, drew on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gloves with leisurely care, and
bestowing another glance on the Miss Dashwoods, but such a one as
seemed rather to demand than express admiration, walked off with a
happy air of real conceit and affected indifference.

<p/>Elinor lost no time in bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) business forward, was on the point
of concluding it, when another gentleman presented himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) side.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes towards his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) face, and found him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with some surprise
to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother.

<p/>Their affection and pleasure in meeting was just enough to make a very
creditable appearance in Mr. Gray’s shop. John Dashwood was really far
from being sorry to see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) sisters again; it rather gave them
satisfaction; and his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) inquiries after their mother were respectful and
attentive.

<p/>Elinor found that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) and Fanny had been in town two days.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wished very much to call upon you yesterday,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), "but it was
impossible, for we were obliged to take Harry to see the wild beasts at
Exeter Exchange; and we spent the rest of the day with Mrs. Ferrars.
Harry was vastly pleased. _This_ morning I had fully intended to call
on you, if I could possibly find a spare half hour, but one has always
so much to do on first coming to town. I am come here to bespeak Fanny
a seal. But tomorrow I think I shall certainly be able to call in
Berkeley Street, and be introduced to your friend Mrs. Jennings. I
understand she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is a woman of very good fortune. And the Middletons too,
you must introduce me to _them_. As my mother-in-law’s relations, I
shall be happy to show them every respect. They are excellent
neighbours to you in the country, I understand."

<p/>"Excellent indeed. Their attention to our comfort, their friendliness
in every particular, is more than I can express."

<p/>"I am extremely glad to hear it, upon my word; extremely glad indeed.
But so it ought to be; they are people of large fortune, they are
related to you, and every civility and accommodation that can serve to
make your situation pleasant might be reasonably expected. And so you
are most comfortably settled in your little cottage and want for
nothing! Edward brought us a most charming account of the place: the
most complete thing of its kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, that ever was, and you all
seemed to enjoy it beyond any thing. It was a great satisfaction to us
to hear it, I assure you."

<p/>Elinor did feel a little ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and was not sorry to
be spared the necessity of answering him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by the arrival of Mrs.
Jennings’s servant, who came to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) mistress waited for
them at the door.

<p/>Mr. Dashwood attended them down stairs, was introduced to Mrs. Jennings
at the door of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) carriage, and repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hope of being able to
call on them the next day, took leave.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) visit was duly paid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) came with a pretence at an apology from
their sister-in-law, for not coming too; <div class="bookquote">"but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was so much engaged
with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother, that really she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had no leisure for going any where."
 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Jennings, however, assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) directly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should not stand
upon ceremony, for they were all cousins, or something like it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
should certainly wait on Mrs. John Dashwood very soon, and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sisters to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) manners to _them_, though calm, were perfectly
kind; to Mrs. Jennings, most attentively civil; and on Colonel
Brandon’s coming in soon after himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) with a curiosity
which seemed to say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) only wanted to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to be rich, to be
equally civil to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)_.

<p/>After staying with them half an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) asked Elinor to walk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
to Conduit Street, and introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to Sir John and Lady Middleton.
The weather was remarkably fine, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) readily consented. As soon as
they were out of the house, his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) enquiries began.

<p/>"Who is Colonel Brandon? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) a man of fortune?"

<p/>"Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has very good property in Dorsetshire."

<p/>"I am glad of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) seems a most gentlemanlike man; and I think,
Elinor, I may congratulate you on the prospect of a very respectable
establishment in life."

<p/>"Me, brother! what do you mean?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) likes you. I observed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) narrowly, and am convinced of it. What is
the amount of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fortune?"

<p/>"I believe about two thousand a year."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Two thousand a-year;"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and then working himself up to a pitch of
enthusiastic generosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, "Elinor, I wish with all my heart it
were _twice_ as much, for your sake."

<p/>"Indeed I believe you," replied Elinor; "but I am very sure that
Colonel Brandon has not the smallest wish of marrying _me_."

<p/>"You are mistaken, Elinor; you are very much mistaken. A very little
trouble on your side secures him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). Perhaps just at present he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) may be
undecided; the smallness of your fortune may make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hang back; his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
friends may all advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) against it. But some of those little
attentions and encouragements which ladies can so easily give will fix
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), in spite of himself. And there can be no reason why you should not
try for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). It is not to be supposed that any prior attachment on your
side—in short, you know as to an attachment of that kind, it is quite
out of the question, the objections are insurmountable—you have too
much sense not to see all that. Colonel Brandon must be the man; and no
civility shall be wanting on my part to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) pleased with you and
your family. It is a match that must give universal satisfaction. In
short, it is a kind of thing that"—lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) voice to an important
whisper—"will be exceedingly welcome to _all parties_." Recollecting
himself, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) added, "That is, I mean to say—your friends are
all truly anxious to see you well settled; Fanny particularly, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
has your interest very much at heart, I assure you. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother too,
Mrs. Ferrars, a very good-natured woman, I am sure it would give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
great pleasure; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said as much the other day.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor would not vouchsafe any answer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It would be something remarkable, now," he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) continued, "something
droll, if Fanny should have a brother and I a sister settling at the
same time. And yet it is not very unlikely."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is Mr. Edward Ferrars,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with resolution, "going to be
married?"

<p/>"It is not actually settled, but there is such a thing in agitation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
has a most excellent mother. Mrs. Ferrars, with the utmost liberality,
will come forward, and settle on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a thousand a year, if the match
takes place. The lady is the Hon. Miss Morton, only daughter of the
late Lord Morton, with thirty thousand pounds. A very desirable
connection on both sides, and I have not a doubt of its taking place in
time. A thousand a-year is a great deal for a mother to give away, to
make over for ever; but Mrs. Ferrars has a noble spirit. To give you
another instance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) liberality:—The other day, as soon as we came
to town, aware that money could not be very plenty with us just now,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) put bank-notes into Fanny’s hands to the amount of two hundred
pounds. And extremely acceptable it is, for we must live at a great
expense while we are here."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) paused for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) assent and compassion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forced herself to say,

<p/>"Your expenses both in town and country must certainly be considerable;
but your income is a large one."

<p/>"Not so large, I dare say, as many people suppose. I do not mean to
complain, however; it is undoubtedly a comfortable one, and I hope will
in time be better. The enclosure of Norland Common, now carrying on, is
a most serious drain. And then I have made a little purchase within
this half year; East Kingham Farm, you must remember the place, where
old Gibson used to live. The land was so very desirable for me in every
respect, so immediately adjoining my own property, that I felt it my
duty to buy it. I could not have answered it to my conscience to let it
fall into any other hands. A man must pay for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) convenience; and it
_has_ cost me a vast deal of money."

<p/>"More than you think it really and intrinsically worth."

<p/>"Why, I hope not that. I might have sold it again, the next day, for
more than I gave: but, with regard to the purchase-money, I might have
been very unfortunate indeed; for the stocks were at that time so low,
that if I had not happened to have the necessary sum in my banker’s
hands, I must have sold out to very great loss.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor could only smile.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Other great and inevitable expenses too we have had on first coming to
Norland. Our respected father, as you well know, bequeathed all the
Stanhill effects that remained at Norland (and very valuable they were)
to your mother. Far be it from me to repine at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) doing so; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had an
undoubted right to dispose of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own property as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) chose, but, in
consequence of it, we have been obliged to make large purchases of
linen, china, &c. to supply the place of what was taken away. You may
guess, after all these expenses, how very far we must be from being
rich, and how acceptable Mrs. Ferrars’s kindness is."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; "and assisted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) liberality, I hope you
may yet live to be in easy circumstances."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Another year or two may do much towards it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) gravely replied; "but
however there is still a great deal to be done. There is not a stone
laid of Fanny’s green-house, and nothing but the plan of the
flower-garden marked out."

<p/>"Where is the green-house to be?"

<p/>"Upon the knoll behind the house. The old walnut trees are all come
down to make room for it. It will be a very fine object from many parts
of the park, and the flower-garden will slope down just before it, and
be exceedingly pretty. We have cleared away all the old thorns that
grew in patches over the brow."

<p/>Elinor kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) censure to herself; and was very
thankful that Marianne was not present, to share the provocation.

<p/>Having now said enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) poverty clear, and to do away the
necessity of buying a pair of ear-rings for each of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sisters, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
next visit at Gray’s, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts took a cheerfuller turn, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
began to congratulate Elinor on having such a friend as Mrs. Jennings.

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) seems a most valuable woman indeed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) style of
living, all bespeak an exceeding good income; and it is an acquaintance
that has not only been of great use to you hitherto, but in the end may
prove materially advantageous. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) inviting you to town is certainly a
vast thing in your favour; and indeed, it speaks altogether so great a
regard for you, that in all probability when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) dies you will not be
forgotten. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) must have a great deal to leave."

<p/>"Nothing at all, I should rather suppose; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) has only her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
jointure, which will descend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) children."

<p/>"But it is not to be imagined that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) lives up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) income. Few
people of common prudence will do _that_ and whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
will be able to dispose of."

<p/>"And do you not think it more likely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should leave it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
daughters, than to us?"

<p/>"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) daughters are both exceedingly well married, and therefore I
cannot perceive the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) remembering them farther. Whereas,
in my opinion, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) taking so much notice of you, and treating you in
this kind of way, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) has given you a sort of claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) future
consideration, which a conscientious woman would not disregard. Nothing
can be kinder than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) behaviour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) can hardly do all this,
without being aware of the expectation it raises."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) raises none in those most concerned. Indeed, brother, your
anxiety for our welfare and prosperity carries you too far."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, to be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), seeming to recollect himself, "people have
little, have very little in their power. But, my dear Elinor, what is
the matter with Marianne?—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looks very unwell, has lost her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) colour,
and is grown quite thin. Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ill?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is not well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has had a nervous complaint on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for several
weeks."

<p/>"I am sorry for that. At her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) time of life, any thing of an illness
destroys the bloom for ever! Hers has been a very short one! She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as
handsome a girl last September, as I ever saw; and as likely to attract
the man. There was something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) style of beauty, to please them
particularly. I remember Fanny used to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would marry sooner
and better than you did; not but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exceedingly fond of _you_,
but so it happened to strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will be mistaken, however. I
question whether Marianne _now_, will marry a man worth more than five
or six hundred a-year, at the utmost, and I am very much deceived if
_you_ do not do better. Dorsetshire! I know very little of Dorsetshire;
but, my dear Elinor, I shall be exceedingly glad to know more of it;
and I think I can answer for your having Fanny and myself among the
earliest and best pleased of your visitors."

<p/>Elinor tried very seriously to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) that there was no
likelihood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) marrying Colonel Brandon; but it was an expectation
of too much pleasure to himself to be relinquished, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was really
resolved on seeking an intimacy with that gentleman, and promoting the
marriage by every possible attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had just compunction enough
for having done nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) sisters himself, to be exceedingly
anxious that everybody else should do a great deal; and an offer from
Colonel Brandon, or a legacy from Mrs. Jennings, was the easiest means
of atoning for his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own neglect.

<p/>They were lucky enough to find Lady Middleton at home, and Sir John
came in before their visit ended. Abundance of civilities passed on all
sides. Sir John was ready to like anybody, and though Mr. Dashwood did
not seem to know much about horses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) soon set him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) down as a very
good-natured fellow: while Lady Middleton saw enough of fashion in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
appearance to think his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) acquaintance worth having; and Mr. Dashwood
went away delighted with both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall have a charming account to carry to Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
walked back with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister. "Lady Middleton is really a most elegant
woman! Such a woman as I am sure Fanny will be glad to know. And Mrs.
Jennings too, an exceedingly well-behaved woman, though not so elegant
as her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) daughter. Your sister need not have any scruple even of visiting
_her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_, which, to say the truth, has been a little the case, and very
naturally; for we only knew that Mrs. Jennings was the widow of a man
who had got all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) money in a low way; and Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars were
both strongly prepossessed, that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughters were
such kind of women as Fanny would like to associate with. But now I can
carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a most satisfactory account of both."
