<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had now been rather more than two months in town,
and Marianne’s impatience to be gone increased every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sighed
for the air, the liberty, the quiet of the country; and fancied that if
any place could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ease, Barton must do it. Elinor was hardly
less anxious than herself for their removal, and only so much less bent
on its being effected immediately, as that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was conscious of the
difficulties of so long a journey, which Marianne could not be brought
to acknowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began, however, seriously to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts
towards its accomplishment, and had already mentioned their wishes to
their kind hostess, who resisted them with all the eloquence of her (<font color='blue'><b>hostess</b></font>)
good-will, when a plan was suggested, which, though detaining them from
home yet a few weeks longer, appeared to Elinor altogether much more
eligible than any other. The Palmers were to remove to Cleveland about
the end of March, for the Easter holidays; and Mrs. Jennings, with both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) friends, received a very warm invitation from Charlotte to go with
them. This would not, in itself, have been sufficient for the delicacy
of Miss Dashwood;—but it was inforced with so much real politeness by
Mr. Palmer himself, as, joined to the very great amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
manners towards them since her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister had been known to be unhappy,
induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to accept it with pleasure.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) told Marianne what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had done, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first reply was
not very auspicious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Cleveland!" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) cried, with great agitation. <div class="bookquote">"No, I cannot go to
Cleveland."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"You forget,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor gently, "that its situation is not—that it is
not in the neighbourhood of—"

<p/>"But it is in Somersetshire.—I cannot go into Somersetshire.—There,
where I looked forward to going...No, Elinor, you cannot expect me to
go there."

<p/>Elinor would not argue upon the propriety of overcoming such
feelings;—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only endeavoured to counteract them by working on
others;—represented it, therefore, as a measure which would fix the
time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returning to that dear mother, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so much wished to
see, in a more eligible, more comfortable manner, than any other plan
could do, and perhaps without any greater delay. From Cleveland, which
was within a few miles of Bristol, the distance to Barton was not
beyond one day, though a long day’s journey; and their mother’s servant
might easily come there to attend them down; and as there could be no
occasion of their staying above a week at Cleveland, they might now be
at home in little more than three weeks’ time. As Marianne’s affection
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was sincere, it must triumph with little difficulty,
over the imaginary evils she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had started.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings was so far from being weary of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) guests, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
pressed them very earnestly to return with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) again from Cleveland.
Elinor was grateful for the attention, but it could not alter her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
design; and their mother’s concurrence being readily gained, every
thing relative to their return was arranged as far as it could be;—and
Marianne found some relief in drawing up a statement of the hours that
were yet to divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from Barton.

<p/>"Ah! Colonel, I do not know what you and I shall do without the Miss
Dashwoods;"—was Mrs. Jennings’s address to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) first called on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), after their leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was settled—"for they are quite resolved
upon going home from the Palmers;—and how forlorn we shall be, when I
come back!—Lord! we shall sit and gape at one another as dull as two
cats."

<p/>Perhaps Mrs. Jennings was in hopes, by this vigorous sketch of their
future ennui, to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) to make that offer, which might give
himself an escape from it; and if so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had soon afterwards good
reason to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) object gained; for, on Elinor’s moving to the
window to take more expeditiously the dimensions of a print, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was going to copy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to it with a look of
particular meaning, and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there for several minutes.
The effect of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) discourse on the lady too, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
observation, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was too honorable to listen, and had even
changed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) seat, on purpose that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might _not_ hear, to one close by
the piano forte on which Marianne was playing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not keep
herself from seeing that Elinor changed colour, attended with
agitation, and was too intent on what he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) employment.
Still farther in confirmation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes, in the interval of
Marianne’s turning from one lesson to another, some words of the
Colonel’s inevitably reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ear, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed to be
apologising for the badness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) house. This set the matter beyond a
doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wondered, indeed, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinking it necessary to do so; but
supposed it to be the proper etiquette. What Elinor said in reply she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not distinguish, but judged from the motion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
did not think _that_ any material objection; and Mrs. Jennings
commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart for being so honest. They then talked on for
a few minutes longer without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) catching a syllable, when another
lucky stop in Marianne’s performance brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) these words in the
Colonel’s calm voice,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."

 (<font color='red'><b>the Colonel</b></font>)</div><p/>Astonished and shocked at so unlover-like a speech, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was almost
ready to cry out, "Lord! what should hinder it?<div class="bookquote">"—but checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
desire, confined herself to this silent ejaculation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This is very strange!—sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) need not wait to be older."

<p/>This delay on the Colonel’s side, however, did not seem to offend or
mortify his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fair companion in the least, for on their breaking up the
conference soon afterwards, and moving different ways, Mrs. Jennings
very plainly heard Elinor say, and with a voice which showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to
feel what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said,

<p/>"I shall always think myself very much obliged to you."

<p/>Mrs. Jennings was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) gratitude, and only wondered that
after hearing such a sentence, the Colonel should be able to take leave
of them, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) immediately did, with the utmost _sang-froid_, and go
away without making her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) any reply! She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) old friend
could have made so indifferent a suitor.

<p/>What had really passed between them was to this effect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have heard,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), with great compassion, "of the injustice your
friend Mr. Ferrars has suffered from his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) family; for if I understand
the matter right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has been entirely cast off by them for persevering
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) engagement with a very deserving young woman. Have I been
rightly informed? Is it so?;<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor told him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) that it was.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>The cruelty, the impolitic cruelty," he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) replied, with great feeling,
"of dividing, or attempting to divide, two young people long attached
to each other, is terrible. Mrs. Ferrars does not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) may be
doing—what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) may drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) son to. I have seen Mr. Ferrars two or
three times in Harley Street, and am much pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is not a
young man with whom one can be intimately acquainted in a short time,
but I have seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) well for his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) own sake, and as
a friend of yours, I wish it still more. I understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) intends
to take orders. Will you be so good as to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) that the living of
Delaford, now just vacant, as I am informed by this day’s post, is his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>),
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) think it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) acceptance; but _that_, perhaps, so
unfortunately circumstanced as he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) is now, it may be nonsense to appear
to doubt; I only wish it were more valuable. It is a rectory, but a
small one; the late incumbent, I believe, did not make more than 200£
per annum, and though it is certainly capable of improvement, I fear,
not to such an amount as to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) a very comfortable income. Such
as it is, however, my pleasure in presenting it to him (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>), will be very
great. Pray assure him (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) of it."

<p/>Elinor’s astonishment at this commission could hardly have been
greater, had the Colonel been really making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) an offer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hand.
The preferment, which only two days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had considered as
hopeless for Edward, was already provided to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to marry; and
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_, of all people in the world, was fixed on to bestow it! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
emotion was such as Mrs. Jennings had attributed to a very different
cause; but whatever minor feelings less pure, less pleasing, might have
a share in that emotion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) esteem for the general benevolence, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) gratitude for the particular friendship, which together prompted
Colonel Brandon to this act, were strongly felt, and warmly expressed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) for it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart, spoke of Edward’s principles
and disposition with that praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew them to deserve; and
promised to undertake the commission with pleasure, if it were really
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wish to put off so agreeable an office to another. But at the same
time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not help thinking that no one could so well perform it
as himself. It was an office in short, from which, unwilling to give
Edward the pain of receiving an obligation from _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would have
been very glad to be spared herself; but Colonel Brandon, on motives of
equal delicacy, declining it likewise, still seemed so desirous of its
being given through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) means, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would not on any account make
farther opposition. Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) believed, was still in town, and
fortunately she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address from Miss Steele. She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could
undertake therefore to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of it, in the course of the day.
After this had been settled, Colonel Brandon began to talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own
advantage in securing so respectable and agreeable a neighbour, and
_then_ it was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mentioned with regret, that the house was small
and indifferent; an evil which Elinor, as Mrs. Jennings had supposed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to do, made very light of, at least as far as regarded its size.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The smallness of the house,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I cannot imagine any
inconvenience to them, for it will be in proportion to their family and
income."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>By which the Colonel was surprised to find that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ was considering
Mr. Ferrars’s marriage as the certain consequence of the presentation;
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not suppose it possible that Delaford living could supply
such an income, as anybody in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) style of life would venture to settle
on, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) said so.

<p/>"This little rectory _can_ do no more than make Mr. Ferrars comfortable
as a bachelor; it cannot enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to marry. I am sorry to say that my
patronage ends with this; and my interest is hardly more extensive. If,
however, by an unforeseen chance it should be in my power to serve him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
farther, I must think very differently of him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from what I now do, if I
am not as ready to be useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) then as I sincerely wish I could be
at present. What I am now doing indeed, seems nothing at all, since it
can advance him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) so little towards what must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) principal, his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) only
object of happiness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) marriage must still be a distant good; at
least, I am afraid it cannot take place very soon."

<p/>Such was the sentence which, when misunderstood, so justly offended the
delicate feelings of Mrs. Jennings; but after this narration of what
really passed between Colonel Brandon and Elinor, while they stood at
the window, the gratitude expressed by the latter on their parting, may
perhaps appear in general, not less reasonably excited, nor less
properly worded than if it had arisen from an offer of marriage.
