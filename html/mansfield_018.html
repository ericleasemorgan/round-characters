<p/>Everything was now in a regular train: theatre, actors, actresses, and
dresses, were all getting forward; but though no other great
impediments arose, Fanny found, before many days were past, that it was
not all uninterrupted enjoyment to the party themselves, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had not to witness the continuance of such unanimity and delight as had
been almost too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at first. Everybody began to have their
vexation. Edmund had many. Entirely against _his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ judgment, a
scene-painter arrived from town, and was at work, much to the increase
of the expenses, and, what was worse, of the eclat of their
proceedings; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother, instead of being really guided by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as
to the privacy of the representation, was giving an invitation to every
family who came in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) way. Tom himself began to fret over the
scene-painter’s slow progress, and to feel the miseries of waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
had learned his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) part—all his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) parts, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) took every trifling one that
could be united with the Butler, and began to be impatient to be
acting; and every day thus unemployed was tending to increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) sense
of the insignificance of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) parts together, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) more
ready to regret that some other play had not been chosen.

<p/>Fanny, being always a very courteous listener, and often the only
listener at hand, came in for the complaints and the distresses of most
of them. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ knew that Mr. Yates was in general thought to rant
dreadfully; that Mr. Yates was disappointed in Henry Crawford; that Tom
Bertram spoke so quick he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would be unintelligible; that Mrs. Grant
spoiled everything by laughing; that Edmund was behindhand with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
part, and that it was misery to have anything to do with Mr. Rushworth,
who was wanting a prompter through every speech. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) knew, also, that
poor Mr. Rushworth could seldom get anybody to rehearse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>): _his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_
complaint came before her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) as well as the rest; and so decided to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
eye was her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) cousin Maria’s avoidance of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and so needlessly often
the rehearsal of the first scene between her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and Mr. Crawford, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had soon all the terror of other complaints from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_. So far from
being all satisfied and all enjoying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found everybody requiring
something they had not, and giving occasion of discontent to the
others. Everybody had a part either too long or too short; nobody would
attend as they ought; nobody would remember on which side they were to
come in; nobody but the complainer would observe any directions.

<p/>Fanny believed herself to derive as much innocent enjoyment from the
play as any of them; Henry Crawford acted well, and it was a pleasure
to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ to creep into the theatre, and attend the rehearsal of the
first act, in spite of the feelings it excited in some speeches for
Maria. Maria, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) also thought, acted well, too well; and after the
first rehearsal or two, Fanny began to be their only audience; and
sometimes as prompter, sometimes as spectator, was often very useful.
As far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could judge, Mr. Crawford was considerably the best actor
of all: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had more confidence than Edmund, more judgment than Tom,
more talent and taste than Mr. Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) as a man,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) to be the best actor, and on this point there
were not many who differed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Mr. Yates, indeed, exclaimed
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) tameness and insipidity; and the day came at last, when Mr.
Rushworth turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with a black look, and said, "Do you think
there is anything so very fine in all this? For the life and soul of
me, I cannot admire him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); and, between ourselves, to see such an
undersized, little, mean-looking man, set up for a fine actor, is very
ridiculous in my opinion."

<p/>From this moment there was a return of his (<font color='blue'><b>actor</b></font>) former jealousy, which
Maria, from increasing hopes of Crawford, was at little pains to
remove; and the chances of Mr. Rushworth’s ever attaining to the
knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) two-and-forty speeches became much less. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
ever making anything _tolerable_ of them, nobody had the smallest idea
of that except his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother; _she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)_, indeed, regretted that his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) part was
not more considerable, and deferred coming over to Mansfield till they
were forward enough in their rehearsal to comprehend all his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) scenes;
but the others aspired at nothing beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) remembering the catchword,
and the first line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) speech, and being able to follow the prompter
through the rest. Fanny, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pity and kindheartedness, was at great
pains to teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) how to learn, giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) all the helps and
directions in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) power, trying to make an artificial memory for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>),
and learning every word of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) part herself, but without his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) being much
the forwarder.

<p/>Many uncomfortable, anxious, apprehensive feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly had;
but with all these, and other claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time and attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
as far from finding herself without employment or utility amongst them,
as without a companion in uneasiness; quite as far from having no
demand on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leisure as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) compassion. The gloom of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first
anticipations was proved to have been unfounded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was occasionally
useful to all; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was perhaps as much at peace as any.

<p/>There was a great deal of needlework to be done, moreover, in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
help was wanted; and that Mrs. Norris thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) quite as well off as
the rest, was evident by the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) claimed it—<div class="bookquote">"Come,
Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, "these are fine times for you, but you must not be
always walking from one room to the other, and doing the lookings-on at
your ease, in this way; I want you here. I have been slaving myself
till I can hardly stand, to contrive Mr. Rushworth’s cloak without
sending for any more satin; and now I think you may give me your help
in putting it together. There are but three seams; you may do them in a
trice. It would be lucky for me if I had nothing but the executive part
to do. _You_ are best off, I can tell you: but if nobody did more than
_you_, we should not get on very fast."

<p/>Fanny took the work very quietly, without attempting any defence; but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kinder aunt Bertram observed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) behalf—

<p/>"One cannot wonder, sister, that Fanny _should_ be delighted: it is all
new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), you know; you and I used to be very fond of a play
ourselves, and so am I still; and as soon as I am a little more at
leisure, _I_ mean to look in at their rehearsals too. What is the play
about, Fanny? you have never told me."

<p/>"Oh! sister, pray do not ask her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) now; for Fanny is not one of those who
can talk and work at the same time. It is about Lovers’ Vows."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I believe,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, "there will be three acts
rehearsed to-morrow evening, and that will give you an opportunity of
seeing all the actors at once."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You had better stay till the curtain is hung,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>interposed Mrs. Norris;
"the curtain will be hung in a day or two—there is very little sense in
a play without a curtain—and I am much mistaken if you do not find it
draw up into very handsome festoons."

<p/>Lady Bertram seemed quite resigned to waiting. Fanny did not share her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt’s composure: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of the morrow a great deal, for if the
three acts were rehearsed, Edmund and Miss Crawford would then be
acting together for the first time; the third act would bring a scene
between them which interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) most particularly, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
longing and dreading to see how they would perform. The whole subject
of it was love—a marriage of love was to be described by the gentleman,
and very little short of a declaration of love be made by the lady.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had read and read the scene again with many painful, many wondering
emotions, and looked forward to their representation of it as a
circumstance almost too interesting. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did not _believe_ they had yet
rehearsed it, even in private.

<p/>The morrow came, the plan for the evening continued, and Fanny’s
consideration of it did not become less agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worked very
diligently under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s directions, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) diligence and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
silence concealed a very absent, anxious mind; and about noon she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) escape with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work to the East room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have no
concern in another, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deemed it, most unnecessary rehearsal
of the first act, which Henry Crawford was just proposing, desirous at
once of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time to herself, and of avoiding the sight of Mr.
Rushworth. A glimpse, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed through the hall, of the two ladies
walking up from the Parsonage made no change in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wish of retreat,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worked and meditated in the East room, undisturbed, for a
quarter of an hour, when a gentle tap at the door was followed by the
entrance of Miss Crawford.

<p/>"Am I right? Yes; this is the East room. My dear Miss Price, I beg your
pardon, but I have made my way to you on purpose to entreat your help.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny, quite surprised, endeavoured to shew herself mistress of the
room by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) civilities, and looked at the bright bars of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) empty
grate with concern.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Thank you; I am quite warm, very warm. Allow me to stay here a little
while, and do have the goodness to hear me my third act. I have brought
my book, and if you would but rehearse it with me, I should be _so_
obliged! I came here to-day intending to rehearse it with Edmund—by
ourselves—against the evening, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is not in the way; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
_were_, I do not think I could go through it with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_, till I have
hardened myself a little; for really there is a speech or two. You will
be so good, won’t you?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny was most civil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) assurances, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not give them
in a very steady voice.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Have you ever happened to look at the part I mean?<div class="bookquote">" continued Miss
Crawford, opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) book. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Here it is. I did not think much of it at
first—but, upon my word. There, look at _that_ speech, and _that_, and
_that_. How am I ever to look him (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the face and say such things?
Could you do it? But then he (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is your cousin, which makes all the
difference. You must rehearse it with me, that I may fancy _you_ him (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and get on by degrees. You _have_ a look of _his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ sometimes."

<p/>"Have I? I will do my best with the greatest readiness; but I must
_read_ the part, for I can say very little of it."

<p/>"_None_ of it, I suppose. You are to have the book, of course. Now for
it. We must have two chairs at hand for you to bring forward to the
front of the stage. There—very good school-room chairs, not made for a
theatre, I dare say; much more fitted for little girls to sit and kick
their feet against when they are learning a lesson. What would your
governess and your uncle say to see them used for such a purpose? Could
Sir Thomas look in upon us just now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would bless himself, for we are
rehearsing all over the house. Yates is storming away in the
dining-room. I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) as I came upstairs, and the theatre is engaged
of course by those indefatigable rehearsers, Agatha and Frederick. If
_they_ are not perfect, I _shall_ be surprised. By the bye, I looked in
upon them five minutes ago, and it happened to be exactly at one of the
times when they were trying _not_ to embrace, and Mr. Rushworth was
with me. I thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) began to look a little queer, so I turned it off
as well as I could, by whispering to him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘We shall have an excellent
Agatha; there is something so _maternal_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) manner, so completely
_maternal_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) voice and countenance.’  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Was not that well done of me?
He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) brightened up directly. Now for my soliloquy."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) began, and Fanny joined in with all the modest feeling which the
idea of representing Edmund was so strongly calculated to inspire; but
with looks and voice so truly feminine as to be no very good picture of
a man. With such an Anhalt, however, Miss Crawford had courage enough;
and they had got through half the scene, when a tap at the door brought
a pause, and the entrance of Edmund, the next moment, suspended it all.

<p/>Surprise, consciousness, and pleasure appeared in each of the three on
this unexpected meeting; and as Edmund was come on the very same
business that had brought Miss Crawford, consciousness and pleasure
were likely to be more than momentary in _them_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) book,
and was seeking Fanny, to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to rehearse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to
prepare for the evening, without knowing Miss Crawford to be in the
house; and great was the joy and animation of being thus thrown
together, of comparing schemes, and sympathising in praise of Fanny’s
kind offices.

<p/>_She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ could not equal them in their warmth. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ spirits sank under
the glow of theirs, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt herself becoming too nearly nothing to
both to have any comfort in having been sought by either. They must now
rehearse together. Edmund proposed, urged, entreated it, till the lady,
not very unwilling at first, could refuse no longer, and Fanny was
wanted only to prompt and observe them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was invested, indeed, with
the office of judge and critic, and earnestly desired to exercise it
and tell them all their faults; but from doing so every feeling within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shrank—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not, would not, dared not attempt it: had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been
otherwise qualified for criticism, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conscience must have restrained
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from venturing at disapprobation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed herself to feel too
much of it in the aggregate for honesty or safety in particulars. To
prompt them must be enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and it was sometimes _more_ than
enough; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not always pay attention to the book. In watching
them she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forgot herself; and, agitated by the increasing spirit of
Edmund’s manner, had once closed the page and turned away exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
wanted help. It was imputed to very reasonable weariness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
thanked and pitied; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) deserved their pity more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped
they would ever surmise. At last the scene was over, and Fanny forced
herself to add her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise to the compliments each was giving the other;
and when again alone and able to recall the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was inclined to
believe their performance would, indeed, have such nature and feeling
in it as must ensure their credit, and make it a very suffering
exhibition to herself. Whatever might be its effect, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must
stand the brunt of it again that very day.

<p/>The first regular rehearsal of the three first acts was certainly to
take place in the evening: Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords were engaged to
return for that purpose as soon as they could after dinner; and every
one concerned was looking forward with eagerness. There seemed a
general diffusion of cheerfulness on the occasion. Tom was enjoying
such an advance towards the end; Edmund was in spirits from the
morning’s rehearsal, and little vexations seemed everywhere smoothed
away. All were alert and impatient; the ladies moved soon, the
gentlemen soon followed them, and with the exception of Lady Bertram,
Mrs. Norris, and Julia, everybody was in the theatre at an early hour;
and having lighted it up as well as its unfinished state admitted, were
waiting only the arrival of Mrs. Grant and the Crawfords to begin.

<p/>They did not wait long for the Crawfords, but there was no Mrs. Grant.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not come. Dr. Grant, professing an indisposition, for which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had little credit with his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fair sister-in-law, could not spare his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dr. Grant is ill,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), with mock solemnity. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) has been ill
ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did not eat any of the pheasant today. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fancied it
tough, sent away his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) plate, and has been suffering ever since" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>Here was disappointment! Mrs. Grant’s non-attendance was sad indeed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) pleasant manners and cheerful conformity made her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) always valuable
amongst them; but _now_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was absolutely necessary. They could not
act, they could not rehearse with any satisfaction without her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>). The
comfort of the whole evening was destroyed. What was to be done? Tom,
as Cottager, was in despair. After a pause of perplexity, some eyes
began to be turned towards Fanny, and a voice or two to say, <div class="bookquote">"If Miss
Price would be so good as to _read_ the part."  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was immediately
surrounded by supplications; everybody asked it; even Edmund said, <div class="bookquote">"Do,
Fanny, if it is not _very_ disagreeable to you."

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div><p/>But Fanny still hung back. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not endure the idea of it. Why was
not Miss Crawford to be applied to as well? Or why had not she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) rather
gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own room, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had felt to be safest, instead of
attending the rehearsal at all? She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had known it would irritate and
distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had known it her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) duty to keep away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was properly
punished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have only to _read_ the part,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford, with renewed
entreaty.

<p/>"And I do believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) can say every word of it,<div class="bookquote">" added Maria, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>for she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
could put Mrs. Grant right the other day in twenty places. Fanny, I am
sure you know the part."

<p/>Fanny could not say she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did _not_; and as they all persevered, as
Edmund repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) wish, and with a look of even fond dependence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good-nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must yield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) best. Everybody was
satisfied; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was left to the tremors of a most palpitating heart,
while the others prepared to begin.

<p/>They _did_ begin; and being too much engaged in their own noise to be
struck by an unusual noise in the other part of the house, had
proceeded some way when the door of the room was thrown open, and
Julia, appearing at it, with a face all aghast, exclaimed, "My father
is come! He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is in the hall at this moment."
