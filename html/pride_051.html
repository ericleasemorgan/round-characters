<p/>Their sister’s wedding day arrived; and Jane and Elizabeth felt
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) probably more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt for herself. The carriage was
sent to meet them at ——, and they were to return in it by
dinner-time. Their arrival was dreaded by the elder Miss Bennets,
and Jane more especially, who gave Lydia the feelings which would
have attended herself, had _she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ been the culprit, and was
wretched in the thought of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister must endure.

<p/>They came. The family were assembled in the breakfast room to
receive them. Smiles decked the face of Mrs. Bennet as the
carriage drove up to the door; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband looked impenetrably
grave; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters, alarmed, anxious, uneasy.

<p/>Lydia’s voice was heard in the vestibule; the door was thrown
open, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ran into the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother stepped forwards,
embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), and welcomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) with rapture; gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hand, with
an affectionate smile, to Wickham, who followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) lady; and
wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of
their happiness.

<p/>Their reception from Mr. Bennet, to whom they then turned, was
not quite so cordial. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) countenance rather gained in austerity;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) scarcely opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lips. The easy assurance of the young
couple, indeed, was enough to provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Elizabeth was
disgusted, and even Miss Bennet was shocked. Lydia was Lydia
still; untamed, unabashed, wild, noisy, and fearless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) turned
from sister to sister, demanding their congratulations; and when
at length they all sat down, looked eagerly round the room, took
notice of some little alteration in it, and observed, with a
laugh, that it was a great while since she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been there.

<p/>Wickham was not at all more distressed than herself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
manners were always so pleasing, that had his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) character and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
marriage been exactly what they ought, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) smiles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) easy
address, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) claimed their relationship, would have
delighted them all. Elizabeth had not before believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) quite
equal to such assurance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down, resolving within
herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an
impudent man. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ blushed, and Jane blushed; but the cheeks of
the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of
colour.

<p/>There was no want of discourse. The bride and her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother could
neither of them talk fast enough; and Wickham, who happened to
sit near Elizabeth, began enquiring after his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) acquaintance in
that neighbourhood, with a good humoured ease which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt very
unable to equal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replies. They seemed each of them to have
the happiest memories in the world. Nothing of the past was
recollected with pain; and Lydia led voluntarily to subjects
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters would not have alluded to for the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Only think of its being three months,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried, "since I went
away; it seems but a fortnight I declare; and yet there have been
things enough happened in the time. Good gracious! when I went
away, I am sure I had no more idea of being married till I came
back again! though I thought it would be very good fun if I was."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father lifted up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes. Jane was distressed. Elizabeth
looked expressively at Lydia; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), who never heard nor saw
anything of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chose to be insensible, gaily continued,
"Oh! mamma, do the people hereabouts know I am married to-day? I
was afraid they might not; and we overtook William Goulding in
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) curricle, so I was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should know it, and so I let
down the side-glass next to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and took off my glove, and let
my hand just rest upon the window frame, so that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might see the
ring, and then I bowed and smiled like anything.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could bear it no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) got up, and ran out of the
room; and returned no more, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard them passing through
the hall to the dining parlour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then joined them soon enough
to see Lydia, with anxious parade, walk up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother’s right
hand, and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eldest sister, " (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>Ah! Jane, I take
your place now, and you must go lower, because I am a married
woman."

<p/>It was not to be supposed that time would give Lydia that
embarrassment from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been so wholly free at first.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ease and good spirits increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) longed to see Mrs.
Phillips, the Lucases, and all their other neighbours, and to
hear herself called <div class="bookquote">"Mrs. Wickham"  (<font color='red'><b>all neighbours</b></font>)</div>by each of them; and in the
mean time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) went after dinner to show her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ring, and boast of
being married, to Mrs. Hill and the two housemaids.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, mamma,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), when they were all returned to the
breakfast room, "and what do you think of my husband? Is not he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) a
charming man? I am sure my sisters must all envy me. I only hope
they may have half my good luck. They must all go to Brighton.
That is the place to get husbands. What a pity it is, mamma, we
did not all go."

<p/>"Very true; and if I had my will, we should. But my dear Lydia, I
don’t at all like your going such a way off. Must it be so?"

<p/>"Oh, lord! yes;—there is nothing in that. I shall like it of all
things. You and papa, and my sisters, must come down and see us.
We shall be at Newcastle all the winter, and I dare say there
will be some balls, and I will take care to get good partners for
them all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should like it beyond anything!"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother.

<p/>"And then when you go away, you may leave one or two of my
sisters behind you; and I dare say I shall get husbands for them
before the winter is over."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I thank you for my share of the favour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; "but I
do not particularly like your way of getting husbands."

<p/>Their visitors were not to remain above ten days with them. Mr.
Wickham had received his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) commission before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) left London, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
was to join his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regiment at the end of a fortnight.

<p/>No one but Mrs. Bennet regretted that their stay would be so
short; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) made the most of the time by visiting about with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and having very frequent parties at home. These
parties were acceptable to all; to avoid a family circle was even
more desirable to such as did think, than such as did not.

<p/>Wickham’s affection for Lydia was just what Elizabeth had
expected to find it; not equal to Lydia’s for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had
scarcely needed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) present observation to be satisfied, from the
reason of things, that their elopement had been brought on by the
strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) love, rather than by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would have
wondered why, without violently caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) chose to elope
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) at all, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) not felt certain that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) flight was
rendered necessary by distress of circumstances; and if that were
the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not the young man to resist an opportunity of
having a companion.

<p/>Lydia was exceedingly fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) dear Wickham on
every occasion; no one was to be put in competition with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
did every thing best in the world; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would kill
more birds on the first of September, than any body else in the
country.

<p/>One morning, soon after their arrival, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sitting with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) two elder sisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) said to Elizabeth:

<p/>"Lizzy, I never gave _you_ an account of my wedding, I believe.
You were not by, when I told mamma and the others all about it.
Are not you curious to hear how it was managed?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No really,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth; "I think there cannot be too
little said on the subject."

<p/>"La! You are so strange! But I must tell you how it went off. We
were married, you know, at St. Clement’s, because Wickham’s
lodgings were in that parish. And it was settled that we should
all be there by eleven o’clock. My uncle and aunt and I were to
go together; and the others were to meet us at the church. Well,
Monday morning came, and I was in such a fuss! I was so afraid,
you know, that something would happen to put it off, and then I
should have gone quite distracted. And there was my aunt, all the
time I was dressing, preaching and talking away just as if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
was reading a sermon. However, I did not hear above one word in
ten, for I was thinking, you may suppose, of my dear Wickham. I
longed to know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would be married in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) blue coat."

<p/>"Well, and so we breakfasted at ten as usual; I thought it would
never be over; for, by the bye, you are to understand, that my
uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time I was with
them. If you’ll believe me, I did not once put my foot out of
doors, though I was there a fortnight. Not one party, or scheme,
or anything. To be sure London was rather thin, but, however, the
Little Theatre was open. Well, and so just as the carriage came
to the door, my uncle was called away upon business to that
horrid man Mr. Stone. And then, you know, when once they get
together, there is no end of it. Well, I was so frightened I did
not know what to do, for my uncle was to give me away; and if we
were beyond the hour, we could not be married all day. But,
luckily, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) came back again in ten minutes’ time, and then we all
set out. However, I recollected afterwards that if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) _had_ been
prevented going, the wedding need not be put off, for Mr. Darcy
might have done as well.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darcy!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Elizabeth, in utter amazement.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, yes!—he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was to come there with Wickham, you know. But
gracious me! I quite forgot! I ought not to have said a word
about it. I promised them so faithfully! What will Wickham say?
It was to be such a secret!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If it was to be secret,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, "say not another word on the
subject. You may depend upon my seeking no further."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, though burning with curiosity;
"we will ask you no questions."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Thank you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, "for if you did, I should certainly tell
you all, and then Wickham would be angry."

<p/>On such encouragement to ask, Elizabeth was forced to put it out
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power, by running away.

<p/>But to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible; or at
least it was impossible not to try for information. Mr. Darcy had
been at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s wedding. It was exactly a scene, and exactly
among people, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had apparently least to do, and least
temptation to go. Conjectures as to the meaning of it, rapid and
wild, hurried into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brain; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was satisfied with none.
Those that best pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) conduct in the
noblest light, seemed most improbable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not bear such
suspense; and hastily seizing a sheet of paper, wrote a short
letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, to request an explanation of what Lydia had
dropt, if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been
intended.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may readily comprehend,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, "what my curiosity must
be to know how a person unconnected with any of us, and
(comparatively speaking) a stranger to our family, should have
been amongst you at such a time. Pray write instantly, and let me
understand it—unless it is, for very cogent reasons, to remain in
the secrecy which Lydia seems to think necessary; and then I must
endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not that I _shall_, though,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added to herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
finished the letter; "and my dear aunt, if you do not tell me in
an honourable manner, I shall certainly be reduced to tricks and
stratagems to find it out."

<p/>Jane’s delicate sense of honour would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to speak to
Elizabeth privately of what Lydia had let fall; Elizabeth was
glad of it;—till it appeared whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) enquiries would receive
any satisfaction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had rather be without a confidante.
