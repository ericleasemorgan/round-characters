<p/>The weather continued much the same all the following morning; and the same loneliness, and the same melancholy, seemed to reign at Hartfield but in the afternoon it cleared; the wind changed into a softer quarter; the clouds were carried off; the sun appeared; it was summer again. With all the eagerness which such a transition gives, Emma resolved to be out of doors as soon as possible. Never had the exquisite sight, smell, sensation of nature, tranquil, warm, and brilliant after a storm, been more attractive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) longed for the serenity they might gradually introduce; and on Mr. Perry's coming in soon after dinner, with a disengaged hour to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost no time in hurrying into the shrubbery. There, with spirits freshened, and thoughts a little relieved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had taken a few turns, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Mr. Knightley passing through the garden door, and coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It was the first intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being returned from London. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) the moment before, as unquestionably sixteen miles distant. There was time only for the quickest arrangement of mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be collected and calm. In half a minute they were together. The "How d'ye do's" were quiet and constrained on each side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked after their mutual friends; they were all well. When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left them? Only that morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have had a wet ride. Yes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) meant to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had just looked into the dining-room, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not wanted there, preferred being out of doors."  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) neither looked nor spoke cheerfully; and the first possible cause for it, suggested by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fears, was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had perhaps been communicating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) plans to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, and was pained by the manner in which they had been received.

<p/>They walked together. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was often looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and trying for a fuller view of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face than it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to give. And this belief produced another dread. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might be watching for encouragement to begin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not, could not, feel equal to lead the way to any such subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must do it all himself. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not bear this silence. With him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) it was most unnatural. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered resolved and, trying to smile, began

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have some news to hear, now you are come back, that will rather surprize you."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Have I?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) quietly, and looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); "of what nature?"

<p/>"Oh! the best nature in the world a wedding."

<p/>After waiting a moment, as if to be sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) intended to say no more, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied,

<p/>"If you mean Miss Fairfax and Frank Churchill, I have heard that already."

<p/>"How is it possible?<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glowing cheeks towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); for, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke, it occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might have called at Mrs. Goddard's in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) way.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had a few lines on parish business from Mr. Weston this morning, and at the end of them he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave me a brief account of what had happened.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma was quite relieved, and could presently say, with a little more composure,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You probably have been less surprized than any of us, for you have had your suspicions. I have not forgotten that you once tried to give me a caution. I wish I had attended to it but (with a sinking voice and a heavy sigh) I seem to have been doomed to blindness.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>For a moment or two nothing was said, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was unsuspicious of having excited any particular interest, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm drawn within his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), and pressed against his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) heart, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) thus saying, in a tone of great sensibility, speaking low,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>dearest</b></font>)</div>Time, my dearest Emma, time will heal the wound. Your own excellent sense your exertions for your father's sake I know you will not allow yourself .<div class="bookquote">" Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arm was pressed again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) added, in a more broken and subdued accent, " (<font color='red'><b>scoundrel</b></font>)</div>The feelings of the warmest friendship Indignation Abominable scoundrel!" And in a louder, steadier tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) concluded with, "He (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>) will soon be gone. They will soon be in Yorkshire. I am sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) deserves a better fate."

<p/>Emma understood him (<font color='blue'><b>scoundrel</b></font>); and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could recover from the flutter of pleasure, excited by such tender consideration, replied,

<p/>"You are very kind but you are mistaken and I must set you right.  I am not in want of that sort of compassion. My blindness to what was going on, led me to act by them in a way that I must always be ashamed of, and I was very foolishly tempted to say and do many things which may well lay me open to unpleasant conjectures, but I have no other reason to regret that I was not in the secret earlier."

<p/>"Emma!" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), looking eagerly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "are you, indeed?" but checking himself "No, no, I understand you forgive me I am pleased that you can say even so much. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is no object of regret, indeed! and it will not be very long, I hope, before that becomes the acknowledgment of more than your reason. Fortunate that your affections were not farther entangled! I could never, I confess, from your manners, assure myself as to the degree of what you felt I could only be certain that there was a preference and a preference which I never believed him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to deserve. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) is a disgrace to the name of man. And is he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to be rewarded with that sweet young woman? Jane, Jane, you will be a miserable creature.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley," said Emma, trying to be lively, but really confused "I am in a very extraordinary situation. I cannot let you continue in your error; and yet, perhaps, since my manners gave such an impression, I have as much reason to be ashamed of confessing that I never have been at all attached to the person we are speaking of, as it might be natural for a woman to feel in confessing exactly the reverse. But I never have."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) listened in perfect silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must say more before she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were entitled to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) clemency; but it was a hard case to be obliged still to lower herself in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) went on, however.

<p/>"I have very little to say for my own conduct. I was tempted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attentions, and allowed myself to appear pleased. An old story, probably a common case and no more than has happened to hundreds of my sex before; and yet it may not be the more excusable in one who sets up as I do for Understanding. Many circumstances assisted the temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was the son of Mr. Weston he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was continually here I always found him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very pleasant and, in short, for (with a sigh) let me swell out the causes ever so ingeniously, they all centre in this at last my vanity was flattered, and I allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions. Latterly, however for some time, indeed I have had no idea of their meaning any thing. I thought them a habit, a trick, nothing that called for seriousness on my side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has imposed on me, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has not injured me. I have never been attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). And now I can tolerably comprehend his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never wished to attach me. It was merely a blind to conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real situation with another. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) object to blind all about him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and no one, I am sure, could be more effectually blinded than myself except that I was not blinded that it was my good fortune that, in short, I was somehow or other safe from him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had hoped for an answer here for a few words to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) conduct was at least intelligible; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was silent; and, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could judge, deep in thought. At last, and tolerably in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) usual tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said,

<p/>"I have never had a high opinion of Frank Churchill. I can suppose, however, that I may have underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). My acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has been but trifling. And even if I have not underrated him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) hitherto, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) may yet turn out well. With such a woman he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has a chance. I have no motive for wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ill and for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sake, whose happiness will be involved in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) good character and conduct, I shall certainly wish him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) well."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have no doubt of their being happy together,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma; "I believe them to be very mutually and very sincerely attached."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a most fortunate man!<div class="bookquote">" returned Mr. Knightley, with energy. " (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>So early in life at three-and-twenty a period when, if a man chuses a wife, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) generally chuses ill. At three-and-twenty to have drawn such a prize! What years of felicity that man, in all human calculation, has before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)! Assured of the love of such a woman the disinterested love, for Jane Fairfax's character vouches for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) disinterestedness; every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) favour, equality of situation I mean, as far as regards society, and all the habits and manners that are important; equality in every point but one and that one, since the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heart is not to be doubted, such as must increase his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) felicity, for it will be his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to bestow the only advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wants. A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) from; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) who can do it, where there is no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals. Frank Churchill is, indeed, the favourite of fortune. Every thing turns out for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) meets with a young woman at a watering-place, gains her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affection, cannot even weary her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) by negligent treatment and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) family sought round the world for a perfect wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), they could not have found her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) superior. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt is in the way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt dies. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has only to speak. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) friends are eager to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had used every body ill and they are all delighted to forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is a fortunate man indeed!"

<p/>"You speak as if you envied him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)."

<p/>"And I do envy him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), Emma. In one respect he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is the object of my envy."

<p/>Emma could say no more. They seemed to be within half a sentence of Harriet, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) immediate feeling was to avert the subject, if possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) plan; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would speak of something totally different the children in Brunswick Square; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) only waited for breath to begin, when Mr. Knightley startled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), by saying,

<p/>"You will not ask me what is the point of envy. You are determined, I see, to have no curiosity. You are wise but I cannot be wise. Emma, I must tell you what you will not ask, though I may wish it unsaid the next moment."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! then, don't speak it, don't speak it,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eagerly cried. "Take a little time, consider, do not commit yourself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Thank you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>), in an accent of deep mortification, and not another syllable followed.

<p/>Emma could not bear to give him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) pain. He (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) was wishing to confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perhaps to consult her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) what it would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would listen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might assist his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) resolution, or reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) to it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might give just praise to Harriet, or, by representing to him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) own independence, relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) from that state of indecision, which must be more intolerable than any alternative to such a mind as his (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>). They had reached the house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are going in, I suppose?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma quite confirmed by the depressed manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) still spoke "I should like to take another turn. Mr. Perry is not gone." And, after proceeding a few steps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added "I stopped you ungraciously, just now, Mr. Knightley, and, I am afraid, gave you pain. But if you have any wish to speak openly to me as a friend, or to ask my opinion of any thing that you may have in contemplation as a friend, indeed, you may command me. I will hear whatever you like. I will tell you exactly what I think."

<p/>"As a friend!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Mr. Knightley. " (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>Emma, that I fear is a word No, I have no wish Stay, yes, why should I hesitate? I have gone too far already for concealment. Emma, I accept your offer Extraordinary as it may seem, I accept it, and refer myself to you as a friend. Tell me, then, have I no chance of ever succeeding?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) earnestness to look the question, and the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) eyes overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>dearest Emma</b></font>)</div>My dearest Emma," said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), "for dearest you will always be, whatever the event of this hour's conversation, my dearest, most beloved Emma tell me at once. Say <div class="bookquote">'No,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>if it is to be said.<div class="bookquote">" She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could really say nothing. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You are silent," he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) cried, with great animation; "absolutely silent! at present I ask no more."

<p/>Emma was almost ready to sink under the agitation of this moment. The dread of being awakened from the happiest dream, was perhaps the most prominent feeling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot make speeches, Emma:"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) soon resumed; and in a tone of such sincere, decided, intelligible tenderness as was tolerably convincing. "If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me. I have blamed you, and lectured you, and you have borne it as no other woman in England would have borne it. Bear with the truths I would tell you now, dearest Emma, as well as you have borne with them. The manner, perhaps, may have as little to recommend them. God knows, I have been a very indifferent lover. But you understand me. Yes, you see, you understand my feelings and will return them if you can. At present, I ask only to hear, once to hear your voice."

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke, Emma's mind was most busy, and, with all the wonderful velocity of thought, had been able and yet without losing a word to catch and comprehend the exact truth of the whole; to see that Harriet's hopes had been entirely groundless, a mistake, a delusion, as complete a delusion as any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own that Harriet was nothing; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was every thing herself; that what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been saying relative to Harriet had been all taken as the language of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own feelings; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) agitation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doubts, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reluctance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) discouragement, had been all received as discouragement from herself. And not only was there time for these convictions, with all their glow of attendant happiness; there was time also to rejoice that Harriet's secret had not escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and to resolve that it need not, and should not. It was all the service she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now render her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) poor friend; for as to any of that heroism of sentiment which might have prompted her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affection from herself to Harriet, as infinitely the most worthy of the two or even the more simple sublimity of resolving to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) at once and for ever, without vouchsafing any motive, because he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not marry them both, Emma had it not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt for Harriet, with pain and with contrition; but no flight of generosity run mad, opposing all that could be probable or reasonable, entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend astray, and it would be a reproach to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for ever; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) judgment was as strong as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings, and as strong as it had ever been before, in reprobating any such alliance for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), as most unequal and degrading. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way was clear, though not quite smooth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke then, on being so entreated. What did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) say? Just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought, of course. A lady always does. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) said enough to shew there need not be despair and to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to say more himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had despaired at one period; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such an injunction to caution and silence, as for the time crushed every hope; she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had begun by refusing to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). The change had perhaps been somewhat sudden; her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) proposal of taking another turn, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) renewing the conversation which she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had just put an end to, might be a little extraordinary! She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt its inconsistency; but Mr. Knightley was so obliging as to put up with it, and seek no farther explanation.

<p/>Seldom, very seldom, does complete truth belong to any human disclosure; seldom can it happen that something is not a little disguised, or a little mistaken; but where, as in this case, though the conduct is mistaken, the feelings are not, it may not be very material. Mr. Knightley could not impute to Emma a more relenting heart than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) possessed, or a heart more disposed to accept of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, in fact, been wholly unsuspicious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into the shrubbery with no idea of trying it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had come, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bore Frank Churchill's engagement, with no selfish view, no view at all, but of endeavouring, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) an opening, to soothe or to counsel her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The rest had been the work of the moment, the immediate effect of what he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) heard, on his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) feelings. The delightful assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) total indifference towards Frank Churchill, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having a heart completely disengaged from him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), had given birth to the hope, that, in time, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might gain her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection himself; but it had been no present hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had only, in the momentary conquest of eagerness over judgment, aspired to be told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not forbid his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attempt to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The superior hopes which gradually opened were so much the more enchanting. The affection, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been asking to be allowed to create, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could, was already his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)! Within half an hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had passed from a thoroughly distressed state of mind, to something so like perfect happiness, that it could bear no other name.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) change was equal. This one half-hour had given to each the same precious certainty of being beloved, had cleared from each the same degree of ignorance, jealousy, or distrust. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side, there had been a long-standing jealousy, old as the arrival, or even the expectation, of Frank Churchill. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in love with Emma, and jealous of Frank Churchill, from about the same period, one sentiment having probably enlightened him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as to the other. It was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) jealousy of Frank Churchill that had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) from the country. The Box Hill party had decided him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) on going away. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would save himself from witnessing again such permitted, encouraged attentions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had gone to learn to be indifferent. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had gone to a wrong place. There was too much domestic happiness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brother's house; woman wore too amiable a form in it; Isabella was too much like Emma differing only in those striking inferiorities, which always brought the other in brilliancy before him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), for much to have been done, even had his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) time been longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had stayed on, however, vigorously, day after day till this very morning's post had conveyed the history of Jane Fairfax. Then, with the gladness which must be felt, nay, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not scruple to feel, having never believed Frank Churchill to be at all deserving Emma, was there so much fond solicitude, so much keen anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could stay no longer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had ridden home through the rain; and had walked up directly after dinner, to see how this sweetest and best of all creatures, faultless in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) faults, bore the discovery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitated and low. Frank Churchill was a villain.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) declare that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Frank Churchill's character was not desperate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own Emma, by hand and word, when they returned into the house; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could have thought of Frank Churchill then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might have deemed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a very good sort of fellow.
