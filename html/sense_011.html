<p/>Little had Mrs. Dashwood or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters imagined when they first came
into Devonshire, that so many engagements would arise to occupy their
time as shortly presented themselves, or that they should have such
frequent invitations and such constant visitors as to leave them little
leisure for serious employment. Yet such was the case. When Marianne
was recovered, the schemes of amusement at home and abroad, which Sir
John had been previously forming, were put into execution. The private
balls at the park then began; and parties on the water were made and
accomplished as often as a showery October would allow. In every
meeting of the kind Willoughby was included; and the ease and
familiarity which naturally attended these parties were exactly
calculated to give increasing intimacy to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) acquaintance with the
Dashwoods, to afford him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) opportunity of witnessing the excellencies of
Marianne, of marking his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) animated admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and of receiving,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) behaviour to himself, the most pointed assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
affection.

<p/>Elinor could not be surprised at their attachment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only wished that
it were less openly shown; and once or twice did venture to suggest the
propriety of some self-command to Marianne. But Marianne abhorred all
concealment where no real disgrace could attend unreserve; and to aim
at the restraint of sentiments which were not in themselves illaudable,
appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not merely an unnecessary effort, but a disgraceful
subjection of reason to common-place and mistaken notions. Willoughby
thought the same; and their behaviour at all times, was an illustration
of their opinions.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was present she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no eyes for any one else. Every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
did, was right. Every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) said, was clever. If their evenings at
the park were concluded with cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) cheated himself and all the rest
of the party to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a good hand. If dancing formed the amusement of
the night, they were partners for half the time; and when obliged to
separate for a couple of dances, were careful to stand together and
scarcely spoke a word to any body else. Such conduct made them of
course most exceedingly laughed at; but ridicule could not shame, and
seemed hardly to provoke them.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood entered into all their feelings with a warmth which left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) no inclination for checking this excessive display of them. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
it was but the natural consequence of a strong affection in a young and
ardent mind.

<p/>This was the season of happiness to Marianne. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was devoted to
Willoughby, and the fond attachment to Norland, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brought with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from Sussex, was more likely to be softened than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had thought it
possible before, by the charms which his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) society bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
present home.

<p/>Elinor’s happiness was not so great. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was not so much at ease,
nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) satisfaction in their amusements so pure. They afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no
companion that could make amends for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had left behind, nor that
could teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to think of Norland with less regret than ever. Neither
Lady Middleton nor Mrs. Jennings could supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) the conversation
she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) missed; although the latter was an everlasting talker, and from the
first had regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) with a kindness which ensured her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) a large share
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) discourse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had already repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own history to Elinor
three or four times; and had Elinor’s memory been equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) means of
improvement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have known very early in their acquaintance all
the particulars of Mr. Jennings’s last illness, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
wife a few minutes before he (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) died. Lady Middleton was more agreeable
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother only in being more silent. Elinor needed little
observation to perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reserve was a mere calmness of manner
with which sense had nothing to do. Towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband and mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was the same as to them; and intimacy was therefore neither to be
looked for nor desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had nothing to say one day that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not
said the day before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insipidity was invariable, for even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
spirits were always the same; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not oppose the parties
arranged by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, provided every thing were conducted in style
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) two eldest children attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) never appeared to receive
more enjoyment from them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have experienced in sitting at
home;—and so little did her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presence add to the pleasure of the others,
by any share in their conversation, that they were sometimes only
reminded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) being amongst them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
troublesome boys.

<p/>In Colonel Brandon alone, of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) new acquaintance, did Elinor find
a person who could in any degree claim the respect of abilities, excite
the interest of friendship, or give pleasure as a companion. Willoughby
was out of the question. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) admiration and regard, even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sisterly
regard, was all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was a lover; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) attentions were wholly
Marianne’s, and a far less agreeable man might have been more generally
pleasing. Colonel Brandon, unfortunately for himself, had no such
encouragement to think only of Marianne, and in conversing with Elinor
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) found the greatest consolation for the indifference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Elinor’s compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) increased, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had reason to suspect
that the misery of disappointed love had already been known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).
This suspicion was given by some words which accidentally dropped from
him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) one evening at the park, when they were sitting down together by
mutual consent, while the others were dancing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) eyes were fixed on
Marianne, and, after a silence of some minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) said, with a faint
smile, "Your sister, I understand, does not approve of second
attachments."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, <div class="bookquote">"her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions are all romantic."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Or rather, as I believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) considers them impossible to exist."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) does. But how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contrives it without reflecting on the
character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own father, who had himself two wives, I know not. A
few years however will settle her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinions on the reasonable basis of
common sense and observation; and then they may be more easy to define
and to justify than they now are, by any body but herself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This will probably be the case,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied; "and yet there is
something so amiable in the prejudices of a young mind, that one is
sorry to see them give way to the reception of more general opinions."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot agree with you there,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor. "There are inconveniences
attending such feelings as Marianne’s, which all the charms of
enthusiasm and ignorance of the world cannot atone for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) systems
have all the unfortunate tendency of setting propriety at nought; and a
better acquaintance with the world is what I look forward to as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
greatest possible advantage."

<p/>After a short pause he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) resumed the conversation by saying,—

<p/>"Does your sister make no distinction in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) objections against a
second attachment? or is it equally criminal in every body? Are those
who have been disappointed in their first choice, whether from the
inconstancy of its object, or the perverseness of circumstances, to be
equally indifferent during the rest of their lives?"

<p/>"Upon my word, I am not acquainted with the minutiae of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) principles.
I only know that I never yet heard her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) admit any instance of a second
attachment’s being pardonable."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>), "cannot hold; but a change, a total change of
sentiments—No, no, do not desire it; for when the romantic refinements
of a young mind are obliged to give way, how frequently are they
succeeded by such opinions as are but too common, and too dangerous! I
speak from experience. I once knew a lady who in temper and mind
greatly resembled your sister, who thought and judged like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), but who
from an enforced change—from a series of unfortunate circumstances—"
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) stopt suddenly; appeared to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) had said too much,
and by his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) countenance gave rise to conjectures, which might not
otherwise have entered Elinor’s head. The lady would probably have
passed without suspicion, had he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) not convinced Miss Dashwood that what
concerned her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) ought not to escape his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) lips. As it was, it required but
a slight effort of fancy to connect his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) emotion with the tender
recollection of past regard. Elinor attempted no more. But Marianne, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) place, would not have done so little. The whole story would have
been speedily formed under her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) active imagination; and every thing
established in the most melancholy order of disastrous love.
