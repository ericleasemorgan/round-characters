<p/>Till Elizabeth entered the drawing-room at Netherfield, and
looked in vain for Mr. Wickham among the cluster of red coats
there assembled, a doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) being present had never occurred
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). The certainty of meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had not been checked by any
of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had dressed with more than usual care, and prepared in
the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained
unsubdued of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) heart, trusting that it was not more than might
be won in the course of the evening. But in an instant arose the
dreadful suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) being purposely omitted for Mr. Darcy’s
pleasure in the Bingleys’ invitation to the officers; and though
this was not exactly the case, the absolute fact of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) absence
was pronounced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) friend Denny, to whom Lydia eagerly
applied, and who told them that Wickham had been obliged to go to
town on business the day before, and was not yet returned;
adding, with a significant smile, <div class="bookquote">"I do not imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) business
would have called him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) away just now, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had not wanted to
avoid a certain gentleman here."

 (<font color='red'><b>Wickham/Mr. Wickham</b></font>)</div><p/>This part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) intelligence, though unheard by Lydia, was
caught by Elizabeth, and, as it assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) that Darcy was not
less answerable for Wickham’s absence than if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) first surmise
had been just, every feeling of displeasure against the former
was so sharpened by immediate disappointment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could
hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) directly afterwards approached to make. Attendance,
forbearance, patience with Darcy, was injury to Wickham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was
resolved against any sort of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), and turned
away with a degree of ill-humour which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not wholly
surmount even in speaking to Mr. Bingley, whose blind partiality
provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/>But Elizabeth was not formed for ill-humour; and though every
prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own was destroyed for the evening, it could not
dwell long on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits; and having told all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) griefs to
Charlotte Lucas, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not seen for a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was soon
able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cousin, and to point him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) particular notice. The first
two dances, however, brought a return of distress; they were
dances of mortification. Mr. Collins, awkward and solemn,
apologising instead of attending, and often moving wrong without
being aware of it, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all the shame and misery which a
disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give. The moment
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) release from him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was ecstasy.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) danced next with an officer, and had the refreshment of
talking of Wickham, and of hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was universally liked.
When those dances were over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) returned to Charlotte Lucas, and
was in conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found herself suddenly
addressed by Mr. Darcy who took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so much by surprise in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
application for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand, that, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked away again immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was left
to fret over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own want of presence of mind; Charlotte tried to
console her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I dare say you will find him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) very agreeable."

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/>"Heaven forbid! _That_ would be the greatest misfortune of all!
To find a man agreeable whom one is determined to hate! Do not
wish me such an evil."

<p/>When the dancing recommenced, however, and Darcy approached to
claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) hand, Charlotte could not help cautioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) in a
whisper, not to be a simpleton, and allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) fancy for Wickham
to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
consequence. Elizabeth made no answer, and took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) place in the
set, amazed at the dignity to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was arrived in being
allowed to stand opposite to Mr. Darcy, and reading in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
neighbours’ looks, their equal amazement in beholding it. They
stood for some time without speaking a word; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to
imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances,
and at first was resolved not to break it; till suddenly fancying
that it would be the greater punishment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partner to oblige
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to talk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made some slight observation on the dance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
replied, and was again silent. After a pause of some minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a second time with:—"It is _your_ turn to say
something now, Mr. Darcy. _I_ talked about the dance, and _you_
ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room, or the
number of couples.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) smiled, and assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to say
should be said.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Very well. That reply will do for the present. Perhaps by and by
I may observe that private balls are much pleasanter than public
ones. But _now_ we may be silent."

<p/>"Do you talk by rule, then, while you are dancing?"

<p/>"Sometimes. One must speak a little, you know. It would look odd
to be entirely silent for half an hour together; and yet for the
advantage of _some_, conversation ought to be so arranged, as
that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible."

<p/>"Are you consulting your own feelings in the present case, or do
you imagine that you are gratifying mine?"

<p/>"Both," replied Elizabeth archly; "for I have always seen a great
similarity in the turn of our minds. We are each of an unsocial,
taciturn disposition, unwilling to speak, unless we expect to say
something that will amaze the whole room, and be handed down to
posterity with all the _éclat_ of a proverb."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is no very striking resemblance of your own character, I am
sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). "How near it may be to _mine_, I cannot pretend
to say. _You_ think it a faithful portrait undoubtedly."

<p/>"I must not decide on my own performance."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) made no answer, and they were again silent till they had gone
down the dance, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sisters did not
very often walk to Meryton. She (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) answered in the affirmative, and,
unable to resist the temptation, added, <div class="bookquote">"When you met us there
the other day, we had just been forming a new acquaintance."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>The effect was immediate. A deeper shade of _hauteur_ overspread
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) features, but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said not a word, and Elizabeth, though
blaming herself for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own weakness, could not go on. At length
Darcy spoke, and in a constrained manner said, "Mr. Wickham is
blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) _making_
friends—whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) may be equally capable of _retaining_ them, is
less certain."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has been so unlucky as to lose _your_ friendship,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied
Elizabeth with emphasis, "and in a manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is likely to
suffer from all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) life."

<p/>Darcy made no answer, and seemed desirous of changing the
subject. At that moment, Sir William Lucas appeared close to
them, meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the
room; but on perceiving Mr. Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) stopped with a bow of
superior courtesy to compliment him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dancing and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
partner.

<p/>"I have been most highly gratified indeed, my dear sir. Such very
superior dancing is not often seen. It is evident that you belong
to the first circles. Allow me to say, however, that your fair
partner does not disgrace you, and that I must hope to have this
pleasure often repeated, especially when a certain desirable
event, my dear Eliza (glancing at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) sister and Bingley) shall
take place. What congratulations will then flow in! I appeal to
Mr. Darcy:—but let me not interrupt you, sir. You will not thank
me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young
lady, whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me."

<p/>The latter part of this address was scarcely heard by Darcy; but
Sir William’s allusion to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend seemed to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
forcibly, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes were directed with a very serious
expression towards Bingley and Jane, who were dancing together.
Recovering himself, however, shortly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) partner,
and said, <div class="bookquote">"Sir William’s interruption has made me forget what we
were talking of."

 (<font color='red'><b>partner</b></font>)</div><p/>"I do not think we were speaking at all. Sir William could not
have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for
themselves. We have tried two or three subjects already without
success, and what we are to talk of next I cannot imagine."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What think you of books?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), smiling.

<p/>"Books—oh! no. I am sure we never read the same, or not with the
same feelings."

<p/>"I am sorry you think so; but if that be the case, there can at
least be no want of subject. We may compare our different
opinions."

<p/>"No—I cannot talk of books in a ball-room; my head is always full
of something else."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The _present_ always occupies you in such scenes—does it?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>), with a look of doubt.

<p/>"Yes, always," she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) replied, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) said, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) thoughts had wandered far from the subject, as soon
afterwards appeared by her (<font color='blue'><b>our</b></font>) suddenly exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">"I remember
hearing you once say, Mr. Darcy, that you hardly ever forgave,
that your resentment once created was unappeasable. You are very
cautious, I suppose, as to its _being created?_"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I am,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), with a firm voice.

<p/>"And never allow yourself to be blinded by prejudice?"

<p/>"I hope not."

<p/>"It is particularly incumbent on those who never change their
opinion, to be secure of judging properly at first."

<p/>"May I ask to what these questions tend?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Merely to the illustration of _your_ character,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>),
endeavouring to shake off her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gravity. "I am trying to make it
out."

<p/>"And what is your success?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) head. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not get on at all. I hear such
different accounts of you as puzzle me exceedingly."

<p/>"I can readily believe,<div class="bookquote">" answered he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) gravely, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that reports may
vary greatly with respect to me; and I could wish, Miss Bennet,
that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment,
as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no
credit on either."

<p/>"But if I do not take your likeness now, I may never have another
opportunity."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) coldly
replied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said no more, and they went down the other dance and
parted in silence; and on each side dissatisfied, though not to
an equal degree, for in Darcy’s breast there was a tolerably
powerful feeling towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), which soon procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) pardon, and
directed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) anger against another.

<p/>They had not long separated, when Miss Bingley came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>),
and with an expression of civil disdain accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>):

<p/>"So, Miss Eliza, I hear you are quite delighted with George
Wickham! Your sister has been talking to me about him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), and asking
me a thousand questions; and I find that the young man quite
forgot to tell you, among his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) other communication, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
the son of old Wickham, the late Mr. Darcy’s steward. Let me
recommend you, however, as a friend, not to give implicit
confidence to all his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) assertions; for as to Mr. Darcy’s using him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
ill, it is perfectly false; for, on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has always
been remarkably kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), though George Wickham has treated
Mr. Darcy in a most infamous manner. I do not know the
particulars, but I know very well that Mr. Darcy is not in the
least to blame, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cannot bear to hear George Wickham
mentioned, and that though my brother thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could not
well avoid including him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) invitation to the officers, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
was excessively glad to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had taken himself out of the
way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing,
indeed, and I wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could presume to do it. I pity you,
Miss Eliza, for this discovery of your favourite’s guilt; but
really, considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) descent, one could not expect much
better."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) guilt and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) descent appear by your account to be the
same,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth angrily; "for I have heard you accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy’s steward,
and of _that_, I can assure you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) informed me himself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I beg your pardon,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Bingley, turning away with a
sneer. "Excuse my interference—it was kindly meant."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Insolent girl!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth to herself. "You are much
mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as
this. I see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the
malice of Mr. Darcy." She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eldest sister, who had
undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of Bingley. Jane
met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) with a smile of such sweet complacency, a glow of such
happy expression, as sufficiently marked how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was
satisfied with the occurrences of the evening. Elizabeth
instantly read her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings, and at that moment solicitude for
Wickham, resentment against his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) enemies, and everything else,
gave way before the hope of Jane’s being in the fairest way for
happiness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I want to know,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), with a countenance no less smiling
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister’s, "what you have learnt about Mr. Wickham. But
perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any
third person; in which case you may be sure of my pardon."

<p/>"No," replied Jane, "I have not forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but I have nothing
satisfactory to tell you. Mr. Bingley does not know the whole of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) history, and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which
have principally offended Mr. Darcy; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will vouch for the
good conduct, the probity, and honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend, and is
perfectly convinced that Mr. Wickham has deserved much less
attention from Mr. Darcy than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has received; and I am sorry to
say by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister’s, Mr. Wickham is by no
means a respectable young man. I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has been very
imprudent, and has deserved to lose Mr. Darcy’s regard.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bingley does not know Mr. Wickham himself?"

<p/>"No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) till the other morning at Meryton."

<p/>"This account then is what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has received from Mr. Darcy. I am
satisfied. But what does he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) say of the living?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does not exactly recollect the circumstances, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has
heard them from Mr. Darcy more than once, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believes that it
was left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) _conditionally_ only."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley’s sincerity,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth
warmly; "but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances
only. Mr. Bingley’s defense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend was a very able one, I
dare say; but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is unacquainted with several parts of the
story, and has learnt the rest from that friend himself, I shall
venture to still think of both gentlemen as I did before."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each,
and on which there could be no difference of sentiment. Elizabeth
listened with delight to the happy, though modest hopes which
Jane entertained of Mr. Bingley’s regard, and said all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
power to heighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) confidence in it. On their being joined by
Mr. Bingley himself, Elizabeth withdrew to Miss Lucas; to whose
enquiry after the pleasantness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) last partner she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
scarcely replied, before Mr. Collins came up to them, and told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with great exultation that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had just been so fortunate as
to make a most important discovery.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have found out,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), "by a singular accident, that there
is now in the room a near relation of my patroness. I happened to
overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who
does the honours of the house the names of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cousin Miss de
Bourgh, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother Lady Catherine. How wonderfully these
sort of things occur! Who would have thought of my meeting with,
perhaps, a nephew of Lady Catherine de Bourgh in this assembly! I
am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay
my respects to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), which I am now going to do, and trust he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) will
excuse my not having done it before. My total ignorance of the
connection must plead my apology."

<p/>"You are not going to introduce yourself to Mr. Darcy!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed I am. I shall entreat his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pardon for not having done it
earlier. I believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be Lady Catherine’s _nephew_. It will
be in my power to assure him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship was quite well
yesterday se’ (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>nnight."

<p/>Elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) from such a scheme, assuring
him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) that Mr. Darcy would consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) without
introduction as an impertinent freedom, rather than a compliment
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt; that it was not in the least necessary there should
be any notice on either side; and that if it were, it must belong
to Mr. Darcy, the superior in consequence, to begin the
acquaintance. Mr. Collins listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with the determined air
of following his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own inclination, and, when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ceased speaking,
replied thus:

<p/>"My dear Miss Elizabeth, I have the highest opinion in the world
in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of
your understanding; but permit me to say, that there must be a
wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst
the laity, and those which regulate the clergy; for, give me
leave to observe that I consider the clerical office as equal in
point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdom—provided
that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time
maintained. You must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of
my conscience on this occasion, which leads me to perform what I
look on as a point of duty. Pardon me for neglecting to profit by
your advice, which on every other subject shall be my constant
guide, though in the case before us I consider myself more fitted
by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a
young lady like yourself." And with a low bow he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to
attack Mr. Darcy, whose reception of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) advances she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) eagerly
watched, and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very
evident. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cousin prefaced his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) speech with a solemn bow and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could not hear a word of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt as if hearing it
all, and saw in the motion of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) lips the words <div class="bookquote">"apology,"
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"Hunsford,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"Lady Catherine de Bourgh."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) expose himself to such a man. Mr. Darcy was eyeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with
unrestrained wonder, and when at last Mr. Collins allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
time to speak, replied with an air of distant civility. Mr.
Collins, however, was not discouraged from speaking again, and
Mr. Darcy’s contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) second speech, and at the end of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a
slight bow, and moved another way. Mr. Collins then returned to
Elizabeth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have no reason, I assure you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), "to be dissatisfied
with my reception. Mr. Darcy seemed much pleased with the
attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) answered me with the utmost civility, and even paid
me the compliment of saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was so well convinced of Lady
Catherine’s discernment as to be certain she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could never bestow a
favour unworthily. It was really a very handsome thought. Upon
the whole, I am much pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/>As Elizabeth had no longer any interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own to pursue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attention almost entirely on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister and Mr.
Bingley; and the train of agreeable reflections which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
observations gave birth to, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) perhaps almost as happy as
Jane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in idea settled in that very house, in all the
felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
felt capable, under such circumstances, of endeavouring even to
like Bingley’s two sisters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s thoughts she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) plainly saw
were bent the same way, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) determined not to venture near
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might hear too much. When they sat down to supper,
therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considered it a most unlucky perverseness which
placed them within one of each other; and deeply was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vexed to
find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother was talking to that one person (Lady Lucas)
freely, openly, and of nothing else but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) expectation that Jane
would soon be married to Mr. Bingley. It was an animating
subject, and Mrs. Bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while
enumerating the advantages of the match. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being such a
charming young man, and so rich, and living but three miles from
them, were the first points of self-gratulation; and then it was
such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of Jane,
and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could do. It was, moreover, such a promising thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
younger daughters, as Jane’s marrying so greatly must throw them
in the way of other rich men; and lastly, it was so pleasant at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) time of life to be able to consign her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) single daughters to
the care of their sister, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might not be obliged to go
into company more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) liked. It was necessary to make this
circumstance a matter of pleasure, because on such occasions it
is the etiquette; but no one was less likely than Mrs. Bennet to
find comfort in staying home at any period of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
concluded with many good wishes that Lady Lucas might soon be
equally fortunate, though evidently and triumphantly believing
there was no chance of it.

<p/>In vain did Elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother’s words, or persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felicity in a
less audible whisper; for, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inexpressible vexation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by Mr. Darcy,
who sat opposite to them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother only scolded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for being
nonsensical.

<p/>"What is Mr. Darcy to me, pray, that I should be afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)? I
am sure we owe him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) no such particular civility as to be obliged
to say nothing _he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ may not like to hear."

<p/>"For heaven’s sake, madam, speak lower. What advantage can it be
for you to offend Mr. Darcy? You will never recommend yourself to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend by so doing!"

<p/>Nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) could say, however, had any influence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>)
mother would talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) views in the same intelligible tone.
Elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not help frequently glancing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eye at Mr. Darcy, though
every glance convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
not always looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was convinced that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
attention was invariably fixed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). The expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face
changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and
steady gravity.

<p/>At length, however, Mrs. Bennet had no more to say; and Lady
Lucas, who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) saw no likelihood of sharing, was left to the comforts
of cold ham and chicken. Elizabeth now began to revive. But not
long was the interval of tranquillity; for, when supper was over,
singing was talked of, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the mortification of seeing
Mary, after very little entreaty, preparing to oblige the
company. By many significant looks and silent entreaties, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance, but in vain;
Mary would not understand them; such an opportunity of exhibiting
was delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) song. Elizabeth’s eyes
were fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with most painful sensations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which
was very ill rewarded at their close; for Mary, on receiving,
amongst the thanks of the table, the hint of a hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
might be prevailed on to favour them again, after the pause of
half a minute began another. Mary’s powers were by no means
fitted for such a display; her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) voice was weak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) manner
affected. Elizabeth was in agonies. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked at Jane, to see
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bore it; but Jane was very composedly talking to Bingley.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) two sisters, and saw them making signs of
derision at each other, and at Darcy, who continued, however,
imperturbably grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father to entreat his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
interference, lest Mary should be singing all night. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) took the
hint, and when Mary had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) second song, said aloud,
"That will do extremely well, child. You have delighted us long
enough. Let the other young ladies have time to exhibit."

<p/>Mary, though pretending not to hear, was somewhat disconcerted;
and Elizabeth, sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father’s speech,
was afraid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anxiety had done no good. Others of the party were
now applied to.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Collins, "were so fortunate as to be able to
sing, I should have great pleasure, I am sure, in obliging the
company with an air; for I consider music as a very innocent
diversion, and perfectly compatible with the profession of a
clergyman. I do not mean, however, to assert that we can be
justified in devoting too much of our time to music, for there
are certainly other things to be attended to. The rector of a
parish has much to do. In the first place, he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) must make such an
agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not
offensive to his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) patron. He (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) must write his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) own sermons; and the
time that remains will not be too much for his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) parish duties, and
the care and improvement of his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) dwelling, which he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) cannot be
excused from making as comfortable as possible. And I do not
think it of light importance that he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) should have attentive and
conciliatory manners towards everybody, especially towards those
to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) owes his (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) preferment. I cannot acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>rector</b></font>) of that duty;
nor could I think well of the man who should omit an occasion of
testifying his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) respect towards anybody connected with the
family." And with a bow to Mr. Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) speech,
which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room.
Many stared—many smiled; but no one looked more amused than Mr.
Bennet himself, while his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife seriously commended Mr. Collins
for having spoken so sensibly, and observed in a half-whisper to
Lady Lucas, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was a remarkably clever, good kind of young
man.

<p/>To Elizabeth it appeared that, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family made an agreement
to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening, it
would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more
spirit or finer success; and happy did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) think it for Bingley
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
notice, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings were not of a sort to be much
distressed by the folly which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must have witnessed. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
two sisters and Mr. Darcy, however, should have such an
opportunity of ridiculing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations, was bad enough, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman,
or the insolent smiles of the ladies, were more intolerable.

<p/>The rest of the evening brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) little amusement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
teased by Mr. Collins, who continued most perseveringly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
side, and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could not prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
again, put it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to dance with others. In vain did
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to stand up with somebody else, and offer to
introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to any young lady in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), that
as to dancing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was perfectly indifferent to it; that his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) chief
object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) should therefore make a point of remaining close to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
the whole evening. There was no arguing upon such a project. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
owed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) greatest relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) friend Miss Lucas, who often
joined them, and good-naturedly engaged Mr. Collins’s
conversation to herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was at least free from the offense of Mr. Darcy’s further
notice; though often standing within a very short distance of
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), quite disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) never came near enough to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
felt it to be the probable consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) allusions to Mr.
Wickham, and rejoiced in it.

<p/>The Longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart,
and, by a manoeuvre of Mrs. Bennet, had to wait for their
carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone,
which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by
some of the family. Mrs. Hurst and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister scarcely opened
their mouths, except to complain of fatigue, and were evidently
impatient to have the house to themselves. They repulsed every
attempt of Mrs. Bennet at conversation, and by so doing threw a
languor over the whole party, which was very little relieved by
the long speeches of Mr. Collins, who was complimenting Mr.
Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters on the elegance of their entertainment,
and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their
behaviour to their guests. Darcy said nothing at all. Mr. Bennet,
in equal silence, was enjoying the scene. Mr. Bingley and Jane
were standing together, a little detached from the rest, and
talked only to each other. Elizabeth preserved as steady a
silence as either Mrs. Hurst or Miss Bingley; and even Lydia was
too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation
of <div class="bookquote">"Lord, how tired I am!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>accompanied by a violent yawn.

<p/>When at length they arose to take leave, Mrs. Bennet was most
pressingly civil in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hope of seeing the whole family soon at
Longbourn, and addressed herself especially to Mr. Bingley, to
assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) how happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would make them by eating a family dinner
with them at any time, without the ceremony of a formal
invitation. Bingley was all grateful pleasure, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) readily
engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>),
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) return from London, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was obliged to go the
next day for a short time.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was perfectly satisfied, and quitted the house under
the delightful persuasion that, allowing for the necessary
preparations of settlements, new carriages, and wedding clothes,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should undoubtedly see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter settled at Netherfield in
the course of three or four months. Of having another daughter
married to Mr. Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought with equal certainty, and
with considerable, though not equal, pleasure. Elizabeth was the
least dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) children; and though the man and the
match were quite good enough for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_, the worth of each was
eclipsed by Mr. Bingley and Netherfield.
