<p/>The Prices were just setting off for church the next day when Mr.
Crawford appeared again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) came, not to stop, but to join them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
asked to go with them to the Garrison chapel, which was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Garrison</b></font>)
had intended, and they all walked thither together.

<p/>The family were now seen to advantage. Nature had given them no
inconsiderable share of beauty, and every Sunday dressed them in their
cleanest skins and best attire. Sunday always brought this comfort to
Fanny, and on this Sunday she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it more than ever. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor mother
now did not look so very unworthy of being Lady Bertram’s sister as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was but too apt to look. It often grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to the heart to think of
the contrast between them; to think that where nature had made so
little difference, circumstances should have made so much, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
mother, as handsome as Lady Bertram, and some years her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) junior, should
have an appearance so much more worn and faded, so comfortless, so
slatternly, so shabby. But Sunday made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) a very creditable and
tolerably cheerful-looking Mrs. Price, coming abroad with a fine family
of children, feeling a little respite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) weekly cares, and only
discomposed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) boys run into danger, or Rebecca pass by
with a flower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) hat.

<p/>In chapel they were obliged to divide, but Mr. Crawford took care not
to be divided from the female branch; and after chapel he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) still
continued with them, and made one in the family party on the ramparts.

<p/>Mrs. Price took her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) weekly walk on the ramparts every fine Sunday
throughout the year, always going directly after morning service and
staying till dinner-time. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) public place: there she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
acquaintance, heard a little news, talked over the badness of the
Portsmouth servants, and wound up her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) spirits for the six days ensuing.

<p/>Thither they now went; Mr. Crawford most happy to consider the Miss
Prices as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) peculiar charge; and before they had been there long,
somehow or other, there was no saying how, Fanny could not have
believed it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was walking between them with an arm of each under
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to prevent or put an end to it. It made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncomfortable for a time, but yet there were enjoyments in the day
and in the view which would be felt.

<p/>The day was uncommonly lovely. It was really March; but it was April in
its mild air, brisk soft wind, and bright sun, occasionally clouded for
a minute; and everything looked so beautiful under the influence of
such a sky, the effects of the shadows pursuing each other on the ships
at Spithead and the island beyond, with the ever-varying hues of the
sea, now at high water, dancing in its glee and dashing against the
ramparts with so fine a sound, produced altogether such a combination
of charms for Fanny, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gradually almost careless of the
circumstances under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt them. Nay, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been without his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
arm, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would soon have known that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) needed it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted
strength for a two hours’ saunter of this kind, coming, as it generally
did, upon a week’s previous inactivity. Fanny was beginning to feel the
effect of being debarred from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usual regular exercise; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lost
ground as to health since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being in Portsmouth; and but for Mr.
Crawford and the beauty of the weather would soon have been knocked up
now.

<p/>The loveliness of the day, and of the view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt like herself. They
often stopt with the same sentiment and taste, leaning against the
wall, some minutes, to look and admire; and considering he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not
Edmund, Fanny could not but allow that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was sufficiently open to the
charms of nature, and very well able to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
a few tender reveries now and then, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could sometimes take
advantage of to look in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face without detection; and the result of
these looks was, that though as bewitching as ever, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face was less
blooming than it ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _said_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very well, and did not
like to be supposed otherwise; but take it all in all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was convinced
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present residence could not be comfortable, and therefore
could not be salutary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was growing anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being
again at Mansfield, where her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own happiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
must be so much greater.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have been here a month, I think?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>"No; not quite a month. It is only four weeks to-morrow since I left
Mansfield."

<p/>"You are a most accurate and honest reckoner. I should call that a
month."

<p/>"I did not arrive here till Tuesday evening."

<p/>"And it is to be a two months’ visit, is not?"

<p/>"Yes. My uncle talked of two months. I suppose it will not be less."

<p/>"And how are you to be conveyed back again? Who comes for you?"

<p/>"I do not know. I have heard nothing about it yet from my aunt. Perhaps
I may be to stay longer. It may not be convenient for me to be fetched
exactly at the two months’ end."

<p/>After a moment’s reflection, Mr. Crawford replied, <div class="bookquote">"I know Mansfield, I
know its way, I know its faults towards _you_. I know the danger of
your being so far forgotten, as to have your comforts give way to the
imaginary convenience of any single being in the family. I am aware
that you may be left here week after week, if Sir Thomas cannot settle
everything for coming himself, or sending your aunt’s maid for you,
without involving the slightest alteration of the arrangements which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
may have laid down for the next quarter of a year. This will not do.
Two months is an ample allowance; I should think six weeks quite
enough. I am considering your sister’s health,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), addressing
himself to Susan, "which I think the confinement of Portsmouth
unfavourable to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) requires constant air and exercise. When you know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) as well as I do, I am sure you will agree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) does, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) ought never to be long banished from the free air and liberty of
the country. If, therefore" (turning again to Fanny), "you find
yourself growing unwell, and any difficulties arise about your
returning to Mansfield, without waiting for the two months to be ended,
_that_ must not be regarded as of any consequence, if you feel yourself
at all less strong or comfortable than usual, and will only let my
sister know it, give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) only the slightest hint, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and I will
immediately come down, and take you back to Mansfield. You know the
ease and the pleasure with which this would be done. You know all that
would be felt on the occasion.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>), but tried to laugh it off.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am perfectly serious," he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) replied, "as you perfectly know. And I
hope you will not be cruelly concealing any tendency to indisposition.
Indeed, you shall _not_; it shall not be in your power; for so long
only as you positively say, in every letter to Mary, <div class="bookquote">‘I am well,’  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>and I
know you cannot speak or write a falsehood, so long only shall you be
considered as well."

<p/>Fanny thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) again, but was affected and distressed to a degree
that made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to say much, or even to be certain of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to say. This was towards the close of their walk. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
attended them to the last, and left them only at the door of their own
house, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) knew them to be going to dinner, and therefore pretended
to be waited for elsewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wish you were not so tired,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>), still detaining Fanny after
all the others were in the house—"I wish I left you in stronger health.
Is there anything I can do for you in town? I have half an idea of
going into Norfolk again soon. I am not satisfied about Maddison. I am
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) still means to impose on me if possible, and get a cousin of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) own into a certain mill, which I design for somebody else. I must
come to an understanding with him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>). I must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) know that I will not
be tricked on the south side of Everingham, any more than on the north:
that I will be master of my own property. I was not explicit enough
with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) before. The mischief such a man does on an estate, both as to
the credit of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) employer and the welfare of the poor, is
inconceivable. I have a great mind to go back into Norfolk directly,
and put everything at once on such a footing as cannot be afterwards
swerved from. Maddison is a clever fellow; I do not wish to displace
him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>), provided he (<font color='blue'><b>Maddison</b></font>) does not try to displace _me_; but it would be simple
to be duped by a man who has no right of creditor to dupe me, and worse
than simple to let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) give me a hard-hearted, griping fellow for a
tenant, instead of an honest man, to whom I have given half a promise
already. Would it not be worse than simple? Shall I go? Do you advise
it?"

<p/>"I advise! You know very well what is right."

<p/>"Yes. When you give me your opinion, I always know what is right. Your
judgment is my rule of right."

<p/>"Oh, no! do not say so. We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we
would attend to it, than any other person can be. Good-bye; I wish you
a pleasant journey to-morrow."

<p/>"Is there nothing I can do for you in town?"

<p/>"Nothing; I am much obliged to you."

<p/>"Have you no message for anybody?"

<p/>"My love to your sister, if you please; and when you see my cousin, my
cousin Edmund, I wish you would be so good as to say that I suppose I
shall soon hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)."

<p/>"Certainly; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is lazy or negligent, I will write his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) excuses
myself."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could say no more, for Fanny would be no longer detained. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and was gone. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ went to while away the next
three hours as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) other acquaintance, till the best
dinner that a capital inn afforded was ready for their enjoyment, and
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ turned in to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more simple one immediately.

<p/>Their general fare bore a very different character; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) have
suspected how many privations, besides that of exercise, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) endured in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father’s house, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would have wondered that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks were not much
more affected than he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) found them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so little equal to Rebecca’s
puddings and Rebecca’s hashes, brought to table, as they all were, with
such accompaniments of half-cleaned plates, and not half-cleaned knives
and forks, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was very often constrained to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) heartiest
meal till she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) could send her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) brothers in the evening for biscuits and
buns. After being nursed up at Mansfield, it was too late in the day to
be hardened at Portsmouth; and though Sir Thomas, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) known all,
might have thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece in the most promising way of being
starved, both mind and body, into a much juster value for Mr.
Crawford’s good company and good fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would probably have feared
to push his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) experiment farther, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might die under the cure.

<p/>Fanny was out of spirits all the rest of the day. Though tolerably
secure of not seeing Mr. Crawford again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help being low.
It was parting with somebody of the nature of a friend; and though, in
one light, glad to have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) gone, it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now deserted
by everybody; it was a sort of renewed separation from Mansfield; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not think of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) returning to town, and being frequently with
Mary and Edmund, without feelings so near akin to envy as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hate
herself for having them.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dejection had no abatement from anything passing around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); a
friend or two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father’s, as always happened if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was not with
them, spent the long, long evening there; and from six o’clock till
half-past nine, there was little intermission of noise or grog. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
very low. The wonderful improvement which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) still fancied in Mr.
Crawford was the nearest to administering comfort of anything within
the current of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thoughts. Not considering in how different a circle
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been just seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), nor how much might be owing to contrast,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was quite persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being astonishingly more gentle and
regardful of others than formerly. And, if in little things, must it
not be so in great? So anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) health and comfort, so very
feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) now expressed himself, and really seemed, might not it be
fairly supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would not much longer persevere in a suit so
distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?
