<p/>When the particulars of this conversation were repeated by Miss
Dashwood to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister, as they very soon were, the effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
not entirely such as the former had hoped to see. Not that Marianne
appeared to distrust the truth of any part of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) listened to
it all with the most steady and submissive attention, made neither
objection nor remark, attempted no vindication of Willoughby, and
seemed to show by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt it to be impossible. But
though this behaviour assured Elinor that the conviction of this guilt
_was_ carried home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw with satisfaction the
effect of it, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no longer avoiding Colonel Brandon when he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) called,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), even voluntarily speaking, with a kind of
compassionate respect, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits less violently
irritated than before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) less wretched. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind did
become settled, but it was settled in a gloomy dejection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt the
loss of Willoughby’s character yet more heavily than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt the
loss of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) heart; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) seduction and desertion of Miss Williams, the
misery of that poor girl, and the doubt of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) designs might
_once_ have been on herself, preyed altogether so much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) spirits,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) could not bring herself to speak of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) felt even to
Elinor; and, brooding over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows in silence, gave more pain to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister than could have been communicated by the most open and most
frequent confession of them.

<p/>To give the feelings or the language of Mrs. Dashwood on receiving and
answering Elinor’s letter would be only to give a repetition of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughters had already felt and said; of a disappointment hardly
less painful than Marianne’s, and an indignation even greater than
Elinor’s. Long letters from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), quickly succeeding each other, arrived
to tell all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffered and thought; to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) anxious
solicitude for Marianne, and entreat she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would bear up with fortitude
under this misfortune. Bad indeed must the nature of Marianne’s
affliction be, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother could talk of fortitude! mortifying and
humiliating must be the origin of those regrets, which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ could wish
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not to indulge!

<p/>Against the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own individual comfort, Mrs. Dashwood had
determined that it would be better for Marianne to be any where, at
that time, than at Barton, where every thing within her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) view would be
bringing back the past in the strongest and most afflicting manner, by
constantly placing Willoughby before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had always seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) there. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recommended it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughters, therefore, by all means
not to shorten their visit to Mrs. Jennings; the length of which,
though never exactly fixed, had been expected by all to comprise at
least five or six weeks. A variety of occupations, of objects, and of
company, which could not be procured at Barton, would be inevitable
there, and might yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) hoped, cheat Marianne, at times, into some
interest beyond herself, and even into some amusement, much as the
ideas of both might now be spurned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>From all danger of seeing Willoughby again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to be at least equally safe in town as in the country, since his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
acquaintance must now be dropped by all who called themselves her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
friends. Design could never bring them in each other’s way: negligence
could never leave them exposed to a surprise; and chance had less in
its favour in the crowd of London than even in the retirement of
Barton, where it might force him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) while paying that visit at
Allenham on his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) marriage, which Mrs. Dashwood, from foreseeing at first
as a probable event, had brought herself to expect as a certain one.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had yet another reason for wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children to remain where
they were; a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son-in-law had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wife were to be in town before the middle of February, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) judged
it right that they should sometimes see their brother.

<p/>Marianne had promised to be guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother’s opinion, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
submitted to it therefore without opposition, though it proved
perfectly different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wished and expected, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt
it to be entirely wrong, formed on mistaken grounds, and that by
requiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) longer continuance in London it deprived her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) of the only
possible alleviation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wretchedness, the personal sympathy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother, and doomed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to such society and such scenes as must prevent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ever knowing a moment’s rest.

<p/>But it was a matter of great consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), that what brought evil
to herself would bring good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister; and Elinor, on the other
hand, suspecting that it would not be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) power to avoid Edward
entirely, comforted herself by thinking, that though their longer stay
would therefore militate against her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own happiness, it would be better
for Marianne than an immediate return into Devonshire.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) carefulness in guarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister from ever hearing Willoughby’s
name mentioned, was not thrown away. Marianne, though without knowing
it herself, reaped all its advantage; for neither Mrs. Jennings, nor
Sir John, nor even Mrs. Palmer herself, ever spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) before her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).
Elinor wished that the same forbearance could have extended towards
herself, but that was impossible, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was obliged to listen day
after day to the indignation of them all.

<p/>Sir John, could not have thought it possible. "A man of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
always had such reason to think well! Such a good-natured fellow! He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
did not believe there was a bolder rider in England! It was an
unaccountable business. He (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) at the devil with all his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) heart.
He (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) would not speak another word to him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>), meet him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) might, for
all the world! No, not if it were to be by the side of Barton covert,
and they were kept watching for two hours together. Such a scoundrel of
a fellow! such a deceitful dog! It was only the last time they met that
he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had offered him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) one of Folly’s puppies! and this was the end of it!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Palmer, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) way, was equally angry. " (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was determined to drop
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) acquaintance immediately, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was very thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had
never been acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wished with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) heart
Combe Magna was not so near Cleveland; but it did not signify, for it
was a great deal too far off to visit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) hated him (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) so much that she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
was resolved never to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) name again, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) should tell
everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) saw, how good-for-nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) was."

<p/>The rest of Mrs. Palmer’s sympathy was shown in procuring all the
particulars in her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) power of the approaching marriage, and communicating
them to Elinor. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could soon tell at what coachmaker’s the new
carriage was building, by what painter Mr. Willoughby’s portrait was
drawn, and at what warehouse Miss Grey’s clothes might be seen.

<p/>The calm and polite unconcern of Lady Middleton on the occasion was a
happy relief to Elinor’s spirits, oppressed as they often were by the
clamorous kindness of the others. It was a great comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be
sure of exciting no interest in _one_ person at least among their
circle of friends: a great comfort to know that there was _one_ who
would meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without feeling any curiosity after particulars, or any
anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s health.

<p/>Every qualification is raised at times, by the circumstances of the
moment, to more than its real value; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was sometimes worried down
by officious condolence to rate good-breeding as more indispensable to
comfort than good-nature.

<p/>Lady Middleton expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sense of the affair about once every day,
or twice, if the subject occurred very often, by saying, <div class="bookquote">"It is very
shocking, indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton</b></font>)</div>and by the means of this continual though gentle
vent, was able not only to see the Miss Dashwoods from the first
without the smallest emotion, but very soon to see them without
recollecting a word of the matter; and having thus supported the
dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own sex, and spoken her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) decided censure of what was
wrong in the other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) thought herself at liberty to attend to the
interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own assemblies, and therefore determined (though rather
against the opinion of Sir John) that as Mrs. Willoughby would at once
be a woman of elegance and fortune, to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) card with her (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) as soon
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) married.

<p/>Colonel Brandon’s delicate, unobtrusive enquiries were never unwelcome
to Miss Dashwood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had abundantly earned the privilege of intimate
discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister’s disappointment, by the friendly zeal with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had endeavoured to soften it, and they always conversed with
confidence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) chief reward for the painful exertion of disclosing
past sorrows and present humiliations, was given in the pitying eye
with which Marianne sometimes observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), and the gentleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
voice whenever (though it did not often happen) she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was obliged, or
could oblige herself to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). _These_ assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
exertion had produced an increase of good-will towards himself, and
_these_ gave Elinor hopes of its being farther augmented hereafter; but
Mrs. Jennings, who knew nothing of all this, who knew only that the
Colonel continued as grave as ever, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could neither prevail
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to make the offer himself, nor commission her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to make it for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), began, at the end of two days, to think that, instead of
Midsummer, they would not be married till Michaelmas, and by the end of
a week that it would not be a match at all. The good understanding
between the Colonel and Miss Dashwood seemed rather to declare that the
honours of the mulberry-tree, the canal, and the yew arbour, would all
be made over to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>);_ and Mrs. Jennings had, for some time ceased to
think at all of Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/>Early in February, within a fortnight from the receipt of Willoughby’s
letter, Elinor had the painful office of informing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
was married. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had taken care to have the intelligence conveyed to
herself, as soon as it was known that the ceremony was over, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
desirous that Marianne should not receive the first notice of it from
the public papers, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eagerly examining every morning.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) received the news with resolute composure; made no observation on
it, and at first shed no tears; but after a short time they would burst
out, and for the rest of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was in a state hardly less
pitiable than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) first learnt to expect the event.

<p/>The Willoughbys left town as soon as they were married; and Elinor now
hoped, as there could be no danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) seeing either of them, to
prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, who had never yet left the house since the blow
first fell, to go out again by degrees as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done before.

<p/>About this time the two Miss Steeles, lately arrived at their cousin’s
house in Bartlett’s Buildings, Holburn, presented themselves again
before their more grand relations in Conduit and Berkeley Streets; and
were welcomed by them all with great cordiality.

<p/>Elinor only was sorry to see them. Their presence always gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pain,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew how to make a very gracious return to the
overpowering delight of Lucy in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) _still_ in town.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should have been quite disappointed if I had not found you here
_still_,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) repeatedly, with a strong emphasis on the word. "But
I always thought I _should_. I was almost sure you would not leave
London yet awhile; though you _told_ me, you know, at Barton, that you
should not stay above a _month_. But I thought, at the time, that you
would most likely change your mind when it came to the point. It would
have been such a great pity to have went away before your brother and
sister came. And now to be sure you will be in no _hurry_ to be gone. I
am amazingly glad you did not keep to _your word_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor perfectly understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and was forced to use all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-command to make it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did _not_.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>Well, my dear," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did you travel?"

<p/>"Not in the stage, I assure you," replied Miss Steele, with quick
exultation; "we came post all the way, and had a very smart beau to
attend us. Dr. Davies was coming to town, and so we thought we’d join
him (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) in a post-chaise; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Davies</b></font>) behaved very genteelly, and paid ten or
twelve shillings more than we did."

<p/>"Oh, oh!" cried Mrs. Jennings; "very pretty, indeed! and the Doctor is
a single man, I warrant you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele, affectedly simpering, "everybody laughs
at me so about the Doctor, and I cannot think why. My cousins say they
are sure I have made a conquest; but for my part I declare I never
think about him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) from one hour’s end to another. <div class="bookquote">‘Lord! here comes your
beau, Nancy,’  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>my cousin said t’other day, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) crossing the
street to the house. My beau, indeed! said I—I cannot think who you
mean. The Doctor is no beau of mine."

<p/>"Aye, aye, that is very pretty talking—but it won’t do—the Doctor is
the man, I see."

<p/>"No, indeed!<div class="bookquote">" replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) cousin, with affected earnestness, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I beg
you will contradict it, if you ever hear it talked of.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Jennings directly gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) the gratifying assurance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
certainly would _not_, and Miss Steele was made completely happy.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suppose you will go and stay with your brother and sister, Miss
Dashwood, when they come to town," said Lucy, returning, after a
cessation of hostile hints, to the charge.

<p/>"No, I do not think we shall."

<p/>"Oh, yes, I dare say you will.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor would not humour her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by farther opposition.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>What a charming thing it is that Mrs. Dashwood can spare you both for
so long a time together!"

<p/>"Long a time, indeed!<div class="bookquote">" interposed Mrs. Jennings. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Why, their visit is
but just begun!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lucy was silenced.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sorry we cannot see your sister, Miss Dashwood," said Miss
Steele. "I am sorry she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) is not well—<div class="bookquote">" for Marianne had left the room on
their arrival.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You are very good. My sister will be equally sorry to miss the
pleasure of seeing you; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been very much plagued lately with
nervous head-aches, which make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) unfit for company or conversation."

<p/>"Oh, dear, that is a great pity! but such old friends as Lucy and me!—I
think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might see _us;_ and I am sure we would not speak a word."

<p/>Elinor, with great civility, declined the proposal. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was
perhaps laid down upon the bed, or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dressing gown, and therefore
not able to come to them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, if that’s all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Steele</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Steele, <div class="bookquote">"we can just as well go and see
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)_."

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Steele</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor began to find this impertinence too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) temper; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was saved the trouble of checking it, by Lucy’s sharp reprimand, which
now, as on many occasions, though it did not give much sweetness to the
manners of one sister, was of advantage in governing those of the
other.
