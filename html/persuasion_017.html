<p/>While Sir Walter and Elizabeth were assiduously pushing their good
fortune in Laura Place, Anne was renewing an acquaintance of a very
different description.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) former governess, and had heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of there
being an old school-fellow in Bath, who had the two strong claims on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention of past kindness and present suffering.  Miss Hamilton,
now Mrs Smith, had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) kindness in one of those periods of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
life when it had been most valuable.  Anne had gone unhappy to school,
grieving for the loss of a mother whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had dearly loved, feeling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) separation from home, and suffering as a girl of fourteen, of
strong sensibility and not high spirits, must suffer at such a time;
and Miss Hamilton, three years older than herself, but still from the
want of near relations and a settled home, remaining another year at
school, had been useful and good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) in a way which had considerably
lessened her (<font color='blue'><b>Hamilton</b></font>) misery, and could never be remembered with indifference.

<p/>Miss Hamilton had left school, had married not long afterwards, was
said to have married a man of fortune, and this was all that Anne had
known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), till now that their governess's account brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
situation forward in a more decided but very different form.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was a widow and poor.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband had been extravagant; and at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
death, about two years before, had left his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) affairs dreadfully
involved.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had difficulties of every sort to contend with, and
in addition to these distresses had been afflicted with a severe
rheumatic fever, which, finally settling in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) legs, had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for
the present a cripple.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had come to Bath on that account, and was
now in lodgings near the hot baths, living in a very humble way, unable
even to afford herself the comfort of a servant, and of course almost
excluded from society.

<p/>Their mutual friend answered for the satisfaction which a visit from
Miss Elliot would give Mrs Smith, and Anne therefore lost no time in
going.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mentioned nothing of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard, or what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
intended, at home.  It would excite no proper interest there.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only
consulted Lady Russell, who entered thoroughly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sentiments, and
was most happy to convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as near to Mrs Smith's lodgings in
Westgate Buildings, as Anne chose to be taken.

<p/>The visit was paid, their acquaintance re-established, their interest
in each other more than re-kindled.  The first ten minutes had its
awkwardness and its emotion.  Twelve years were gone since they had
parted, and each presented a somewhat different person from what the
other had imagined.  Twelve years had changed Anne from the blooming,
silent, unformed girl of fifteen, to the elegant little woman of
seven-and-twenty, with every beauty except bloom, and with manners as
consciously right as they were invariably gentle; and twelve years had
transformed the fine-looking, well-grown Miss Hamilton, in all the glow
of health and confidence of superiority, into a poor, infirm, helpless
widow, receiving the visit of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) former protegee as a favour; but all
that was uncomfortable in the meeting had soon passed away, and left
only the interesting charm of remembering former partialities and
talking over old times.

<p/>Anne found in Mrs Smith the good sense and agreeable manners which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had almost ventured to depend on, and a disposition to converse and be
cheerful beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expectation.  Neither the dissipations of the
past--and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had lived very much in the world--nor the restrictions of
the present, neither sickness nor sorrow seemed to have closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
heart or ruined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits.

<p/>In the course of a second visit she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) talked with great openness, and
Anne's astonishment increased.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could scarcely imagine a more
cheerless situation in itself than Mrs Smith's.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been very fond
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband:  she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had buried him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been used to affluence:
it was gone.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no child to connect her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with life and happiness
again, no relations to assist in the arrangement of perplexed affairs,
no health to make all the rest supportable.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) accommodations were
limited to a noisy parlour, and a dark bedroom behind, with no
possibility of moving from one to the other without assistance, which
there was only one servant in the house to afford, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) never
quitted the house but to be conveyed into the warm bath.  Yet, in spite
of all this, Anne had reason to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had moments only of
languor and depression, to hours of occupation and enjoyment.  How
could it be?  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) watched, observed, reflected, and finally determined
that this was not a case of fortitude or of resignation only.  A
submissive spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply
resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of
mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily
from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out of
herself, which was from nature alone.  It was the choicest gift of
Heaven; and Anne viewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend as one of those instances in which,
by a merciful appointment, it seems designed to counterbalance almost
every other want.

<p/>There had been a time, Mrs Smith told her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), when her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spirits had nearly
failed.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not call herself an invalid now, compared with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
state on first reaching Bath.  Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had, indeed, been a pitiable
object; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had caught cold on the journey, and had hardly taken
possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) lodgings before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was again confined to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) bed and
suffering under severe and constant pain; and all this among strangers,
with the absolute necessity of having a regular nurse, and finances at
that moment particularly unfit to meet any extraordinary expense.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
had weathered it, however, and could truly say that it had done her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
good.  It had increased her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) comforts by making her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) feel herself to be
in good hands.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had seen too much of the world, to expect sudden or
disinterested attachment anywhere, but her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) illness had proved to her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
that her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) landlady had a character to preserve, and would not use her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>)
ill; and she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) had been particularly fortunate in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) nurse, as a sister
of her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) landlady, a nurse by profession, and who had always a home in
that house when unemployed, chanced to be at liberty just in time to
attend her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">"And she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, "besides nursing me most
admirably, has really proved an invaluable acquaintance.  As soon as I
could use my hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) taught me to knit, which has been a great
amusement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) put me in the way of making these little
thread-cases, pin-cushions and card-racks, which you always find me so
busy about, and which supply me with the means of doing a little good
to one or two very poor families in this neighbourhood.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had a
large acquaintance, of course professionally, among those who can
afford to buy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) disposes of my merchandise.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) always takes
the right time for applying.  Everybody's heart is open, you know, when
they have recently escaped from severe pain, or are recovering the
blessing of health, and Nurse Rooke thoroughly understands when to
speak.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) is a shrewd, intelligent, sensible woman.  Hers is a line
for seeing human nature; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) has a fund of good sense and
observation, which, as a companion, make her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) infinitely superior to
thousands of those who having only received 'the best education in the
world,' know nothing worth attending to.  Call it gossip, if you will,
but when Nurse Rooke has half an hour's leisure to bestow on me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) is
sure to have something to relate that is entertaining and profitable:
something that makes one know one's species better.  One likes to hear
what is going on, to be au fait as to the newest modes of being
trifling and silly.  To me, who live so much alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Nurse</b></font>) conversation, I
assure you, is a treat."

<p/>Anne, far from wishing to cavil at the pleasure, replied, "I can easily
believe it.  Women of that class have great opportunities, and if they
are intelligent may be well worth listening to.  Such varieties of
human nature as they are in the habit of witnessing!  And it is not
merely in its follies, that they are well read; for they see it
occasionally under every circumstance that can be most interesting or
affecting.  What instances must pass before them of ardent,
disinterested, self-denying attachment, of heroism, fortitude,
patience, resignation:  of all the conflicts and all the sacrifices
that ennoble us most.  A sick chamber may often furnish the worth of
volumes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith more doubtingly, "sometimes it may, though I fear
its lessons are not often in the elevated style you describe.  Here and
there, human nature may be great in times of trial; but generally
speaking, it is its weakness and not its strength that appears in a
sick chamber:  it is selfishness and impatience rather than generosity
and fortitude, that one hears of.  There is so little real friendship
in the world! and unfortunately" (speaking low and tremulously) "there
are so many who forget to think seriously till it is almost too late."

<p/>Anne saw the misery of such feelings.  The husband had not been what he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
ought, and the wife had been led among that part of mankind which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) think worse of the world than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hoped it deserved.  It was but a
passing emotion however with Mrs Smith; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) shook it off, and soon
added in a different tone--

<p/>"I do not suppose the situation my friend Mrs Rooke is in at present,
will furnish much either to interest or edify me.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) is only nursing
Mrs Wallis of Marlborough Buildings; a mere pretty, silly, expensive,
fashionable woman, I believe; and of course will have nothing to report
but of lace and finery.  I mean to make my profit of Mrs Wallis,
however.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) has plenty of money, and I intend she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) shall buy all the
high-priced things I have in hand now."

<p/>Anne had called several times on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, before the existence of
such a person was known in Camden Place.  At last, it became necessary
to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>). Sir Walter, Elizabeth and Mrs Clay, returned one
morning from Laura Place, with a sudden invitation from Lady Dalrymple
for the same evening, and Anne was already engaged, to spend that
evening in Westgate Buildings.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not sorry for the excuse.  They
were only asked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sure, because Lady Dalrymple being kept at
home by a bad cold, was glad to make use of the relationship which had
been so pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) declined on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) own account with great
alacrity--<div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) was engaged to spend the evening with an old
schoolfellow."   (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>They were not much interested in anything relative to
Anne; but still there were questions enough asked, to make it
understood what this old schoolfellow was; and Elizabeth was
disdainful, and Sir Walter severe.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Westgate Buildings!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), "and who is Miss Anne Elliot to be
visiting in Westgate Buildings?  A Mrs Smith.  A widow Mrs Smith; and
who was her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband?  One of five thousand Mr Smiths whose names are to
be met with everywhere.  And what is her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) attraction?  That she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is old
and sickly.  Upon my word, Miss Anne Elliot, you have the most
extraordinary taste!  Everything that revolts other people, low
company, paltry rooms, foul air, disgusting associations are inviting
to you.  But surely you may put off this old lady till to-morrow:  she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
is not so near her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) end, I presume, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may hope to see another
day.  What is her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) age?  Forty?"

<p/>"No, sir, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is not one-and-thirty; but I do not think I can put off
my engagement, because it is the only evening for some time which will
at once suit her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) and myself.  She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) goes into the warm bath to-morrow,
and for the rest of the week, you know, we are engaged."

<p/>"But what does Lady Russell think of this acquaintance?<div class="bookquote">" asked
Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sees nothing to blame in it," replied Anne; "on the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
approves it, and has generally taken me when I have called on Mrs
Smith."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Westgate Buildings must have been rather surprised by the appearance
of a carriage drawn up near its pavement,"  (<font color='red'><b>Walter</b></font>)</div>observed Sir Walter.  "Sir
Henry Russell's widow, indeed, has no honours to distinguish her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) arms,
but still it is a handsome equipage, and no doubt is well known to
convey a Miss Elliot.  A widow Mrs Smith lodging in Westgate Buildings!
A poor widow barely able to live, between thirty and forty; a mere Mrs
Smith, an every-day Mrs Smith, of all people and all names in the
world, to be the chosen friend of Miss Anne Elliot, and to be preferred
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own family connections among the nobility of England and
Ireland!  Mrs Smith!  Such a name!"

<p/>Mrs Clay, who had been present while all this passed, now thought it
advisable to leave the room, and Anne could have said much, and did
long to say a little in defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's not very dissimilar
claims to theirs, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sense of personal respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) made no reply.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) left it to himself to
recollect, that Mrs Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty
and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.

<p/>Anne kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) appointment; the others kept theirs, and of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
heard the next morning that they had had a delightful evening.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
been the only one of the set absent, for Sir Walter and Elizabeth had
not only been quite at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship's service themselves, but had
actually been happy to be employed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in collecting others, and had
been at the trouble of inviting both Lady Russell and Mr Elliot; and Mr
Elliot had made a point of leaving Colonel Wallis early, and Lady
Russell had fresh arranged all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) evening engagements in order to wait
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).  Anne had the whole history of all that such an evening could
supply from Lady Russell.  To her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), its greatest interest must be, in
having been very much talked of between her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) friend and Mr Elliot; in
having been wished for, regretted, and at the same time honoured for
staying away in such a cause.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) kind, compassionate visits to this
old schoolfellow, sick and reduced, seemed to have quite delighted Mr
Elliot.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) a most extraordinary young woman; in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
temper, manners, mind, a model of female excellence.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could meet
even Lady Russell in a discussion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) merits; and Anne could not be
given to understand so much by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, could not know herself to be
so highly rated by a sensible man, without many of those agreeable
sensations which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend meant to create.

<p/>Lady Russell was now perfectly decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) opinion of Mr Elliot.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was as much convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) meaning to gain Anne in time as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
deserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and was beginning to calculate the number of weeks which
would free him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) from all the remaining restraints of widowhood, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) at liberty to exert his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) most open powers of pleasing.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
would not speak to Anne with half the certainty she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt on the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would venture on little more than hints of what might be
hereafter, of a possible attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side, of the desirableness
of the alliance, supposing such attachment to be real and returned.
Anne heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and made no violent exclamations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only smiled,
blushed, and gently shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am no match-maker, as you well know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, "being much
too well aware of the uncertainty of all human events and calculations.
I only mean that if Mr Elliot should some time hence pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) addresses
to you, and if you should be disposed to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), I think there
would be every possibility of your being happy together.  A most
suitable connection everybody must consider it, but I think it might be
a very happy one."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr Elliot is an exceedingly agreeable man, and in many respects I
think highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne Elliot/Miss Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne; "but we should not suit."

<p/>Lady Russell let this pass, and only said in rejoinder, "I own that to
be able to regard you as the future mistress of Kellynch, the future
Lady Elliot, to look forward and see you occupying your dear mother's
place, succeeding to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) rights, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) popularity, as well as
to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) virtues, would be the highest possible gratification to me.
You are your mother's self in countenance and disposition; and if I
might be allowed to fancy you such as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, in situation and name,
and home, presiding and blessing in the same spot, and only superior to
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in being more highly valued!  My dearest Anne, it would give me
more delight than is often felt at my time of life!"

<p/>Anne was obliged to turn away, to rise, to walk to a distant table,
and, leaning there in pretended employment, try to subdue the feelings
this picture excited.  For a few moments her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) imagination and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart
were bewitched.  The idea of becoming what her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother had been; of
having the precious name of <div class="bookquote">"Lady Elliot"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>first revived in herself; of
being restored to Kellynch, calling it her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) home again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) home for
ever, was a charm which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not immediately resist.  Lady Russell
said not another word, willing to leave the matter to its own
operation; and believing that, could Mr Elliot at that moment with
propriety have spoken for himself!--she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) believed, in short, what Anne
did not believe.  The same image of Mr Elliot speaking for himself
brought Anne to composure again.  The charm of Kellynch and of <div class="bookquote">"Lady
Elliot"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>all faded away.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) never could accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  And it was not
only that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) feelings were still adverse to any man save one; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
judgement, on a serious consideration of the possibilities of such a
case was against Mr Elliot.

<p/>Though they had now been acquainted a month, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not be satisfied
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) really knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) character.  That he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was a sensible man, an
agreeable man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) talked well, professed good opinions, seemed to
judge properly and as a man of principle, this was all clear enough.
He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly knew what was right, nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) fix on any one article
of moral duty evidently transgressed; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would have been
afraid to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) conduct.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) distrusted the past, if not the
present.  The names which occasionally dropt of former associates, the
allusions to former practices and pursuits, suggested suspicions not
favourable of what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) saw that there had been bad
habits; that Sunday travelling had been a common thing; that there had
been a period of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life (and probably not a short one) when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had
been, at least, careless in all serious matters; and, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might
now think very differently, who could answer for the true sentiments of
a clever, cautious man, grown old enough to appreciate a fair
character?  How could it ever be ascertained that his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mind was truly
cleansed?

<p/>Mr Elliot was rational, discreet, polished, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not open.  There
was never any burst of feeling, any warmth of indignation or delight,
at the evil or good of others.  This, to Anne, was a decided
imperfection.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) early impressions were incurable.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) prized the
frank, the open-hearted, the eager character beyond all others.  Warmth
and enthusiasm did captivate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) still.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could so
much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or
said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind
never varied, whose tongue never slipped.

<p/>Mr Elliot was too generally agreeable.  Various as were the tempers in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) pleased them all.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) endured too well, stood
too well with every body.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with some degree of
openness of Mrs Clay; had appeared completely to see what Mrs Clay was
about, and to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) in contempt; and yet Mrs Clay found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as
agreeable as any body.

<p/>Lady Russell saw either less or more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) saw
nothing to excite distrust.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not imagine a man more exactly
what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be than Mr Elliot; nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ever enjoy a sweeter
feeling than the hope of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) receive the hand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) beloved
Anne in Kellynch church, in the course of the following autumn.
