<p/>Sir Thomas’s return made a striking change in the ways of the family,
independent of Lovers’ Vows. Under his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) government, Mansfield was an
altered place. Some members of their society sent away, and the spirits
of many others saddened—it was all sameness and gloom compared with the
past—a sombre family party rarely enlivened. There was little
intercourse with the Parsonage. Sir Thomas, drawing back from
intimacies in general, was particularly disinclined, at this time, for
any engagements but in one quarter. The Rushworths were the only
addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own domestic circle which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could solicit.

<p/>Edmund did not wonder that such should be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father’s feelings, nor
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) regret anything but the exclusion of the Grants. <div class="bookquote">"But they,"
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) observed to Fanny, "have a claim. They seem to belong to us; they
seem to be part of ourselves. I could wish my father were more sensible
of their very great attention to my mother and sisters while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
away. I am afraid they may feel themselves neglected. But the truth is,
that my father hardly knows them. They had not been here a twelvemonth
when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) left England. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) knew them better, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would value their
society as it deserves; for they are in fact exactly the sort of people
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would like. We are sometimes a little in want of animation among
ourselves: my sisters seem out of spirits, and Tom is certainly not at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) ease. Dr. and Mrs. Grant would enliven us, and make our evenings
pass away with more enjoyment even to my father."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do you think so?"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny: <div class="bookquote">"in my opinion, my uncle would not like
_any_ addition. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) values the very quietness you speak of, and
that the repose of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own family circle is all he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wants. And it does
not appear to me that we are more serious than we used to be—I mean
before my uncle went abroad. As well as I can recollect, it was always
much the same. There was never much laughing in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) presence; or, if
there is any difference, it is not more, I think, than such an absence
has a tendency to produce at first. There must be a sort of shyness;
but I cannot recollect that our evenings formerly were ever merry,
except when my uncle was in town. No young people’s are, I suppose,
when those they look up to are at home" (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>.

<p/>"I believe you are right, Fanny," was his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) reply, after a short
consideration. "I believe our evenings are rather returned to what they
were, than assuming a new character. The novelty was in their being
lively. Yet, how strong the impression that only a few weeks will give!
I have been feeling as if we had never lived so before."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suppose I am graver than other people,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny. "The evenings do
not appear long to me. I love to hear my uncle talk of the West Indies.
I could listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) for an hour together. It entertains _me_ more
than many other things have done; but then I am unlike other people, I
dare say."

<p/>"Why should you dare say _that_?<div class="bookquote">" (smiling). " (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>Do you want to be told
that you are only unlike other people in being more wise and discreet?
But when did you, or anybody, ever get a compliment from me, Fanny? Go
to my father if you want to be complimented. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will satisfy you. Ask
your uncle what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thinks, and you will hear compliments enough: and
though they may be chiefly on your person, you must put up with it, and
trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seeing as much beauty of mind in time.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Such language was so new to Fanny that it quite embarrassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>Your uncle thinks you very pretty, dear Fanny—and that is the long and
the short of the matter. Anybody but myself would have made something
more of it, and anybody but you would resent that you had not been
thought very pretty before; but the truth is, that your uncle never did
admire you till now—and now he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) does. Your complexion is so
improved!—and you have gained so much countenance!—and your figure—nay,
Fanny, do not turn away about it—it is but an uncle. If you cannot bear
an uncle’s admiration, what is to become of you? You must really begin
to harden yourself to the idea of being worth looking at. You must try
not to mind growing up into a pretty woman."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! don’t talk so, don’t talk so,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, distressed by more
feelings than he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was aware of; but seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was distressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
had done with the subject, and only added more seriously—

<p/>"Your uncle is disposed to be pleased with you in every respect; and I
only wish you would talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) more. You are one of those who are too
silent in the evening circle."

<p/>"But I do talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) more than I used. I am sure I do. Did not you
hear me ask him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) about the slave-trade last night?"

<p/>"I did—and was in hopes the question would be followed up by others. It
would have pleased your uncle to be inquired of farther."

<p/>"And I longed to do it—but there was such a dead silence! And while my
cousins were sitting by without speaking a word, or seeming at all
interested in the subject, I did not like—I thought it would appear as
if I wanted to set myself off at their expense, by shewing a curiosity
and pleasure in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) information which he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) must wish his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own daughters to
feel."

<p/>"Miss Crawford was very right in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said of you the other day:
that you seemed almost as fearful of notice and praise as other women
were of neglect. We were talking of you at the Parsonage, and those
were her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) words. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has great discernment. I know nobody who
distinguishes characters better. For so young a woman it is remarkable!
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) certainly understands _you_ better than you are understood by the
greater part of those who have known you so long; and with regard to
some others, I can perceive, from occasional lively hints, the
unguarded expressions of the moment, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could define _many_ as
accurately, did not delicacy forbid it. I wonder what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thinks of my
father! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must admire him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as a fine-looking man, with most
gentlemanlike, dignified, consistent manners; but perhaps, having seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so seldom, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reserve may be a little repulsive. Could they be
much together, I feel sure of their liking each other. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would enjoy
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) liveliness and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has talents to value his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) powers. I wish they met
more frequently! I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not suppose there is any dislike on
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must know herself too secure of the regard of all the rest of
you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, with half a sigh, "to have any such apprehension. And
Sir Thomas’s wishing just at first to be only with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, is so
very natural, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can argue nothing from that. After a little
while, I dare say, we shall be meeting again in the same sort of way,
allowing for the difference of the time of year."

<p/>"This is the first October that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has passed in the country since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
infancy. I do not call Tunbridge or Cheltenham the country; and
November is a still more serious month, and I can see that Mrs. Grant
is very anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) not finding Mansfield dull as winter comes on."

<p/>Fanny could have said a great deal, but it was safer to say nothing,
and leave untouched all Miss Crawford’s resources—her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) accomplishments,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) importance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friends, lest it should betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
into any observations seemingly unhandsome. Miss Crawford’s kind
opinion of herself deserved at least a grateful forbearance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
began to talk of something else.

<p/>"To-morrow, I think, my uncle dines at Sotherton, and you and Mr.
Bertram too. We shall be quite a small party at home. I hope my uncle
may continue to like Mr. Rushworth."

<p/>"That is impossible, Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) must like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) less after to-morrow’s
visit, for we shall be five hours in his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) company. I should dread the
stupidity of the day, if there were not a much greater evil to
follow—the impression it must leave on Sir Thomas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cannot much
longer deceive himself. I am sorry for them all, and would give
something that Rushworth and Maria had never met."

<p/>In this quarter, indeed, disappointment was impending over Sir Thomas.
Not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good-will for Mr. Rushworth, not all Mr. Rushworth’s
deference for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), could prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) from soon discerning some part of
the truth—that Mr. Rushworth was an inferior young man, as ignorant in
business as in books, with opinions in general unfixed, and without
seeming much aware of it himself.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had expected a very different son-in-law; and beginning to feel
grave on Maria’s account, tried to understand _her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)_ feelings. Little
observation there was necessary to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) that indifference was the
most favourable state they could be in. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) behaviour to Mr. Rushworth
was careless and cold. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could not, did not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). Sir Thomas
resolved to speak seriously to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Advantageous as would be the
alliance, and long standing and public as was the engagement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
happiness must not be sacrificed to it. Mr. Rushworth had, perhaps,
been accepted on too short an acquaintance, and, on knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) better,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was repenting.

<p/>With solemn kindness Sir Thomas addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>): told her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) fears,
inquired into her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) wishes, entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to be open and sincere, and
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that every inconvenience should be braved, and the
connexion entirely given up, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) felt herself unhappy in the
prospect of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would act for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) and release her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>). Maria had a
moment’s struggle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) listened, and only a moment’s: when her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) father
ceased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was able to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) answer immediately, decidedly, and
with no apparent agitation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) great attention,
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) paternal kindness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was quite mistaken in supposing she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
the smallest desire of breaking through her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) engagement, or was sensible
of any change of opinion or inclination since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) forming it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had
the highest esteem for Mr. Rushworth’s character and disposition, and
could not have a doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Thomas was satisfied; too glad to be satisfied, perhaps, to urge
the matter quite so far as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) judgment might have dictated to others.
It was an alliance which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not have relinquished without pain;
and thus he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) reasoned. Mr. Rushworth was young enough to improve. Mr.
Rushworth must and would improve in good society; and if Maria could
now speak so securely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) happiness with him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), speaking certainly
without the prejudice, the blindness of love, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) ought to be believed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feelings, probably, were not acute; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had never supposed them to
be so; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) comforts might not be less on that account; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
could dispense with seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) husband a leading, shining character,
there would certainly be everything else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) favour. A well-disposed
young woman, who did not marry for love, was in general but the more
attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own family; and the nearness of Sotherton to Mansfield
must naturally hold out the greatest temptation, and would, in all
probability, be a continual supply of the most amiable and innocent
enjoyments. Such and such-like were the reasonings of Sir Thomas, happy
to escape the embarrassing evils of a rupture, the wonder, the
reflections, the reproach that must attend it; happy to secure a
marriage which would bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) such an addition of respectability and
influence, and very happy to think anything of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter’s
disposition that was most favourable for the purpose.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the conference closed as satisfactorily as to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was in a
state of mind to be glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had secured her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) fate beyond recall:
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had pledged herself anew to Sotherton; that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was safe from
the possibility of giving Crawford the triumph of governing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
actions, and destroying her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) prospects; and retired in proud resolve,
determined only to behave more cautiously to Mr. Rushworth in future,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) father might not be again suspecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).

<p/>Had Sir Thomas applied to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter within the first three or four
days after Henry Crawford’s leaving Mansfield, before her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) feelings were
at all tranquillised, before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had given up every hope of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>), or
absolutely resolved on enduring his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) rival, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) answer might have been
different; but after another three or four days, when there was no
return, no letter, no message, no symptom of a softened heart, no hope
of advantage from separation, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind became cool enough to seek all
the comfort that pride and self revenge could give.

<p/>Henry Crawford had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) happiness, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had done it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not destroy her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) credit, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) appearance, her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
prosperity, too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should not have to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) as pining in the
retirement of Mansfield for _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_, rejecting Sotherton and London,
independence and splendour, for _his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ sake. Independence was more
needful than ever; the want of it at Mansfield more sensibly felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was less and less able to endure the restraint which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father
imposed. The liberty which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) absence had given was now become
absolutely necessary. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must escape from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Mansfield as soon as
possible, and find consolation in fortune and consequence, bustle and
the world, for a wounded spirit. Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mind was quite determined, and
varied not.

<p/>To such feelings delay, even the delay of much preparation, would have
been an evil, and Mr. Rushworth could hardly be more impatient for the
marriage than herself. In all the important preparations of the mind
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was complete: being prepared for matrimony by an hatred of home,
restraint, and tranquillity; by the misery of disappointed affection,
and contempt of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was to marry. The rest might wait. The
preparations of new carriages and furniture might wait for London and
spring, when her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own taste could have fairer play.

<p/>The principals being all agreed in this respect, it soon appeared that
a very few weeks would be sufficient for such arrangements as must
precede the wedding.

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth was quite ready to retire, and make way for the
fortunate young woman whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) dear son had selected; and very early in
November removed herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) maid, her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) footman, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) chariot, with
true dowager propriety, to Bath, there to parade over the wonders of
Sotherton in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) evening parties; enjoying them as thoroughly, perhaps,
in the animation of a card-table, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had ever done on the spot; and
before the middle of the same month the ceremony had taken place which
gave Sotherton another mistress.

<p/>It was a very proper wedding. The bride was elegantly dressed; the two
bridesmaids were duly inferior; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) father gave her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) away; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) mother
stood with salts in her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) hand, expecting to be agitated; her (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) aunt tried
to cry; and the service was impressively read by Dr. Grant. Nothing
could be objected to when it came under the discussion of the
neighbourhood, except that the carriage which conveyed the bride and
bridegroom and Julia from the church-door to Sotherton was the same
chaise which Mr. Rushworth had used for a twelvemonth before. In
everything else the etiquette of the day might stand the strictest
investigation.

<p/>It was done, and they were gone. Sir Thomas felt as an anxious father
must feel, and was indeed experiencing much of the agitation which his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
wife had been apprehensive of for herself, but had fortunately escaped.
Mrs. Norris, most happy to assist in the duties of the day, by spending
it at the Park to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister’s spirits, and drinking the health
of Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth in a supernumerary glass or two, was all
joyous delight; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had made the match; she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had done everything;
and no one would have supposed, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) confident triumph, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
had ever heard of conjugal infelicity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) life, or could have the
smallest insight into the disposition of the niece who had been brought
up under her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eye.

<p/>The plan of the young couple was to proceed, after a few days, to
Brighton, and take a house there for some weeks. Every public place was
new to Maria, and Brighton is almost as gay in winter as in summer.
When the novelty of amusement there was over, it would be time for the
wider range of London.

<p/>Julia was to go with them to Brighton. Since rivalry between the
sisters had ceased, they had been gradually recovering much of their
former good understanding; and were at least sufficiently friends to
make each of them exceedingly glad to be with the other at such a time.
Some other companion than Mr. Rushworth was of the first consequence to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) lady; and Julia was quite as eager for novelty and pleasure as
Maria, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might not have struggled through so much to obtain
them, and could better bear a subordinate situation.

<p/>Their departure made another material change at Mansfield, a chasm
which required some time to fill up. The family circle became greatly
contracted; and though the Miss Bertrams had latterly added little to
its gaiety, they could not but be missed. Even their mother missed
them; and how much more their tenderhearted cousin, who wandered about
the house, and thought of them, and felt for them, with a degree of
affectionate regret which they had never done much to deserve!
