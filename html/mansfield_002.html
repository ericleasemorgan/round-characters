<p/>The little girl performed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) long journey in safety; and at
Northampton was met by Mrs. Norris, who thus regaled in the credit of
being foremost to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), and in the importance of leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) in
to the others, and recommending her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to their kindness.

<p/>Fanny Price was at this time just ten years old, and though there might
not be much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first appearance to captivate, there was, at least,
nothing to disgust her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was small of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) age, with no
glow of complexion, nor any other striking beauty; exceedingly timid
and shy, and shrinking from notice; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) air, though awkward, was
not vulgar, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) voice was sweet, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance was
pretty. Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram received her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) very kindly; and Sir
Thomas, seeing how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) needed encouragement, tried to be all that
was conciliating: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had to work against a most untoward gravity of
deportment; and Lady Bertram, without taking half so much trouble, or
speaking one word where he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spoke ten, by the mere aid of a
good-humoured smile, became immediately the less awful character of the
two.

<p/>The young people were all at home, and sustained their share in the
introduction very well, with much good humour, and no embarrassment, at
least on the part of the sons, who, at seventeen and sixteen, and tall
of their age, had all the grandeur of men in the eyes of their little
cousin. The two girls were more at a loss from being younger and in
greater awe of their father, who addressed them on the occasion with
rather an injudicious particularity. But they were too much used to
company and praise to have anything like natural shyness; and their
confidence increasing from their cousin’s total want of it, they were
soon able to take a full survey of her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) face and her (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) frock in easy
indifference.

<p/>They were a remarkably fine family, the sons very well-looking, the
daughters decidedly handsome, and all of them well-grown and forward of
their age, which produced as striking a difference between the cousins
in person, as education had given to their address; and no one would
have supposed the girls so nearly of an age as they really were. There
were in fact but two years between the youngest and Fanny. Julia
Bertram was only twelve, and Maria but a year older. The little visitor
meanwhile was as unhappy as possible. Afraid of everybody, ashamed of
herself, and longing for the home she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had left, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew not how to
look up, and could scarcely speak to be heard, or without crying. Mrs.
Norris had been talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) the whole way from Northampton of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
wonderful good fortune, and the extraordinary degree of gratitude and
good behaviour which it ought to produce, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) consciousness of
misery was therefore increased by the idea of its being a wicked thing
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) not to be happy. The fatigue, too, of so long a journey, became
soon no trifling evil. In vain were the well-meant condescensions of
Sir Thomas, and all the officious prognostications of Mrs. Norris that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) would be a good girl; in vain did Lady Bertram smile and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
sit on the sofa with herself and pug, and vain was even the sight of a
gooseberry tart towards giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) comfort; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could scarcely swallow
two mouthfuls before tears interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), and sleep seeming to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
likeliest friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was taken to finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sorrows in bed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is not a very promising beginning,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, when Fanny
had left the room. "After all that I said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as we came along, I
thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have behaved better; I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) how much might depend
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acquitting herself well at first. I wish there may not be a
little sulkiness of temper—her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor mother had a good deal; but we must
make allowances for such a child—and I do not know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being sorry
to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home is really against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), for, with all its faults, it
_was_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cannot as yet understand how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has
changed for the better; but then there is moderation in all things."

<p/>It required a longer time, however, than Mrs. Norris was inclined to
allow, to reconcile Fanny to the novelty of Mansfield Park, and the
separation from everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings were very
acute, and too little understood to be properly attended to. Nobody
meant to be unkind, but nobody put themselves out of their way to
secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comfort.

<p/>The holiday allowed to the Miss Bertrams the next day, on purpose to
afford leisure for getting acquainted with, and entertaining their
young cousin, produced little union. They could not but hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheap
on finding that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had but two sashes, and had never learned French;
and when they perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be little struck with the duet they were
so good as to play, they could do no more than make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a generous
present of some of their least valued toys, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to herself,
while they adjourned to whatever might be the favourite holiday sport
of the moment, making artificial flowers or wasting gold paper.

<p/>Fanny, whether near or from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins, whether in the schoolroom, the
drawing-room, or the shrubbery, was equally forlorn, finding something
to fear in every person and place. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was disheartened by Lady
Bertram’s silence, awed by Sir Thomas’s grave looks, and quite overcome
by Mrs. Norris’s admonitions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) elder cousins mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) by
reflections on her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) size, and abashed her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) by noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) shyness: Miss
Lee wondered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) ignorance, and the maid-servants sneered at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)
clothes; and when to these sorrows was added the idea of the brothers
and sisters among whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) had always been important as playfellow,
instructress, and nurse, the despondence that sunk her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) little heart was
severe.

<p/>The grandeur of the house astonished, but could not console her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>). The
rooms were too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to move in with ease: whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) touched
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) expected to injure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) crept about in constant terror of
something or other; often retreating towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) own chamber to cry;
and the little girl who was spoken of in the drawing-room when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) left
it at night as seeming so desirably sensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) peculiar good
fortune, ended every day’s sorrows by sobbing herself to sleep. A week
had passed in this way, and no suspicion of it conveyed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) quiet
passive manner, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) was found one morning by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) cousin Edmund,
the youngest of the sons, sitting crying on the attic stairs.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear little cousin,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), with all the gentleness of an
excellent nature, "what can be the matter?" And sitting down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
was at great pains to overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) shame in being so surprised, and
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) to speak openly. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) ill? or was anybody angry with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)? or had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) quarrelled with Maria and Julia? or was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) puzzled
about anything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) lesson that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could explain? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), in short,
want anything he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could possibly get her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>), or do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>)? For a long
while no answer could be obtained beyond a <div class="bookquote">"no, no—not at all—no, thank
you" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) still persevered; and no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) begun to revert to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) own home, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) increased sobs explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) where the
grievance lay. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are sorry to leave Mama, my dear little Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), "which
shows you to be a very good girl; but you must remember that you are
with relations and friends, who all love you, and wish to make you
happy. Let us walk out in the park, and you shall tell me all about
your brothers and sisters."

<p/>On pursuing the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) found that, dear as all these brothers and
sisters generally were, there was one among them who ran more in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
thoughts than the rest. It was William whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) talked of most, and
wanted most to see. William, the eldest, a year older than herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
constant companion and friend; her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advocate with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother (of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)
was the darling) in every distress. <div class="bookquote">"William did not like she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should
come away; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should miss her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) very much indeed."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"But
William will write to you, I dare say."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had promised he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had told _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ to write first."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"And when shall you do it?"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
hung her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) head and answered hesitatingly, "she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) did not know; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not
any paper."

<p/>"If that be all your difficulty, I will furnish you with paper and
every other material, and you may write your letter whenever you
choose. Would it make you happy to write to William?"

<p/>"Yes, very."

<p/>"Then let it be done now. Come with me into the breakfast-room, we
shall find everything there, and be sure of having the room to
ourselves."

<p/>"But, cousin, will it go to the post?"

<p/>"Yes, depend upon me it shall: it shall go with the other letters; and,
as your uncle will frank it, it will cost William nothing."

<p/>"My uncle!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Fanny, with a frightened look.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes, when you have written the letter, I will take it to my father to
frank."

<p/>Fanny thought it a bold measure, but offered no further resistance; and
they went together into the breakfast-room, where Edmund prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
paper, and ruled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lines with all the goodwill that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother could
himself have felt, and probably with somewhat more exactness. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
continued with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the whole time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) writing, to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) penknife or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) orthography, as either were wanted; and added to
these attentions, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt very much, a kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother
which delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) beyond all the rest. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wrote with his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own hand his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
love to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) cousin William, and sent him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) half a guinea under the seal.
Fanny’s feelings on the occasion were such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed herself
incapable of expressing; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance and a few artless words
fully conveyed all their gratitude and delight, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin began to
find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an interesting object. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more, and, from all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, was convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having an affectionate heart, and a
strong desire of doing right; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) could perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be farther
entitled to attention by great sensibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation, and great
timidity. He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had never knowingly given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pain, but he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) now felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) required more positive kindness; and with that view endeavoured, in
the first place, to lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fears of them all, and gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
especially a great deal of good advice as to playing with Maria and
Julia, and being as merry as possible.

<p/>From this day Fanny grew more comfortable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a
friend, and the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) better spirits
with everybody else. The place became less strange, and the people less
formidable; and if there were some amongst them whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
cease to fear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began at least to know their ways, and to catch the
best manner of conforming to them. The little rusticities and
awkwardnesses which had at first made grievous inroads on the
tranquillity of all, and not least of herself, necessarily wore away,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was no longer materially afraid to appear before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, nor
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris’s voice make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) start very much. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) became occasionally an acceptable companion. Though unworthy, from
inferiority of age and strength, to be their constant associate, their
pleasures and schemes were sometimes of a nature to make a third very
useful, especially when that third was of an obliging, yielding temper;
and they could not but own, when their aunt inquired into her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) faults,
or their brother Edmund urged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) claims to their kindness, that <div class="bookquote">"Fanny
was good-natured enough."

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div><p/>Edmund was uniformly kind himself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing worse to endure
on the part of Tom than that sort of merriment which a young man of
seventeen will always think fair with a child of ten. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was just
entering into life, full of spirits, and with all the liberal
dispositions of an eldest son, who feels born only for expense and
enjoyment. His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) kindness to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) little cousin was consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
situation and rights: he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) some very pretty presents, and
laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>As her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appearance and spirits improved, Sir Thomas and Mrs. Norris
thought with greater satisfaction of their benevolent plan; and it was
pretty soon decided between them that, though far from clever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
showed a tractable disposition, and seemed likely to give them little
trouble. A mean opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) abilities was not confined to _them_.
Fanny could read, work, and write, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been taught nothing
more; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ignorant of many things with which
they had been long familiar, they thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prodigiously stupid, and
for the first two or three weeks were continually bringing some fresh
report of it into the drawing-room. "Dear mama, only think, my cousin
cannot put the map of Europe together—or my cousin cannot tell the
principal rivers in Russia—or, she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) never heard of Asia Minor—or she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>)
does not know the difference between water-colours and crayons!—How
strange!—Did you ever hear anything so stupid?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>their considerate aunt would reply, "it is very bad, but you
must not expect everybody to be as forward and quick at learning as
yourself."

<p/>"But, aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is really so very ignorant!—Do you know, we asked her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
last night which way she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would go to get to Ireland; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
should cross to the Isle of Wight. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) thinks of nothing but the Isle
of Wight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) calls it _the_ _Island_, as if there were no other
island in the world. I am sure I should have been ashamed of myself, if
I had not known better long before I was so old as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is. I cannot
remember the time when I did not know a great deal that she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has not the
least notion of yet. How long ago it is, aunt, since we used to repeat
the chronological order of the kings of England, with the dates of
their accession, and most of the principal events of their reigns!"

<p/>"Yes,<div class="bookquote">" added the other; " (<font color='red'><b>the emperors</b></font>)</div>and of the Roman emperors as low as Severus;
besides a great deal of the heathen mythology, and all the metals,
semi-metals, planets, and distinguished philosophers."

<p/>"Very true indeed, my dears, but you are blessed with wonderful
memories, and your poor cousin has probably none at all. There is a
vast deal of difference in memories, as well as in everything else, and
therefore you must make allowance for your cousin, and pity her (<font color='blue'><b>emperors</b></font>)
deficiency. And remember that, if you are ever so forward and clever
yourselves, you should always be modest; for, much as you know already,
there is a great deal more for you to learn."

<p/>"Yes, I know there is, till I am seventeen. But I must tell you another
thing of Fanny, so odd and so stupid. Do you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does
not want to learn either music or drawing."

<p/>"To be sure, my dear, that is very stupid indeed, and shows a great
want of genius and emulation. But, all things considered, I do not know
whether it is not as well that it should be so, for, though you know
(owing to me) your papa and mama are so good as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) up with
you, it is not at all necessary that she (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) should be as accomplished as
you are;—on the contrary, it is much more desirable that there should
be a difference.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Such were the counsels by which Mrs. Norris assisted to form her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
nieces’ minds; and it is not very wonderful that, with all their
promising talents and early information, they should be entirely
deficient in the less common acquirements of self-knowledge, generosity
and humility. In everything but disposition they were admirably taught.
Sir Thomas did not know what was wanting, because, though a truly
anxious father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was not outwardly affectionate, and the reserve of
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manner repressed all the flow of their spirits before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).

<p/>To the education of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) daughters Lady Bertram paid not the smallest
attention. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had not time for such cares. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was a woman who spent
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) days in sitting, nicely dressed, on a sofa, doing some long piece
of needlework, of little use and no beauty, thinking more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) pug
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children, but very indulgent to the latter when it did not put
herself to inconvenience, guided in everything important by Sir Thomas,
and in smaller concerns by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) possessed greater
leisure for the service of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) girls, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would probably have supposed
it unnecessary, for they were under the care of a governess, with
proper masters, and could want nothing more. As for Fanny’s being
stupid at learning, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could only say it was very unlucky, but some
people _were_ stupid, and Fanny must take more pains: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know
what else was to be done; and, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being so dull, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must add
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw no harm in the poor little thing, and always found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very
handy and quick in carrying messages, and fetching what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted."

<p/>Fanny, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) faults of ignorance and timidity, was fixed at
Mansfield Park, and learning to transfer in its favour much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) former home, grew up there not unhappily among her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousins. There was no positive ill-nature in Maria or Julia; and though
Fanny was often mortified by their treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought too
lowly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own claims to feel injured by it.

<p/>From about the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) entering the family, Lady Bertram, in
consequence of a little ill-health, and a great deal of indolence, gave
up the house in town, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to occupy every spring,
and remained wholly in the country, leaving Sir Thomas to attend his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
duty in Parliament, with whatever increase or diminution of comfort
might arise from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence. In the country, therefore, the Miss
Bertrams continued to exercise their memories, practise their duets,
and grow tall and womanly: and their father saw them becoming in
person, manner, and accomplishments, everything that could satisfy his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
anxiety. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eldest son was careless and extravagant, and had already
given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) much uneasiness; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) other children promised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nothing
but good. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughters, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) felt, while they retained the name of
Bertram, must be giving it new grace, and in quitting it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trusted,
would extend its respectable alliances; and the character of Edmund,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) strong good sense and uprightness of mind, bid most fairly for
utility, honour, and happiness to himself and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) connexions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was to be a clergyman.

<p/>Amid the cares and the complacency which his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own children suggested,
Sir Thomas did not forget to do what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could for the children of Mrs.
Price: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) liberally in the education and disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
sons as they became old enough for a determinate pursuit; and Fanny,
though almost totally separated from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, was sensible of the
truest satisfaction in hearing of any kindness towards them, or of
anything at all promising in their situation or conduct. Once, and once
only, in the course of many years, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the happiness of being with
William. Of the rest she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw nothing: nobody seemed to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
ever going amongst them again, even for a visit, nobody at home seemed
to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but William determining, soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) removal, to be a
sailor, was invited to spend a week with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister in Northamptonshire
before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) went to sea. Their eager affection in meeting, their
exquisite delight in being together, their hours of happy mirth, and
moments of serious conference, may be imagined; as well as the sanguine
views and spirits of the boy even to the last, and the misery of the
girl when he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Luckily the visit happened in the Christmas
holidays, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could directly look for comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cousin
Edmund; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) such charming things of what William was to do,
and be hereafter, in consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) profession, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
gradually admit that the separation might have some use. Edmund’s
friendship never failed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>): his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) leaving Eton for Oxford made no change
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kind dispositions, and only afforded more frequent opportunities
of proving them. Without any display of doing more than the rest, or
any fear of doing too much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was always true to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) interests, and
considerate of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) feelings, trying to make her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) good qualities
understood, and to conquer the diffidence which prevented their being
more apparent; giving her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) advice, consolation, and encouragement.

<p/>Kept back as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was by everybody else, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) single support could not
bring her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) forward; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions were otherwise of the highest
importance in assisting the improvement of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mind, and extending its
pleasures. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be clever, to have a quick apprehension as
well as good sense, and a fondness for reading, which, properly
directed, must be an education in itself. Miss Lee taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) French,
and heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) read the daily portion of history; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) recommended the
books which charmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) leisure hours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) taste, and
corrected her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) judgment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) made reading useful by talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) read, and heightened its attraction by judicious praise. In
return for such services she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) better than anybody in the world
except William: her (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) heart was divided between the two.
