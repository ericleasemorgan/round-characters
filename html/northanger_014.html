<p/>Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, and Saturday have now
passed in review before the reader; the events of each day, its hopes
and fears, mortifications and pleasures, have been separately stated,
and the pangs of Sunday only now remain to be described, and close the
week. The Clifton scheme had been deferred, not relinquished, and on
the afternoon’s Crescent of this day, it was brought forward again. In
a private consultation between Isabella and James, the former of whom
had particularly set her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart upon going, and the latter no less
anxiously placed his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) upon pleasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), it was agreed that, provided
the weather were fair, the party should take place on the following
morning; and they were to set off very early, in order to be at home in
good time. The affair thus determined, and Thorpe’s approbation
secured, Catherine only remained to be apprised of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had left
them for a few minutes to speak to Miss Tilney. In that interval the
plan was completed, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) came again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) agreement was
demanded; but instead of the gay acquiescence expected by Isabella,
Catherine looked grave, was very sorry, but could not go. The
engagement which ought to have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from joining in the former
attempt would make it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to accompany them now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had
that moment settled with Miss Tilney to take their proposed walk
tomorrow; it was quite determined, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would not, upon any account,
retract. But that she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) _must_ and _should_ retract, was instantly the
eager cry of both the Thorpes; they must go to Clifton tomorrow, they
would not go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), it would be nothing to put off a mere walk
for one day longer, and they would not hear of a refusal. Catherine was
distressed, but not subdued. "Do not urge me, Isabella. I am engaged to
Miss Tilney. I cannot go." This availed nothing. The same arguments
assailed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) again; she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) should go, and they would not hear
of a refusal. <div class="bookquote">"It would be so easy to tell Miss Tilney that you had
just been reminded of a prior engagement, and must only beg to put off
the walk till Tuesday."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, it would not be easy. I could not do it. There has been no prior
engagement." But Isabella became only more and more urgent, calling on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in the most affectionate manner, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) by the most
endearing names. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dearest, sweetest Catherine would not
seriously refuse such a trifling request to a friend who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) so
dearly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beloved Catherine to have so feeling a heart, so
sweet a temper, to be so easily persuaded by those she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loved. But all
in vain; Catherine felt herself to be in the right, and though pained
by such tender, such flattering supplication, could not allow it to
influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). Isabella then tried another method. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) reproached her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
with having more affection for Miss Tilney, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) so
little a while, than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) best and oldest friends, with being grown
cold and indifferent, in short, towards herself. "I cannot help being
jealous, Catherine, when I see myself slighted for strangers, I, who
love you so excessively! When once my affections are placed, it is not
in the power of anything to change them. But I believe my feelings are
stronger than anybody’s; I am sure they are too strong for my own
peace; and to see myself supplanted in your friendship by strangers
does cut me to the quick, I own. These Tilneys seem to swallow up
everything else."

<p/>Catherine thought this reproach equally strange and unkind. Was it the
part of a friend thus to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings to the notice of others?
Isabella appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) ungenerous and selfish, regardless of
everything but her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own gratification. These painful ideas crossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
mind, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) said nothing. Isabella, in the meanwhile, had applied
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) handkerchief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes; and Morland, miserable at such a sight,
could not help saying, "Nay, Catherine. I think you cannot stand out
any longer now. The sacrifice is not much; and to oblige such a
friend—I shall think you quite unkind, if you still refuse."

<p/>This was the first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother’s openly siding against her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and
anxious to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) displeasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) proposed a compromise. If they
would only put off their scheme till Tuesday, which they might easily
do, as it depended only on themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could go with them, and
everybody might then be satisfied. But <div class="bookquote">"No, no, no!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the immediate
answer; <div class="bookquote">"that could not be, for Thorpe did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might not
go to town on Tuesday."  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>Catherine was sorry, but could do no more; and
a short silence ensued, which was broken by Isabella, who in a voice of
cold resentment said, "Very well, then there is an end of the party. If
Catherine does not go, I cannot. I cannot be the only woman. I would
not, upon any account in the world, do so improper a thing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Catherine, you must go,"  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>said James.

<p/>"But why cannot Mr. Thorpe drive one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) other sisters? I dare say
either of them would like to go."

<p/>"Thank ye,<div class="bookquote">" cried Thorpe, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but I did not come to Bath to drive my
sisters about, and look like a fool. No, if you do not go, d—— me if I
do. I only go for the sake of driving you."

<p/>"That is a compliment which gives me no pleasure." But her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) words were
lost on Thorpe, who had turned abruptly away.

<p/>The three others still continued together, walking in a most
uncomfortable manner to poor Catherine; sometimes not a word was said,
sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was again attacked with supplications or reproaches, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm was still linked within Isabella’s, though their hearts were at
war. At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was softened, at another irritated; always
distressed, but always steady.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I did not think you had been so obstinate, Catherine,"  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>said James;
<div class="bookquote">"you were not used to be so hard to persuade; you once were the
kindest, best-tempered of my sisters."

 (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope I am not less so now,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) replied, very feelingly; "but indeed
I cannot go. If I am wrong, I am doing what I believe to be right."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suspect,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, in a low voice, "there is no great
struggle."

<p/>Catherine’s heart swelled; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm, and Isabella made no
opposition. Thus passed a long ten minutes, till they were again joined
by Thorpe, who, coming to them with a gayer look, said, "Well, I have
settled the matter, and now we may all go tomorrow with a safe
conscience. I have been to Miss Tilney, and made your excuses."

<p/>"You have not!<div class="bookquote">" cried Catherine.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have, upon my soul. Left her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) this moment. Told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) you had sent me
to say that, having just recollected a prior engagement of going to
Clifton with us tomorrow, you could not have the pleasure of walking
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) till Tuesday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said very well, Tuesday was just as
convenient to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); so there is an end of all our difficulties. A pretty
good thought of mine—hey?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Isabella’s countenance was once more all smiles and good humour, and
James too looked happy again.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A most heavenly thought indeed! Now, my sweet Catherine, all our
distresses are over; you are honourably acquitted, and we shall have a
most delightful party."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This will not do,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; "I cannot submit to this. I must
run after Miss Tilney directly and set her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) right."

<p/>Isabella, however, caught hold of one hand, Thorpe of the other, and
remonstrances poured in from all three. Even James was quite angry.
When everything was settled, when Miss Tilney herself said that Tuesday
would suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) as well, it was quite ridiculous, quite absurd, to make
any further objection.

<p/>"I do not care. Mr. Thorpe had no business to invent any such message.
If I had thought it right to put it off, I could have spoken to Miss
Tilney myself. This is only doing it in a ruder way; and how do I know
that Mr. Thorpe has—He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) may be mistaken again perhaps; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) led me into
one act of rudeness by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mistake on Friday. Let me go, Mr. Thorpe;
Isabella, do not hold me.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Thorpe told her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) it would be in vain to go after the Tilneys; they were
turning the corner into Brock Street, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>) had overtaken them, and
were at home by this time.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Then I will go after them," said Catherine; "wherever they are I will
go after them. It does not signify talking. If I could not be persuaded
into doing what I thought wrong, I never will be tricked into it." And
with these words she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) broke away and hurried off. Thorpe would have
darted after her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), but Morland withheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Brock</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) go, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) go, if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) will go."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) is as obstinate as—"

<p/>Thorpe never finished the simile, for it could hardly have been a
proper one.

<p/>Away walked Catherine in great agitation, as fast as the crowd would
permit her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), fearful of being pursued, yet determined to persevere. As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walked, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reflected on what had passed. It was painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to
disappoint and displease them, particularly to displease her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resistance. Setting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own inclination
apart, to have failed a second time in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) engagement to Miss Tilney,
to have retracted a promise voluntarily made only five minutes before,
and on a false pretence too, must have been wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not been
withstanding them on selfish principles alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not consulted
merely her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own gratification; _that_ might have been ensured in some
degree by the excursion itself, by seeing Blaize Castle; no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had
attended to what was due to others, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own character in their
opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) conviction of being right, however, was not enough to
restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) composure; till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had spoken to Miss Tilney she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could not
be at ease; and quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pace when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) got clear of the Crescent,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) almost ran over the remaining ground till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) gained the top of
Milsom Street. So rapid had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) movements that in spite of the
Tilneys’ advantage in the outset, they were but just turning into their
lodgings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) came within view of them; and the servant still
remaining at the open door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) used only the ceremony of saying that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) must speak with Miss Tilney that moment, and hurrying by him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
proceeded upstairs. Then, opening the first door before her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), which
happened to be the right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) immediately found herself in the
drawing-room with General Tilney, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) son, and daughter. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
explanation, defective only in being—from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) irritation of nerves and
shortness of breath—no explanation at all, was instantly given. "I am
come in a great hurry—It was all a mistake—I never promised to go—I
told them from the first I could not go.—I ran away in a great hurry to
explain it.—I did not care what you thought of me.—I would not stay for
the servant."

<p/>The business, however, though not perfectly elucidated by this speech,
soon ceased to be a puzzle. Catherine found that John Thorpe _had_
given the message; and Miss Tilney had no scruple in owning herself
greatly surprised by it. But whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother had still exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
in resentment, Catherine, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) instinctively addressed herself as
much to one as to the other in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) vindication, had no means of
knowing. Whatever might have been felt before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arrival, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eager
declarations immediately made every look and sentence as friendly as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could desire.

<p/>The affair thus happily settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was introduced by Miss Tilney to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father, and received by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with such ready, such solicitous
politeness as recalled Thorpe’s information to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mind, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
think with pleasure that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) might be sometimes depended on. To such
anxious attention was the general’s civility carried, that not aware of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) extraordinary swiftness in entering the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was quite angry
with the servant whose neglect had reduced her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to open the door of the
apartment herself. "What did William mean by it? He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) should make a point
of inquiring into the matter." And if Catherine had not most warmly
asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) innocence, it seemed likely that William would lose the
favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master forever, if not his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) place, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rapidity.

<p/>After sitting with them a quarter of an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rose to take leave,
and was then most agreeably surprised by General Tilney’s asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would do his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter the honour of dining and spending the rest of
the day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). Miss Tilney added her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own wishes. Catherine was
greatly obliged; but it was quite out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) power. Mr. and Mrs. Allen
would expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) back every moment. The general declared he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) could say
no more; the claims of Mr. and Mrs. Allen were not to be superseded;
but on some other day he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) trusted, when longer notice could be given,
they would not refuse to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">"Oh, no; Catherine
was sure they would not have the least objection, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have
great pleasure in coming."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>The general attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) himself to the
street-door, saying everything gallant as they went downstairs,
admiring the elasticity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walk, which corresponded exactly with
the spirit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dancing, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) one of the most graceful bows
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had ever beheld, when they parted.

<p/>Catherine, delighted by all that had passed, proceeded gaily to
Pulteney Street, walking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) concluded, with great elasticity,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had never thought of it before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reached home without
seeing anything more of the offended party; and now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been
triumphant throughout, had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) point, and was secure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
walk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began (as the flutter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits subsided) to doubt
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been perfectly right. A sacrifice was always noble; and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had given way to their entreaties, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should have been spared
the distressing idea of a friend displeased, a brother angry, and a
scheme of great happiness to both destroyed, perhaps through her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) means.
To ease her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind, and ascertain by the opinion of an unprejudiced
person what her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own conduct had really been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took occasion to
mention before Mr. Allen the half-settled scheme of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother and the
Thorpes for the following day. Mr. Allen caught at it directly. <div class="bookquote">"Well,"
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), "and do you think of going too?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No; I had just engaged myself to walk with Miss Tilney before they
told me of it; and therefore you know I could not go with them, could
I?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, certainly not; and I am glad you do not think of it. These schemes
are not at all the thing. Young men and women driving about the country
in open carriages! Now and then it is very well; but going to inns and
public places together! It is not right; and I wonder Mrs. Thorpe
should allow it. I am glad you do not think of going; I am sure Mrs.
Morland would not be pleased. Mrs. Allen, are not you of my way of
thinking? Do not you think these kind of projects objectionable?"

<p/>"Yes, very much so indeed. Open carriages are nasty things. A clean
gown is not five minutes’ wear in them. You are splashed getting in and
getting out; and the wind takes your hair and your bonnet in every
direction. I hate an open carriage myself."

<p/>"I know you do; but that is not the question. Do not you think it has
an odd appearance, if young ladies are frequently driven about in them
by young men, to whom they are not even related?"

<p/>"Yes, my dear, a very odd appearance indeed. I cannot bear to see it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, "then why did not you tell me so before?
I am sure if I had known it to be improper, I would not have gone with
Mr. Thorpe at all; but I always hoped you would tell me, if you thought
I was doing wrong."

<p/>"And so I should, my dear, you may depend on it; for as I told Mrs.
Morland at parting, I would always do the best for you in my power. But
one must not be over particular. Young people _will_ be young people,
as your good mother says herself. You know I wanted you, when we first
came, not to buy that sprigged muslin, but you would. Young people do
not like to be always thwarted."

<p/>"But this was something of real consequence; and I do not think you
would have found me hard to persuade."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As far as it has gone hitherto, there is no harm done,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Allen; "and I would only advise you, my dear, not to go out with Mr.
Thorpe any more."

<p/>"That is just what I was going to say," added his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Catherine, relieved for herself, felt uneasy for Isabella, and after a
moment’s thought, asked Mr. Allen whether it would not be both proper
and kind in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to write to Miss Thorpe, and explain the indecorum of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) must be as insensible as herself; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) considered that
Isabella might otherwise perhaps be going to Clifton the next day, in
spite of what had passed. Mr. Allen, however, discouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from
doing any such thing. "You had better leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) alone, my dear; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is
old enough to know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is about, and if not, has a mother to
advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Mrs. Thorpe is too indulgent beyond a doubt; but, however,
you had better not interfere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) and your brother choose to go, and
you will be only getting ill will."

<p/>Catherine submitted, and though sorry to think that Isabella should be
doing wrong, felt greatly relieved by Mr. Allen’s approbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
own conduct, and truly rejoiced to be preserved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) advice from the
danger of falling into such an error herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) escape from being one
of the party to Clifton was now an escape indeed; for what would the
Tilneys have thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had broken her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) promise to them in
order to do what was wrong in itself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been guilty of one
breach of propriety, only to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to be guilty of another?
