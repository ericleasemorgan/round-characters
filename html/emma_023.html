<p/>Small heart had Harriet for visiting. Only half an hour before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend called for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evil stars had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to the very spot where, at that moment, a trunk, directed to The Rev. Philip Elton, White-Hart, Bath, was to be seen under the operation of being lifted into the butcher's cart, which was to convey it to where the coaches past; and every thing in this world, excepting that trunk and the direction, was consequently a blank.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went, however; and when they reached the farm, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to be put down, at the end of the broad, neat gravel walk, which led between espalier apple-trees to the front door, the sight of every thing which had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much pleasure the autumn before, was beginning to revive a little local agitation; and when they parted, Emma observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be looking around with a sort of fearful curiosity, which determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to allow the visit to exceed the proposed quarter of an hour. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went on herself, to give that portion of time to an old servant who was married, and settled in Donwell.

<p/>The quarter of an hour brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) punctually to the white gate again; and Miss Smith receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) summons, was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) without delay, and unattended by any alarming young man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) came solitarily down the gravel walk a Miss Martin just appearing at the door, and parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) seemingly with ceremonious civility.

<p/>Harriet could not very soon give an intelligible account. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was feeling too much; but at last Emma collected from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) enough to understand the sort of meeting, and the sort of pain it was creating. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had seen only Mrs. Martin and the two girls. They had received her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doubtingly, if not coolly; and nothing beyond the merest commonplace had been talked almost all the time till just at last, when Mrs. Martin's saying, all of a sudden, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought Miss Smith was grown, had brought on a more interesting subject, and a warmer manner. In that very room she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been measured last September, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) two friends. There were the pencilled marks and memorandums on the wainscot by the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had done it. They all seemed to remember the day, the hour, the party, the occasion to feel the same consciousness, the same regrets to be ready to return to the same good understanding; and they were just growing again like themselves, (Harriet, as Emma must suspect, as ready as the best of them to be cordial and happy,) when the carriage reappeared, and all was over. The style of the visit, and the shortness of it, were then felt to be decisive. Fourteen minutes to be given to those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had thankfully passed six weeks not six months ago! Emma could not but picture it all, and feel how justly they might resent, how naturally Harriet must suffer. It was a bad business. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have given a great deal, or endured a great deal, to have had the Martins in a higher rank of life. They were so deserving, that a little higher should have been enough: but as it was, how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) have done otherwise? Impossible! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not repent. They must be separated; but there was a great deal of pain in the process so much to herself at this time, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) soon felt the necessity of a little consolation, and resolved on going home by way of Randalls to procure it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was quite sick of Mr. Elton and the Martins. The refreshment of Randalls was absolutely necessary.

<p/>It was a good scheme; but on driving to the door they heard that neither "master nor mistress was at home;" they had both been out some time; the man believed they were gone to Hartfield.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is too bad,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, as they turned away. "And now we shall just miss them; too provoking! I do not know when I have been so disappointed." And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaned back in the corner, to indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) murmurs, or to reason them away; probably a little of both such being the commonest process of a not ill-disposed mind. Presently the carriage stopt; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked up; it was stopt by Mr. and Mrs. Weston, who were standing to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). There was instant pleasure in the sight of them, and still greater pleasure was conveyed in sound for Mr. Weston immediately accosted her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with,

<p/>"How d'ye do? how d'ye do? We have been sitting with your father glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so well. Frank comes to-morrow I had a letter this morning we see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) to-morrow by dinner-time to a certainty he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is at Oxford to-day, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes for a whole fortnight; I knew it would be so. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had come at Christmas he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) could not have staid three days; I was always glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) did not come at Christmas; now we are going to have just the right weather for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), fine, dry, settled weather. We shall enjoy him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) completely; every thing has turned out exactly as we could wish."

<p/>There was no resisting such news, no possibility of avoiding the influence of such a happy face as Mr. Weston's, confirmed as it all was by the words and the countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, fewer and quieter, but not less to the purpose. To know that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) coming certain was enough to make Emma consider it so, and sincerely did she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rejoice in their joy. It was a most delightful reanimation of exhausted spirits. The worn-out past was sunk in the freshness of what was coming; and in the rapidity of half a moment's thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hoped Mr. Elton would now be talked of no more.

<p/>Mr. Weston gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the history of the engagements at Enscombe, which allowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son to answer for having an entire fortnight at his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) command, as well as the route and the method of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) journey; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened, and smiled, and congratulated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall soon bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) over to Hartfield,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), at the conclusion.

<p/>Emma could imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw a touch of the arm at this speech, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We had better move on, Mr. Weston,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"we are detaining the girls."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, well, I am ready;"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>and turning again to Emma, "but you must not be expecting such a very fine young man; you have only had my account you know; I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is really nothing extraordinary:" though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own sparkling eyes at the moment were speaking a very different conviction.

<p/>Emma could look perfectly unconscious and innocent, and answer in a manner that appropriated nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Think of me to-morrow, my dear Emma, about four o'clock,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Weston's parting injunction; spoken with some anxiety, and meant only for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Four o'clock! depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will be here by three,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Weston's quick amendment; and so ended a most satisfactory meeting. Emma's spirits were mounted quite up to happiness; every thing wore a different air; James and his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) horses seemed not half so sluggish as before. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at the hedges, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought the elder at least must soon be coming out; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned round to Harriet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw something like a look of spring, a tender smile even there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Will Mr. Frank Churchill pass through Bath as well as Oxford?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a question, however, which did not augur much.

<p/>But neither geography nor tranquillity could come all at once, and Emma was now in a humour to resolve that they should both come in time.

<p/>The morning of the interesting day arrived, and Mrs. Weston's faithful pupil did not forget either at ten, or eleven, or twelve o'clock, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at four.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear, dear anxious friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in mental soliloquy, while walking downstairs from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own room, "always overcareful for every body's comfort but your own; I see you now in all your little fidgets, going again and again into his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) room, to be sure that all is right." The clock struck twelve as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passed through the hall. "'Tis twelve; I shall not forget to think of you four hours hence; and by this time to-morrow, perhaps, or a little later, I may be thinking of the possibility of their all calling here. I am sure they will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) soon."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opened the parlour door, and saw two gentlemen sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father Mr. Weston and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son. They had been arrived only a few minutes, and Mr. Weston had scarcely finished his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) explanation of Frank's being a day before his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) time, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father was yet in the midst of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very civil welcome and congratulations, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appeared, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) share of surprize, introduction, and pleasure.

<p/>The Frank Churchill so long talked of, so high in interest, was actually before her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was presented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not think too much had been said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) praise; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was a very good looking young man; height, air, address, all were unexceptionable, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) countenance had a great deal of the spirit and liveliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked quick and sensible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt immediately that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and there was a well-bred ease of manner, and a readiness to talk, which convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came intending to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and that acquainted they soon must be.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had reached Randalls the evening before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was pleased with the eagerness to arrive which had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) plan, and travel earlier, later, and quicker, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might gain half a day.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I told you yesterday,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston with exultation, "I told you all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be here before the time named. I remembered what I used to do myself. One cannot creep upon a journey; one cannot help getting on faster than one has planned; and the pleasure of coming in upon one's friends before the look-out begins, is worth a great deal more than any little exertion it needs."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a great pleasure where one can indulge in it,"  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man, "though there are not many houses that I should presume on so far; but in coming home I felt I might do any thing.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The word home made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father look on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with fresh complacency. Emma was directly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew how to make himself agreeable; the conviction was strengthened by what followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very much pleased with Randalls, thought it a most admirably arranged house, would hardly allow it even to be very small, admired the situation, the walk to Highbury, Highbury itself, Hartfield still more, and professed himself to have always felt the sort of interest in the country which none but one's own country gives, and the greatest curiosity to visit it. That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should never have been able to indulge so amiable a feeling before, passed suspiciously through Emma's brain; but still, if it were a falsehood, it was a pleasant one, and pleasantly handled. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner had no air of study or exaggeration. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did really look and speak as if in a state of no common enjoyment.

<p/>Their subjects in general were such as belong to an opening acquaintance. On his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) side were the inquiries, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a horsewoman? Pleasant rides? Pleasant walks? Had they a large neighbourhood? Highbury, perhaps, afforded society enough? There were several very pretty houses in and about it. Balls had they balls? Was it a musical society?"

<p/>But when satisfied on all these points, and their acquaintance proportionably advanced, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) contrived to find an opportunity, while their two fathers were engaged with each other, of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mother-in-law, and speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with so much handsome praise, so much warm admiration, so much gratitude for the happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) secured to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very kind reception of himself, as was an additional proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knowing how to please and of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) certainly thinking it worth while to try to please her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) did not advance a word of praise beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) knew to be thoroughly deserved by Mrs. Weston; but, undoubtedly he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could know very little of the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) understood what would be welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could be sure of little else. <div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father's marriage,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">"had been the wisest measure, every friend must rejoice in it; and the family from whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received such a blessing must be ever considered as having conferred the highest obligation on him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) got as near as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could to thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) for Miss Taylor's merits, without seeming quite to forget that in the common course of things it was to be rather supposed that Miss Taylor had formed Miss Woodhouse's character, than Miss Woodhouse Miss Taylor's. And at last, as if resolved to qualify his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) opinion completely for travelling round to its object, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wound it all up with astonishment at the youth and beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) person.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Elegant, agreeable manners, I was prepared for,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"but I confess that, considering every thing, I had not expected more than a very tolerably well-looking woman of a certain age; I did not know that I was to find a pretty young woman in Mrs. Weston."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"You cannot see too much perfection in Mrs. Weston for my feelings,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma; "were you to guess her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be eighteen, I should listen with pleasure; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would be ready to quarrel with you for using such words. Don't let her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagine that you have spoken of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as a pretty young woman."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope I should know better,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) replied; "no, depend upon it, (with a gallant bow,) that in addressing Mrs. Weston I should understand whom I might praise without any danger of being thought extravagant in my terms."

<p/>Emma wondered whether the same suspicion of what might be expected from their knowing each other, which had taken strong possession of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, had ever crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>); and whether his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) compliments were to be considered as marks of acquiescence, or proofs of defiance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must see more of him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ways; at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only felt they were agreeable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had no doubt of what Mr. Weston was often thinking about. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quick eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) detected again and again glancing towards them with a happy expression; and even, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might have determined not to look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was often listening.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own father's perfect exemption from any thought of the kind, the entire deficiency in him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) of all such sort of penetration or suspicion, was a most comfortable circumstance. Happily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was not farther from approving matrimony than from foreseeing it. Though always objecting to every marriage that was arranged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never suffered beforehand from the apprehension of any; it seemed as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not think so ill of any two persons' understanding as to suppose they meant to marry till it were proved against them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blessed the favouring blindness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could now, without the drawback of a single unpleasant surmise, without a glance forward at any possible treachery in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) guest, give way to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) natural kind-hearted civility in solicitous inquiries after Mr. Frank Churchill's accommodation on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) journey, through the sad evils of sleeping two nights on the road, and express very genuine unmixed anxiety to know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had certainly escaped catching cold which, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to feel quite assured of himself till after another night.

<p/>A reasonable visit paid, Mr. Weston began to move. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be going. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had business at the Crown about his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) hay, and a great many errands for Mrs. Weston at Ford's, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) need not hurry any body else." His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son, too well bred to hear the hint, rose immediately also, saying,

<p/>"As you are going farther on business, sir, I will take the opportunity of paying a visit, which must be paid some day or other, and therefore may as well be paid now. I have the honour of being acquainted with a neighbour of yours, (turning to Emma,) a lady residing in or near Highbury; a family of the name of Fairfax. I shall have no difficulty, I suppose, in finding the house; though Fairfax, I believe, is not the proper name I should rather say Barnes, or Bates. Do you know any family of that name?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To be sure we do,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Barnes</b></font>) father; "Mrs. Bates we passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) house I saw Miss Bates at the window. True, true, you are acquainted with Miss Fairfax; I remember you knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) at Weymouth, and a fine girl she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is. Call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), by all means."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no necessity for my calling this morning,"  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>said the young man; "another day would do as well; but there was that degree of acquaintance at Weymouth which "

<p/>"Oh! go to-day, go to-day. Do not defer it. What is right to be done cannot be done too soon. And, besides, I must give you a hint, Frank; any want of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) here should be carefully avoided. You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with the Campbells, when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was the equal of every body she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mixed with, but here she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is with a poor old grandmother, who has barely enough to live on. If you do not call early it will be a slight.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The son looked convinced.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) speak of the acquaintance," said Emma; "she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a very elegant young woman."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) agreed to it, but with so quiet a <div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>as inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) almost to doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) real concurrence; and yet there must be a very distinct sort of elegance for the fashionable world, if Jane Fairfax could be thought only ordinarily gifted with it.

<p/>"If you were never particularly struck by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) manners before," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "I think you will to-day. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to advantage; see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) no, I am afraid you will not hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has an aunt who never holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tongue."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are acquainted with Miss Jane Fairfax, sir, are you?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, always the last to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) way in conversation; "then give me leave to assure you that you will find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a very agreeable young lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is staying here on a visit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmama and aunt, very worthy people; I have known them all my life. They will be extremely glad to see you, I am sure; and one of my servants shall go with you to shew you the way."

<p/>"My dear sir, upon no account in the world; my father can direct me."

<p/>"But your father is not going so far; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is only going to the Crown, quite on the other side of the street, and there are a great many houses; you might be very much at a loss, and it is a very dirty walk, unless you keep on the footpath; but my coachman can tell you where you had best cross the street."

<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill still declined it, looking as serious as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hearty support by calling out, "My good friend, this is quite unnecessary; Frank knows a puddle of water when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sees it, and as to Mrs. Bates's, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may get there from the Crown in a hop, step, and jump."

<p/>They were permitted to go alone; and with a cordial nod from one, and a graceful bow from the other, the two gentlemen took leave. Emma remained very well pleased with this beginning of the acquaintance, and could now engage to think of them all at Randalls any hour of the day, with full confidence in their comfort.
