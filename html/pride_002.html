<p/>Mr. Bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on Mr.
Bingley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had always intended to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), though to the last
always assuring his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wife that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should not go; and till the
evening after the visit was paid she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no knowledge of it. It
was then disclosed in the following manner. Observing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) second
daughter employed in trimming a hat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) suddenly addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
with:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope Mr. Bingley will like it, Lizzy."

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"We are not in a way to know _what_ Mr. Bingley likes,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
mother resentfully, "since we are not to visit."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But you forget, mamma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "that we shall meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
at the assemblies, and that Mrs. Long promised to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)."

<p/>"I do not believe Mrs. Long will do any such thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) has two
nieces of her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) is a selfish, hypocritical woman, and I
have no opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No more have I,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet; "and I am glad to find that
you do not depend on her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) serving you.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Bennet deigned not to make any reply, but, unable to contain
herself, began scolding one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>Don’t keep coughing so, Kitty, for Heaven’s sake! Have a little
compassion on my nerves. You tear them to pieces."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Kitty has no discretion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) coughs,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father; "she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
times them ill."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not cough for my own amusement,"  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>replied Kitty fretfully.
"When is your next ball to be, Lizzy?"

<p/>"To-morrow fortnight."

<p/>"Aye, so it is,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) mother, " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Long</b></font>)</div>and Mrs. Long does not come
back till the day before; so it will be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) to
introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) will not know him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) herself."

<p/>"Then, my dear, you may have the advantage of your friend, and
introduce Mr. Bingley to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)_."

<p/>"Impossible, Mr. Bennet, impossible, when I am not acquainted
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) myself; how can you be so teasing?"

<p/>"I honour your circumspection. A fortnight’s acquaintance is
certainly very little. One cannot know what a man really is by
the end of a fortnight. But if _we_ do not venture somebody else
will; and after all, Mrs. Long and her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) nieces must stand their
chance; and, therefore, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) will think it an act of kindness,
if you decline the office, I will take it on myself.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The girls stared at their father. Mrs. Bennet said only,
" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Nonsense, nonsense!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).
"Do you consider the forms of introduction, and the stress that
is laid on them, as nonsense? I cannot quite agree with you
_there_. What say you, Mary? For you are a young lady of deep
reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mary wished to say something sensible, but knew not how.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>While Mary is adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ideas," he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, "let us return
to Mr. Bingley."

<p/>"I am sick of Mr. Bingley,<div class="bookquote">" cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wife.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley</b></font>)</div>I am sorry to hear _that_; but why did not you tell me that
before? If I had known as much this morning I certainly would not
have called on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). It is very unlucky; but as I have actually
paid the visit, we cannot escape the acquaintance now.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The astonishment of the ladies was just what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wished; that of
Mrs. Bennet perhaps surpassing the rest; though, when the first
tumult of joy was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began to declare that it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
had expected all the while.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>How good it was in you, my dear Mr. Bennet! But I knew I should
persuade you at last. I was sure you loved your girls too well to
neglect such an acquaintance. Well, how pleased I am! and it is
such a good joke, too, that you should have gone this morning and
never said a word about it till now."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now, Kitty, you may cough as much as you choose,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Bennet; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) spoke, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) left the room, fatigued with the
raptures of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife.

<p/>"What an excellent father you have, girls!" said she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), when the
door was shut. "I do not know how you will ever make him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) amends
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) kindness; or me, either, for that matter. At our time of
life it is not so pleasant, I can tell you, to be making new
acquaintances every day; but for your sakes, we would do
anything. Lydia, my love, though you _are_ the youngest, I dare
say Mr. Bingley will dance with you at the next ball."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>said Lydia stoutly, "I am not afraid; for though I _am_ the
youngest, I’m the tallest."

<p/>The rest of the evening was spent in conjecturing how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
would return Mr. Bennet’s visit, and determining when they should
ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to dinner.
