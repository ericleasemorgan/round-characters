possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.

<p/>However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be
on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) first entering a neighbourhood, this truth is so well
fixed in the minds of the surrounding families, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is
considered the rightful property of some one or other of their
daughters.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Mr. Bennet,"  (<font color='red'><b>lady day</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lady to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) one day, "have you
heard that Netherfield Park is let at last?"

<p/>Mr. Bennet replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had not.

<p/>"But it is," returned she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"for Mrs. Long has just been here, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) told me all about it."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do you not want to know who has taken it?"  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife
impatiently.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_You_ want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>This was invitation enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is
taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of England;
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) came down on Monday in a chaise and four to see the
place, and was so much delighted with it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) agreed with Mr.
Morris immediately; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is to take possession before
Michaelmas, and some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) servants are to be in the house by
the end of next week."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"What is his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) name?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Bingley."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) married or single?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! Single, my dear, to be sure! A single man of large fortune;
four or five thousand a year. What a fine thing for our girls!"

<p/>"How so? How can it affect them?"

<p/>"My dear Mr. Bennet,<div class="bookquote">" replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>how can you be so
tiresome! You must know that I am thinking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) marrying one of
them."

<p/>"Is that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) design in settling here?"

<p/>"Design! Nonsense, how can you talk so! But it is very likely
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) _may_ fall in love with one of them, and therefore you
must visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) comes."

<p/>"I see no occasion for that. You and the girls may go, or you may
send them by themselves, which perhaps will be still better, for
as you are as handsome as any of them, Mr. Bingley may like you
the best of the party."

<p/>"My dear, you flatter me. I certainly _have_ had my share of
beauty, but I do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now.
When a woman has five grown-up daughters, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to give over
thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own beauty."

<p/>"In such cases, a woman has not often much beauty to think of."

<p/>"But, my dear, you must indeed go and see Mr. Bingley when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
comes into the neighbourhood."

<p/>"It is more than I engage for, I assure you."

<p/>"But consider your daughters. Only think what an establishment it
would be for one of them. Sir William and Lady Lucas are
determined to go, merely on that account, for in general, you
know, they visit no newcomers. Indeed you must go, for it will be
impossible for _us_ to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) if you do not."

<p/>"You are over-scrupulous, surely. I dare say Mr. Bingley will be
very glad to see you; and I will send a few lines by you to
assure him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of my hearty consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) marrying whichever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
chooses of the girls; though I must throw in a good word for my
little Lizzy."

<p/>"I desire you will do no such thing. Lizzy is not a bit better
than the others; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is not half so handsome as
Jane, nor half so good-humoured as Lydia. But you are always
giving _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ the preference."

<p/>"They have none of them much to recommend them," replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>);
"they are all silly and ignorant like other girls; but Lizzy has
something more of quickness than her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) sisters.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bennet, how can you abuse your own children in such a way?
You take delight in vexing me. You have no compassion for my poor
nerves."

<p/>"You mistake me, my dear. I have a high respect for your nerves.
They are my old friends. I have heard you mention them with
consideration these last twenty years at least."

<p/>"Ah, you do not know what I suffer."

<p/>"But I hope you will get over it, and live to see many young men
of four thousand a year come into the neighbourhood."

<p/>"It will be no use to us, if twenty such should come, since you
will not visit them."

<p/>"Depend upon it, my dear, that when there are twenty, I will
visit them all."

<p/>Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour,
reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty
years had been insufficient to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
character. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ mind was less difficult to develop. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was a
woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain
temper. When she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was discontented, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fancied herself nervous.
The business of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) life was to get her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughters married; its
solace was visiting and news.
