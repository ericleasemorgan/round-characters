<p/>Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from
what Elinor had expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was prepared to be wet through, fatigued,
and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did
not go at all.

<p/>By ten o’clock the whole party was assembled at the park, where they
were to breakfast. The morning was rather favourable, though it had
rained all night, as the clouds were then dispersing across the sky,
and the sun frequently appeared. They were all in high spirits and good
humour, eager to be happy, and determined to submit to the greatest
inconveniences and hardships rather than be otherwise.

<p/>While they were at breakfast the letters were brought in. Among the
rest there was one for Colonel Brandon;—he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) took it, looked at the
direction, changed colour, and immediately left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What is the matter with Brandon?"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John.

<p/>Nobody could tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) has had no bad news,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton. <div class="bookquote">"It must be
something extraordinary that could make Colonel Brandon leave my
breakfast table so suddenly."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>In about five minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) returned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No bad news, Colonel, I hope;"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
entered the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"None at all, ma’am, I thank you."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Was it from Avignon? I hope it is not to say that your sister is
worse."

<p/>"No, ma’am. It came from town, and is merely a letter of business."

<p/>"But how came the hand to discompose you so much, if it was only a
letter of business? Come, come, this won’t do, Colonel; so let us hear
the truth of it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton, "recollect what you are saying."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps it is to tell you that your cousin Fanny is married?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Jennings, without attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) daughter’s reproof.

<p/>"No, indeed, it is not."

<p/>"Well, then, I know who it is from, Colonel. And I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is well."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Whom do you mean, ma’am?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), colouring a little.

<p/>"Oh! you know who I mean."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am particularly sorry, ma’am,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), addressing Lady Middleton,
"that I should receive this letter today, for it is on business which
requires my immediate attendance in town."

<p/>"In town!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Jennings. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What can you have to do in town at
this time of year?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My own loss is great,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) continued, "in being obliged to leave so
agreeable a party; but I am the more concerned, as I fear my presence
is necessary to gain your admittance at Whitwell.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>What a blow upon them all was this!

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div>But if you write a note to the housekeeper, Mr. Brandon," said
Marianne, eagerly, "will it not be sufficient?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) head.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>We must go," said Sir John.—"It shall not be put off when we are so
near it. You cannot go to town till tomorrow, Brandon, that is all."

<p/>"I wish it could be so easily settled. But it is not in my power to
delay my journey for one day!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you would but let us know what your business is,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Jennings, "we might see whether it could be put off or not."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You would not be six hours later,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, "if you were to
defer your journey till our return."

<p/>"I cannot afford to lose _one_ hour."

<p/>Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, "There
are some people who cannot bear a party of pleasure. Brandon is one of
them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was afraid of catching cold I dare say, and invented this
trick for getting out of it. I would lay fifty guineas the letter was
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own writing."

<p/>"I have no doubt of it,<div class="bookquote">" replied Marianne.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There is no persuading you to change your mind, Brandon, I know of
old," said Sir John, "when once you are determined on anything. But,
however, I hope you will think better of it. Consider, here are the two
Miss Careys come over from Newton, the three Miss Dashwoods walked up
from the cottage, and Mr. Willoughby got up two hours before his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual
time, on purpose to go to Whitwell.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Colonel Brandon again repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sorrow at being the cause of
disappointing the party; but at the same time declared it to be
unavoidable.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Well, then, when will you come back again?"

<p/>"I hope we shall see you at Barton,<div class="bookquote">" added her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) ladyship, " (<font color='red'><b>Barton</b></font>)</div>as soon as
you can conveniently leave town; and we must put off the party to
Whitwell till you return."

<p/>"You are very obliging. But it is so uncertain, when I may have it in
my power to return, that I dare not engage for it at all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Whitwell</b></font>) must and shall come back,"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John. "If he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not here
by the end of the week, I shall go after him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)."

<p/>"Ay, so do, Sir John,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Jennings, " (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>and then perhaps you may
find out what his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) business is."

<p/>"I do not want to pry into other men’s concerns. I suppose it is
something he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is ashamed of.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Colonel Brandon’s horses were announced.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You do not go to town on horseback, do you?<div class="bookquote">" added Sir John.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No. Only to Honiton. I shall then go post."

<p/>"Well, as you are resolved to go, I wish you a good journey. But you
had better change your mind."

<p/>"I assure you it is not in my power.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) then took leave of the whole party.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>sisters</b></font>)</div>Is there no chance of my seeing you and your sisters in town this
winter, Miss Dashwood?"

<p/>"I am afraid, none at all."

<p/>"Then I must bid you farewell for a longer time than I should wish to
do.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>To Marianne, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) merely bowed and said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>Come Colonel," said Mrs. Jennings, "before you go, do let us know what
you are going about."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) a good morning, and, attended by Sir John, left the room.

<p/>The complaints and lamentations which politeness had hitherto
restrained, now burst forth universally; and they all agreed again and
again how provoking it was to be so disappointed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can guess what his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) business is, however,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings
exultingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Can you, ma’am?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said almost every body.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes; it is about Miss Williams, I am sure."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And who is Miss Williams?"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>asked Marianne.

<p/>"What! do not you know who Miss Williams is? I am sure you must have
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is a relation of the Colonel’s, my dear; a
very near relation. We will not say how near, for fear of shocking the
young ladies." Then, lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) voice a little, she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) said to Elinor,
"She (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) natural daughter."

<p/>"Indeed!"

<p/>"Oh, yes; and as like him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) can stare. I dare say the Colonel will
leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fortune."

<p/>When Sir John returned, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) joined most heartily in the general regret
on so unfortunate an event; concluding however by observing, that as
they were all got together, they must do something by way of being
happy; and after some consultation it was agreed, that although
happiness could only be enjoyed at Whitwell, they might procure a
tolerable composure of mind by driving about the country. The carriages
were then ordered; Willoughby’s was first, and Marianne never looked
happier than when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) got into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) drove through the park very fast,
and they were soon out of sight; and nothing more of them was seen till
their return, which did not happen till after the return of all the
rest. They both seemed delighted with their drive; but said only in
general terms that they had kept in the lanes, while the others went on
the downs.

<p/>It was settled that there should be a dance in the evening, and that
every body should be extremely merry all day long. Some more of the
Careys came to dinner, and they had the pleasure of sitting down nearly
twenty to table, which Sir John observed with great contentment.
Willoughby took his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) usual place between the two elder Miss Dashwoods.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor’s right hand; and they had not been long
seated, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) leant behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) and Willoughby, and said to
Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, "I have found you out in
spite of all your tricks. I know where you spent the morning.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne coloured, and replied very hastily, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Where, pray?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did not you know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, "that we had been out in my
curricle?"

<p/>"Yes, yes, Mr. Impudence, I know that very well, and I was determined
to find out _where_ you had been to. I hope you like your house, Miss
Marianne. It is a very large one, I know; and when I come to see you, I
hope you will have new-furnished it, for it wanted it very much when I
was there six years ago."

<p/>Marianne turned away in great confusion. Mrs. Jennings laughed
heartily; and Elinor found that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution to know where they
had been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had actually made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own woman enquire of Mr.
Willoughby’s groom; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had by that method been informed that
they had gone to Allenham, and spent a considerable time there in
walking about the garden and going all over the house.

<p/>Elinor could hardly believe this to be true, as it seemed very unlikely
that Willoughby should propose, or Marianne consent, to enter the house
while Mrs. Smith was in it, with whom Marianne had not the smallest
acquaintance.

<p/>As soon as they left the dining-room, Elinor enquired of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) about it;
and great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found that every circumstance
related by Mrs. Jennings was perfectly true. Marianne was quite angry
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for doubting it.

<p/>"Why should you imagine, Elinor, that we did not go there, or that we
did not see the house? Is not it what you have often wished to do
yourself?"

<p/>"Yes, Marianne, but I would not go while Mrs. Smith was there, and with
no other companion than Mr. Willoughby.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby/Mr. Willoughby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Willoughby however is the only person who can have a right to show
that house; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) went in an open carriage, it was impossible to
have any other companion. I never spent a pleasanter morning in my
life."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "that the pleasantness of an employment
does not always evince its propriety."

<p/>"On the contrary, nothing can be a stronger proof of it, Elinor; for if
there had been any real impropriety in what I did, I should have been
sensible of it at the time, for we always know when we are acting
wrong, and with such a conviction I could have had no pleasure."

<p/>"But, my dear Marianne, as it has already exposed you to some very
impertinent remarks, do you not now begin to doubt the discretion of
your own conduct?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If the impertinent remarks of Mrs. Jennings are to be the proof of
impropriety in conduct, we are all offending every moment of our lives.
I value not her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) censure any more than I should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) commendation. I
am not sensible of having done anything wrong in walking over Mrs.
Smith’s grounds, or in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) house. They will one day be Mr.
Willoughby’s, and—"

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>"If they were one day to be your own, Marianne, you would not be
justified in what you have done.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) blushed at this hint; but it was even visibly gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and after a ten minutes’ interval of earnest thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister again, and said with great good humour, " (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>Perhaps, Elinor, it
_was_ rather ill-judged in me to go to Allenham; but Mr. Willoughby
wanted particularly to show me the place; and it is a charming house, I
assure you.—There is one remarkably pretty sitting room up stairs; of a
nice comfortable size for constant use, and with modern furniture it
would be delightful. It is a corner room, and has windows on two sides.
On one side you look across the bowling-green, behind the house, to a
beautiful hanging wood, and on the other you have a view of the church
and village, and, beyond them, of those fine bold hills that we have so
often admired. I did not see it to advantage, for nothing could be more
forlorn than the furniture,—but if it were newly fitted up—a couple of
hundred pounds, Willoughby says, would make it one of the pleasantest
summer-rooms in England."

<p/>Could Elinor have listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) without interruption from the others,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have described every room in the house with equal delight.
