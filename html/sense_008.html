<p/>Mrs. Jennings was a widow with an ample jointure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had only two
daughters, both of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had lived to see respectably married, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had now therefore nothing to do but to marry all the rest of the
world. In the promotion of this object she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was zealously active, as far
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ability reached; and missed no opportunity of projecting
weddings among all the young people of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
remarkably quick in the discovery of attachments, and had enjoyed the
advantage of raising the blushes and the vanity of many a young lady by
insinuations of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) power over such a young man; and this kind of
discernment enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) arrival at Barton decisively to
pronounce that Colonel Brandon was very much in love with Marianne
Dashwood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rather suspected it to be so, on the very first evening
of their being together, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listening so attentively while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sang to them; and when the visit was returned by the Middletons’ dining
at the cottage, the fact was ascertained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) again.
It must be so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was perfectly convinced of it. It would be an
excellent match, for _he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)_ was rich, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ was handsome. Mrs.
Jennings had been anxious to see Colonel Brandon well married, ever
since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) connection with Sir John first brought him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knowledge;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was always anxious to get a good husband for every pretty girl.

<p/>The immediate advantage to herself was by no means inconsiderable, for
it supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) with endless jokes against them both. At the park she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
laughed at the colonel, and in the cottage at Marianne. To the former
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) raillery was probably, as far as it regarded only himself,
perfectly indifferent; but to the latter it was at first
incomprehensible; and when its object was understood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hardly knew
whether most to laugh at its absurdity, or censure its impertinence,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) considered it as an unfeeling reflection on the colonel’s
advanced years, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>) forlorn condition as an old bachelor.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, who could not think a man five years younger than
herself, so exceedingly ancient as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to the youthful fancy of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, ventured to clear Mrs. Jennings from the probability of
wishing to throw ridicule on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) age.

<p/>"But at least, Mama, you cannot deny the absurdity of the accusation,
though you may not think it intentionally ill-natured. Colonel Brandon
is certainly younger than Mrs. Jennings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is old enough to be
_my_ father; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) were ever animated enough to be in love, must
have long outlived every sensation of the kind. It is too ridiculous!
When is a man to be safe from such wit, if age and infirmity will not
protect him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Infirmity!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "do you call Colonel Brandon infirm? I can
easily suppose that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) age may appear much greater to you than to my
mother; but you can hardly deceive yourself as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) having the use of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) limbs!"

<p/>"Did not you hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) complain of the rheumatism? and is not that the
commonest infirmity of declining life?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dearest child,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mother, laughing, "at this rate you must
be in continual terror of _my_ decay; and it must seem to you a miracle
that my life has been extended to the advanced age of forty."

<p/>"Mama, you are not doing me justice. I know very well that Colonel
Brandon is not old enough to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) friends yet apprehensive of
losing him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) in the course of nature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) may live twenty years longer.
But thirty-five has nothing to do with matrimony."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "thirty-five and seventeen had better not have
any thing to do with matrimony together. But if there should by any
chance happen to be a woman who is single at seven and twenty, I should
not think Colonel Brandon’s being thirty-five any objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
marrying _her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A woman of seven and twenty,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, after pausing a moment,
"can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) home be
uncomfortable, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fortune small, I can suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might bring
herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the
provision and security of a wife. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) marrying such a woman
therefore there would be nothing unsuitable. It would be a compact of
convenience, and the world would be satisfied. In my eyes it would be
no marriage at all, but that would be nothing. To me it would seem only
a commercial exchange, in which each wished to be benefited at the
expense of the other."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It would be impossible, I know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "to convince you that
a woman of seven and twenty could feel for a man of thirty-five
anything near enough to love, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a desirable companion to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>).
But I must object to your dooming Colonel Brandon and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) wife to the
constant confinement of a sick chamber, merely because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) chanced to
complain yesterday (a very cold damp day) of a slight rheumatic feel in
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shoulders."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) talked of flannel waistcoats,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; "and with me a
flannel waistcoat is invariably connected with aches, cramps,
rheumatisms, and every species of ailment that can afflict the old and
the feeble."

<p/>"Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) been only in a violent fever, you would not have despised him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
half so much. Confess, Marianne, is not there something interesting to
you in the flushed cheek, hollow eye, and quick pulse of a fever?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Soon after this, upon Elinor’s leaving the room, " (<font color='red'><b>Mama</b></font>)</div>Mama," said Marianne,
"I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I cannot conceal from
you. I am sure Edward Ferrars is not well. We have now been here almost
a fortnight, and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) does not come. Nothing but real indisposition
could occasion this extraordinary delay. What else can detain him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) at
Norland?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Had you any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coming so soon?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood. "_I_ had
none. On the contrary, if I have felt any anxiety at all on the
subject, it has been in recollecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sometimes showed a want of
pleasure and readiness in accepting my invitation, when I talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
coming to Barton. Does Elinor expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) already?"

<p/>"I have never mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), but of course she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must."

<p/>"I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) observed
that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the
room would be wanted for some time."

<p/>"How strange this is! what can be the meaning of it! But the whole of
their behaviour to each other has been unaccountable! How cold, how
composed were their last adieus! How languid their conversation the
last evening of their being together! In Edward’s farewell there was no
distinction between Elinor and me: it was the good wishes of an
affectionate brother to both. Twice did I leave them purposely together
in the course of the last morning, and each time did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) most
unaccountably follow me out of the room. And Elinor, in quitting
Norland and Edward, cried not as I did. Even now her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command is
invariable. When is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dejected or melancholy? When does she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) try to
avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it?"
