<p/>Elizabeth’s impatience to acquaint Jane with what had happened
could no longer be overcome; and at length, resolving to suppress
every particular in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister was concerned, and preparing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to be surprised, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the next morning the
chief of the scene between Mr. Darcy and herself.

<p/>Miss Bennet’s astonishment was soon lessened by the strong
sisterly partiality which made any admiration of Elizabeth appear
perfectly natural; and all surprise was shortly lost in other
feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was sorry that Mr. Darcy should have delivered his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them; but
still more was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) grieved for the unhappiness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s
refusal must have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) being so sure of succeeding was wrong,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "and
certainly ought not to have appeared; but consider how much it
must increase his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disappointment!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, "I am heartily sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
has other feelings, which will probably soon drive away his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
regard for me. You do not blame me, however, for refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Blame you! Oh, no."

<p/>"But you blame me for having spoken so warmly of Wickham?"

<p/>"No—I do not know that you were wrong in saying what you did."

<p/>"But you _will_ know it, when I tell you what happened the very
next day."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then spoke of the letter, repeating the whole of its contents
as far as they concerned George Wickham. What a stroke was this
for poor Jane! who would willingly have gone through the world
without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole
race of mankind, as was here collected in one individual. Nor was
Darcy’s vindication, though grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings, capable of
consoling her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for such discovery. Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) labour
to prove the probability of error, and seek to clear the one
without involving the other.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This will not do,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; "you never will be able to
make both of them good for anything. Take your choice, but you
must be satisfied with only one. There is but such a quantity of
merit between them; just enough to make one good sort of man; and
of late it has been shifting about pretty much. For my part, I am
inclined to believe it all Darcy’s; but you shall do as you
choose.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>It was some time, however, before a smile could be extorted from
Jane.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not know when I have been more shocked," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). "Wickham
so very bad! It is almost past belief. And poor Mr. Darcy! Dear
Lizzy, only consider what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must have suffered. Such a
disappointment! and with the knowledge of your ill opinion, too!
and having to relate such a thing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister! It is really too
distressing. I am sure you must feel it so."

<p/>"Oh! no, my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you
so full of both. I know you will do him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) such ample justice, that
I am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent. Your
profusion makes me saving; and if you lament over him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) much
longer, my heart will be as light as a feather."

<p/>"Poor Wickham! there is such an expression of goodness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
countenance! such an openness and gentleness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manner!"

<p/>"There certainly was some great mismanagement in the education of
those two young men. One has got all the goodness, and the other
all the appearance of it."

<p/>"I never thought Mr. Darcy so deficient in the _appearance_ of it
as you used to do."

<p/>"And yet I meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a
dislike to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), without any reason. It is such a spur to one’s
genius, such an opening for wit, to have a dislike of that kind.
One may be continually abusive without saying anything just; but
one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then
stumbling on something witty."

<p/>"Lizzy, when you first read that letter, I am sure you could not
treat the matter as you do now."

<p/>"Indeed, I could not. I was uncomfortable enough, I may say
unhappy. And with no one to speak to about what I felt, no Jane
to comfort me and say that I had not been so very weak and vain
and nonsensical as I knew I had! Oh! how I wanted you!"

<p/>"How unfortunate that you should have used such very strong
expressions in speaking of Wickham to Mr. Darcy, for now they
_do_ appear wholly undeserved."

<p/>"Certainly. But the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a
most natural consequence of the prejudices I had been
encouraging. There is one point on which I want your advice. I
want to be told whether I ought, or ought not, to make our
acquaintances in general understand Wickham’s character."

<p/>Miss Bennet paused a little, and then replied, "Surely there can
be no occasion for exposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) so dreadfully. What is your
opinion?"

<p/>"That it ought not to be attempted. Mr. Darcy has not authorised
me to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) communication public. On the contrary, every
particular relative to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister was meant to be kept as much as
possible to myself; and if I endeavour to undeceive people as to
the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) conduct, who will believe me? The general
prejudice against Mr. Darcy is so violent, that it would be the
death of half the good people in Meryton to attempt to place him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
in an amiable light. I am not equal to it. Wickham will soon be
gone; and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
really is. Some time hence it will be all found out, and then we
may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before. At present
I will say nothing about it."

<p/>"You are quite right. To have his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) errors made public might ruin
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) for ever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is now, perhaps, sorry for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has done, and
anxious to re-establish a character. We must not make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
desperate."

<p/>The tumult of Elizabeth’s mind was allayed by this conversation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
for a fortnight, and was certain of a willing listener in Jane,
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might wish to talk again of either. But there was
still something lurking behind, of which prudence forbade the
disclosure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dared not relate the other half of Mr. Darcy’s
letter, nor explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister how sincerely she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been
valued by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friend. Here was knowledge in which no one could
partake; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was sensible that nothing less than a perfect
understanding between the parties could justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) in throwing
off this last encumbrance of mystery. <div class="bookquote">"And then,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "if
that very improbable event should ever take place, I shall merely
be able to tell what Bingley may tell in a much more agreeable
manner himself. The liberty of communication cannot be mine till
it has lost all its value!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was now, on being settled at home, at leisure to observe the
real state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister’s spirits. Jane was not happy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) still
cherished a very tender affection for Bingley. Having never even
fancied herself in love before, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) regard had all the warmth of
first attachment, and, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) age and disposition, greater
steadiness than most first attachments often boast; and so
fervently did she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) value his (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) remembrance, and prefer him (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to every
other man, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) good sense, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) attention to the
feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends, were requisite to check the indulgence
of those regrets which must have been injurious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own health
and their tranquillity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet one day, "what is your opinion
_now_ of this sad business of Jane’s? For my part, I am
determined never to speak of it again to anybody. I told my
sister Phillips so the other day. But I cannot find out that Jane
saw anything of him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) in London. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) is a very undeserving
young man—and I do not suppose there’s the least chance in the
world of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) now. There is no talk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) coming
to Netherfield again in the summer; and I have enquired of
everybody, too, who is likely to know."

<p/>"I do not believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) will ever live at Netherfield any more."

<p/>"Oh well! it is just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) chooses. Nobody wants him (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) to come.
Though I shall always say he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) used my daughter extremely ill; and
if I was her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>), I would not have put up with it. Well, my comfort
is, I am sure Jane will die of a broken heart; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) will
be sorry for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) has done.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But as Elizabeth could not receive comfort from any such
expectation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>Well, Lizzy,<div class="bookquote">" continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) mother, soon afterwards, " (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>and so the
Collinses live very comfortable, do they? Well, well, I only hope
it will last. And what sort of table do they keep? Charlotte is
an excellent manager, I dare say. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is half as sharp as her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is saving enough. There is nothing extravagant in
_their_ housekeeping, I dare say."

<p/>"No, nothing at all."

<p/>"A great deal of good management, depend upon it. Yes, yes.
_They_ will take care not to outrun their income. _They_ will
never be distressed for money. Well, much good may it do them!
And so, I suppose, they often talk of having Longbourn when your
father is dead. They look upon it as quite their own, I dare say,
whenever that happens."

<p/>"It was a subject which they could not mention before me."

<p/>"No; it would have been strange if they had; but I make no doubt
they often talk of it between themselves. Well, if they can be
easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own, so much the
better. _I_ should be ashamed of having one that was only
entailed on me."
