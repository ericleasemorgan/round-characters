<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners were very much admired at the
Parsonage, and the ladies all felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) must add considerably
to the pleasures of their engagements at Rosings. It was some
days, however, before they received any invitation thither—for
while there were visitors in the house, they could not be
necessary; and it was not till Easter-day, almost a week after
the gentlemen’s arrival, that they were honoured by such an
attention, and then they were merely asked on leaving church to
come there in the evening. For the last week they had seen very
little of Lady Catherine or her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter. Colonel Fitzwilliam had
called at the Parsonage more than once during the time, but Mr.
Darcy they had seen only at church.

<p/>The invitation was accepted of course, and at a proper hour they
joined the party in Lady Catherine’s drawing-room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship
received them civilly, but it was plain that their company was by
no means so acceptable as when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could get nobody else; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was, in fact, almost engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nephews, speaking to them,
especially to Darcy, much more than to any other person in the
room.

<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them; anything was
a welcome relief to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) at Rosings; and Mrs. Collins’s pretty
friend had moreover caught his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fancy very much. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) now seated
himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and talked so agreeably of Kent and
Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books
and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained
in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and
flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well
as of Mr. Darcy. _His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned
towards them with a look of curiosity; and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship,
after a while, shared the feeling, was more openly acknowledged,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not scruple to call out:

<p/>"What is that you are saying, Fitzwilliam? What is it you are
talking of? What are you telling Miss Bennet? Let me hear what it
is."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We are speaking of music, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), when no longer able
to avoid a reply.

<p/>"Of music! Then pray speak aloud. It is of all subjects my
delight. I must have my share in the conversation if you are
speaking of music. There are few people in England, I suppose,
who have more true enjoyment of music than myself, or a better
natural taste. If I had ever learnt, I should have been a great
proficient. And so would Anne, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) health had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
apply. I am confident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have performed delightfully.
How does Georgiana get on, Darcy?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Darcy spoke with affectionate praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister’s
proficiency.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am very glad to hear such a good account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)," said Lady
Catherine; "and pray tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from me, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cannot expect to
excel if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) does not practice a good deal."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I assure you, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, "that she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) does not need such
advice. She (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) practises very constantly."

<p/>"So much the better. It cannot be done too much; and when I next
write to her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>), I shall charge her (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) not to neglect it on any
account. I often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is
to be acquired without constant practice. I have told Miss Bennet
several times, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will never play really well unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
practises more; and though Mrs. Collins has no instrument, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) is
very welcome, as I have often told her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), to come to Rosings every
day, and play on the pianoforte in Mrs. Jenkinson’s room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>)
would be in nobody’s way, you know, in that part of the house."

<p/>Mr. Darcy looked a little ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt’s ill-breeding, and
made no answer.

<p/>When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of
having promised to play to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down directly to the
instrument. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) drew a chair near her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Lady Catherine listened to
half a song, and then talked, as before, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) other nephew;
till the latter walked away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and making with his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) usual
deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to
command a full view of the fair performer’s countenance.
Elizabeth saw what he (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) was doing, and at the first convenient
pause, turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>performer</b></font>) with an arch smile, and said:

<p/>"You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state
to hear me? I will not be alarmed though your sister _does_ play
so well. There is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to
be frightened at the will of others. My courage always rises at
every attempt to intimidate me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall not say you are mistaken,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, "because you
could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming
you; and I have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough
to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing
opinions which in fact are not your own."

<p/>Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said
to Colonel Fitzwilliam, "Your cousin will give you a very pretty
notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say. I am
particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose
my real character, in a part of the world where I had hoped to
pass myself off with some degree of credit. Indeed, Mr. Darcy, it
is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my
disadvantage in Hertfordshire—and, give me leave to say, very
impolitic too—for it is provoking me to retaliate, and such
things may come out as will shock your relations to hear."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am not afraid of you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), smilingly.

<p/>"Pray let me hear what you have to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of,<div class="bookquote">" cried Colonel
Fitzwilliam. " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>I should like to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) behaves among
strangers."

<p/>"You shall hear then—but prepare yourself for something very
dreadful. The first time of my ever seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in Hertfordshire,
you must know, was at a ball—and at this ball, what do you think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did? He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) danced only four dances, though gentlemen were scarce;
and, to my certain knowledge, more than one young lady was
sitting down in want of a partner. Mr. Darcy, you cannot deny the
fact."

<p/>"I had not at that time the honour of knowing any lady in the
assembly beyond my own party."

<p/>"True; and nobody can ever be introduced in a ball-room. Well,
Colonel Fitzwilliam, what do I play next? My fingers wait your
orders."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, "I should have judged better, had I sought
an introduction; but I am ill-qualified to recommend myself to
strangers."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Shall we ask your cousin the reason of this?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth,
still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam. "Shall we ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) why a man
of sense and education, and who has lived in the world, is ill
qualified to recommend himself to strangers?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can answer your question,"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam, "without applying
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>). It is because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) will not give himself the trouble."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I certainly have not the talent which some people possess,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said
Darcy, "of conversing easily with those I have never seen before.
I cannot catch their tone of conversation, or appear interested
in their concerns, as I often see done."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My fingers,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "do not move over this instrument
in the masterly manner which I see so many women’s do. They have
not the same force or rapidity, and do not produce the same
expression. But then I have always supposed it to be my own
fault—because I will not take the trouble of practising. It is
not that I do not believe _my_ fingers as capable as any other
woman’s of superior execution."

<p/>Darcy smiled and said, "You are perfectly right. You have
employed your time much better. No one admitted to the privilege
of hearing you can think anything wanting. We neither of us
perform to strangers."

<p/>Here they were interrupted by Lady Catherine, who called out to
know what they were talking of. Elizabeth immediately began
playing again. Lady Catherine approached, and, after listening
for a few minutes, said to Darcy:

<p/>"Miss Bennet would not play at all amiss if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) practised more,
and could have the advantage of a London master. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has a very
good notion of fingering, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) taste is not equal to
Anne’s. Anne would have been a delightful performer, had her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
health allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to learn."

<p/>Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
cousin’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other
could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) derived this comfort for Miss
Bingley, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might have been just as likely to marry _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) been his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) relation.

<p/>Lady Catherine continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remarks on Elizabeth’s performance,
mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility,
and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument
till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship’s carriage was ready to take them all home.
