<p/>At about the week’s end from his return to Mansfield, Tom’s immediate
danger was over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) was so far pronounced safe as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
mother perfectly easy; for being now used to the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>)
suffering, helpless state, and hearing only the best, and never
thinking beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) heard, with no disposition for alarm and no
aptitude at a hint, Lady Bertram was the happiest subject in the world
for a little medical imposition. The fever was subdued; the fever had
been his (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) complaint; of course he (<font color='blue'><b>his</b></font>) would soon be well again. Lady Bertram
could think nothing less, and Fanny shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s security, till
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) received a few lines from Edmund, written purposely to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a
clearer idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother’s situation, and acquaint her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the
apprehensions which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father had imbibed from the physician
with respect to some strong hectic symptoms, which seemed to seize the
frame on the departure of the fever. They judged it best that Lady
Bertram should not be harassed by alarms which, it was to be hoped,
would prove unfounded; but there was no reason why Fanny should not
know the truth. They were apprehensive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lungs.

<p/>A very few lines from Edmund shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the patient and the sickroom in
a juster and stronger light than all Lady Bertram’s sheets of paper
could do. There was hardly any one in the house who might not have
described, from personal observation, better than herself; not one who
was not more useful at times to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) son. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could do nothing but glide
in quietly and look at him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); but when able to talk or be talked to, or
read to, Edmund was the companion he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) preferred. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt worried him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) by
her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) cares, and Sir Thomas knew not how to bring down his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) conversation
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) voice to the level of irritation and feebleness. Edmund was all
in all. Fanny would certainly believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) so at least, and must find
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) estimation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was higher than ever when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) appeared as the
attendant, supporter, cheerer of a suffering brother. There was not
only the debility of recent illness to assist: there was also, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
now learnt, nerves much affected, spirits much depressed to calm and
raise, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own imagination added that there must be a mind to be
properly guided.

<p/>The family were not consumptive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was more inclined to hope than
fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin, except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of Miss Crawford; but Miss
Crawford gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the idea of being the child of good luck, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
selfishness and vanity it would be good luck to have Edmund the only
son.

<p/>Even in the sick chamber the fortunate Mary was not forgotten. Edmund’s
letter had this postscript. "On the subject of my last, I had actually
begun a letter when called away by Tom’s illness, but I have now
changed my mind, and fear to trust the influence of friends. When Tom
is better, I shall go."

<p/>Such was the state of Mansfield, and so it continued, with scarcely any
change, till Easter. A line occasionally added by Edmund to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother’s letter was enough for Fanny’s information. Tom’s amendment was
alarmingly slow.

<p/>Easter came particularly late this year, as Fanny had most sorrowfully
considered, on first learning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no chance of leaving
Portsmouth till after it. It came, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had yet heard nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
return—nothing even of the going to London, which was to precede her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
return. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt often expressed a wish for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), but there was no
notice, no message from the uncle on whom all depended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
could not yet leave his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) son, but it was a cruel, a terrible delay to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). The end of April was coming on; it would soon be almost three
months, instead of two, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been absent from them all, and
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) days had been passing in a state of penance, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loved
them too well to hope they would thoroughly understand; and who could
yet say when there might be leisure to think of or fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eagerness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) impatience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longings to be with them, were such
as to bring a line or two of Cowper’s Tirocinium for ever before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">"With what intense desire she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was continually on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
tongue, as the truest description of a yearning which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
suppose any schoolboy’s bosom to feel more keenly.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been coming to Portsmouth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had loved to call it her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
home, had been fond of saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was going home; the word had
been very dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and so it still was, but it must be applied to
Mansfield. _That_ was now the home. Portsmouth was Portsmouth;
Mansfield was home. They had been long so arranged in the indulgence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) secret meditations, and nothing was more consolatory to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than to
find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt using the same language: <div class="bookquote">"I cannot but say I much regret
your being from home at this distressing time, so very trying to my
spirits. I trust and hope, and sincerely wish you may never be absent
from home so long again,"  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>were most delightful sentences to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Still,
however, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) private regale. Delicacy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
careful not to betray such a preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s house. It was
always: <div class="bookquote">"When I go back into Northamptonshire, or when I return to
Mansfield, I shall do so and so."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For a great while it was so, but at
last the longing grew stronger, it overthrew caution, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found
herself talking of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should do when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went home before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
aware. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reproached herself, coloured, and looked fearfully towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father and mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) need not have been uneasy. There was no sign
of displeasure, or even of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). They were perfectly free from
any jealousy of Mansfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was as welcome to wish herself there as
to be there.

<p/>It was sad to Fanny to lose all the pleasures of spring. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not
known before what pleasures she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _had_ to lose in passing March and
April in a town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not known before how much the beginnings and
progress of vegetation had delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). What animation, both of body
and mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had derived from watching the advance of that season
which cannot, in spite of its capriciousness, be unlovely, and seeing
its increasing beauties from the earliest flowers in the warmest
divisions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s garden, to the opening of leaves of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s
plantations, and the glory of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) woods. To be losing such pleasures
was no trifle; to be losing them, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the midst of
closeness and noise, to have confinement, bad air, bad smells,
substituted for liberty, freshness, fragrance, and verdure, was
infinitely worse: but even these incitements to regret were feeble,
compared with what arose from the conviction of being missed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
best friends, and the longing to be useful to those who were wanting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)!

<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have been at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have been of service to every
creature in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been of use to all.
To all she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it
only in supporting the spirits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from
the evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless,
officious companion, too apt to be heightening danger in order to
enhance her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own importance, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being there would have been a general
good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loved to fancy how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have read to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could have talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and tried at once to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel the
blessing of what was, and prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind for what might be; and how
many walks up and down stairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and how many
messages she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have carried.

<p/>It astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Tom’s sisters could be satisfied with remaining
in London at such a time, through an illness which had now, under
different degrees of danger, lasted several weeks. _They_ might return
to Mansfield when they chose; travelling could be no difficulty to
_them_, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not comprehend how both could still keep away. If
Mrs. Rushworth could imagine any interfering obligations, Julia was
certainly able to quit London whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) chose. It appeared from one
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) aunt’s letters that Julia had offered to return if wanted, but
this was all. It was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) would rather remain where she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
was.

<p/>Fanny was disposed to think the influence of London very much at war
with all respectable attachments. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw the proof of it in Miss
Crawford, as well as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousins; _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ attachment to Edmund had
been respectable, the most respectable part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) character; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
friendship for herself had at least been blameless. Where was either
sentiment now? It was so long since Fanny had had any letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had some reason to think lightly of the friendship which had
been so dwelt on. It was weeks since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had heard anything of Miss
Crawford or of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) other connexions in town, except through Mansfield,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was beginning to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might never know whether Mr.
Crawford had gone into Norfolk again or not till they met, and might
never hear from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister any more this spring, when the following
letter was received to revive old and create some new sensations—

<p/>"Forgive me, my dear Fanny, as soon as you can, for my long silence,
and behave as if you could forgive me directly. This is my modest
request and expectation, for you are so good, that I depend upon being
treated better than I deserve, and I write now to beg an immediate
answer. I want to know the state of things at Mansfield Park, and you,
no doubt, are perfectly able to give it. One should be a brute not to
feel for the distress they are in; and from what I hear, poor Mr.
Bertram has a bad chance of ultimate recovery. I thought little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
illness at first. I looked upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) as the sort of person to be made a
fuss with, and to make a fuss himself in any trifling disorder, and was
chiefly concerned for those who had to nurse him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); but now it is
confidently asserted that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is really in a decline, that the symptoms
are most alarming, and that part of the family, at least, are aware of
it. If it be so, I am sure you must be included in that part, that
discerning part, and therefore entreat you to let me know how far I
have been rightly informed. I need not say how rejoiced I shall be to
hear there has been any mistake, but the report is so prevalent that I
confess I cannot help trembling. To have such a fine young man cut off
in the flower of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) days is most melancholy. Poor Sir Thomas will feel
it dreadfully. I really am quite agitated on the subject. Fanny, Fanny,
I see you smile and look cunning, but, upon my honour, I never bribed a
physician in my life. Poor young man! If he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to die, there will be
_two_ poor young men less in the world; and with a fearless face and
bold voice would I say to any one, that wealth and consequence could
fall into no hands more deserving of them. It was a foolish
precipitation last Christmas, but the evil of a few days may be blotted
out in part. Varnish and gilding hide many stains. It will be but the
loss of the Esquire after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name. With real affection, Fanny, like
mine, more might be overlooked. Write to me by return of post, judge of
my anxiety, and do not trifle with it. Tell me the real truth, as you
have it from the fountainhead. And now, do not trouble yourself to be
ashamed of either my feelings or your own. Believe me, they are not
only natural, they are philanthropic and virtuous. I put it to your
conscience, whether ‘Sir Edmund’ would not do more good with all the
Bertram property than any other possible <div class="bookquote">‘Sir.’  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Had the Grants been at
home I would not have troubled you, but you are now the only one I can
apply to for the truth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sisters not being within my reach. Mrs. R.
has been spending the Easter with the Aylmers at Twickenham (as to be
sure you know), and is not yet returned; and Julia is with the cousins
who live near Bedford Square, but I forget their name and street. Could
I immediately apply to either, however, I should still prefer you,
because it strikes me that they have all along been so unwilling to
have their own amusements cut up, as to shut their eyes to the truth. I
suppose Mrs. R.’s Easter holidays will not last much longer; no doubt
they are thorough holidays to her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>). The Aylmers are pleasant people; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) husband away, she (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) can have nothing but enjoyment. I give her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) credit
for promoting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) going dutifully down to Bath, to fetch his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother;
but how will she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and the dowager agree in one house? Henry is not at
hand, so I have nothing to say from him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Do not you think Edmund would
have been in town again long ago, but for this illness?—Yours ever,
Mary."

<p/>"I had actually begun folding my letter when Henry walked in, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
brings no intelligence to prevent my sending it. Mrs. R. knows a
decline is apprehended; he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) this morning: she (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) returns to Wimpole
Street to-day; the old lady is come. Now do not make yourself uneasy
with any queer fancies because he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) has been spending a few days at
Richmond. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) does it every spring. Be assured he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cares for nobody but
you. At this very moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is wild to see you, and occupied only in
contriving the means for doing so, and for making his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pleasure conduce
to yours. In proof, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) repeats, and more eagerly, what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said at
Portsmouth about our conveying you home, and I join him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) in it with all
my soul. Dear Fanny, write directly, and tell us to come. It will do us
all good. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) and I can go to the Parsonage, you know, and be no trouble
to our friends at Mansfield Park. It would really be gratifying to see
them all again, and a little addition of society might be of infinite
use to them; and as to yourself, you must feel yourself to be so wanted
there, that you cannot in conscience—conscientious as you are—keep
away, when you have the means of returning. I have not time or patience
to give half Henry’s messages; be satisfied that the spirit of each and
every one is unalterable affection."

<p/>Fanny’s disgust at the greater part of this letter, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) extreme
reluctance to bring the writer of it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund together,
would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) (as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt) incapable of judging impartially
whether the concluding offer might be accepted or not. To herself,
individually, it was most tempting. To be finding herself, perhaps
within three days, transported to Mansfield, was an image of the
greatest felicity, but it would have been a material drawback to be
owing such felicity to persons in whose feelings and conduct, at the
present moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw so much to condemn: the sister’s feelings, the
brother’s conduct, _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ cold-hearted ambition, _his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)_ thoughtless
vanity. To have him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) still the acquaintance, the flirt perhaps, of Mrs.
Rushworth! She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was mortified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had thought better of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Happily,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was not left to weigh and decide between opposite
inclinations and doubtful notions of right; there was no occasion to
determine whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) ought to keep Edmund and Mary asunder or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
had a rule to apply to, which settled everything. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) dread of taking a liberty with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), made it instantly plain to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) must absolutely decline the proposal. If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
wanted, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would send for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and even to offer an early return was a
presumption which hardly anything would have seemed to justify. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
thanked Miss Crawford, but gave a decided negative. <div class="bookquote">"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) uncle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
understood, meant to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin’s illness had
continued so many weeks without her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) being thought at all necessary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
must suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) return would be unwelcome at present, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
should be felt an encumbrance."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) representation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin’s state at this time was exactly
according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own belief of it, and such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) supposed would
convey to the sanguine mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) correspondent the hope of everything
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was wishing for. Edmund would be forgiven for being a clergyman, it
seemed, under certain conditions of wealth; and this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) suspected,
was all the conquest of prejudice which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was so ready to congratulate
himself upon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had only learnt to think nothing of consequence but
money.
