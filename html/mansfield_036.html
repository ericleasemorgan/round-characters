<p/>Edmund now believed himself perfectly acquainted with all that Fanny
could tell, or could leave to be conjectured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sentiments, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
was satisfied. It had been, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) before presumed, too hasty a measure
on Crawford’s side, and time must be given to make the idea first
familiar, and then agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must be used to the
consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and then a return of
affection might not be very distant.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gave this opinion as the result of the conversation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father;
and recommended there being nothing more said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): no farther
attempts to influence or persuade; but that everything should be left
to Crawford’s assiduities, and the natural workings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own mind.

<p/>Sir Thomas promised that it should be so. Edmund’s account of Fanny’s
disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could believe to be just; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had all those
feelings, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must consider it as very unfortunate that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _had_;
for, less willing than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) son to trust to the future, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not
help fearing that if such very long allowances of time and habit were
necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not have persuaded herself into receiving
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) addresses properly before the young man’s inclination for paying
them were over. There was nothing to be done, however, but to submit
quietly and hope the best.

<p/>The promised visit from <div class="bookquote">"her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>as Edmund called Miss Crawford,
was a formidable threat to Fanny, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lived in continual terror of
it. As a sister, so partial and so angry, and so little scrupulous of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, and in another light so triumphant and secure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
in every way an object of painful alarm. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) displeasure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
penetration, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness were all fearful to encounter; and the
dependence of having others present when they met was Fanny’s only
support in looking forward to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absented herself as little as
possible from Lady Bertram, kept away from the East room, and took no
solitary walk in the shrubbery, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) caution to avoid any sudden
attack.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was safe in the breakfast-room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunt, when
Miss Crawford did come; and the first misery over, and Miss Crawford
looking and speaking with much less particularity of expression than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had anticipated, Fanny began to hope there would be nothing worse
to be endured than a half-hour of moderate agitation. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
hoped too much; Miss Crawford was not the slave of opportunity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
determined to see Fanny alone, and therefore said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tolerably
soon, in a low voice, <div class="bookquote">"I must speak to you for a few minutes
somewhere" (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>; words that Fanny felt all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pulses and
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nerves. Denial was impossible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) habits of ready submission,
on the contrary, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) almost instantly rise and lead the way out of
the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did it with wretched feelings, but it was inevitable.

<p/>They were no sooner in the hall than all restraint of countenance was
over on Miss Crawford’s side. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) immediately shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) head at Fanny
with arch, yet affectionate reproach, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, seemed
hardly able to help beginning directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said nothing, however, but,
<div class="bookquote">"Sad, sad girl! I do not know when I shall have done scolding you,"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>and
had discretion enough to reserve the rest till they might be secure of
having four walls to themselves. Fanny naturally turned upstairs, and
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) guest to the apartment which was now always fit for
comfortable use; opening the door, however, with a most aching heart,
and feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had a more distressing scene before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than ever
that spot had yet witnessed. But the evil ready to burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was at
least delayed by the sudden change in Miss Crawford’s ideas; by the
strong effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind which the finding herself in the East room
again produced.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ha!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cried, with instant animation, "am I here again? The East
room! Once only was I in this room before"; and after stopping to look
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and seemingly to retrace all that had then passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
added, "Once only before. Do you remember it? I came to rehearse. Your
cousin came too; and we had a rehearsal. You were our audience and
prompter. A delightful rehearsal. I shall never forget it. Here we
were, just in this part of the room: here was your cousin, here was I,
here were the chairs. Oh! why will such things ever pass away?"

<p/>Happily for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) companion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted no answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was entirely
self-engrossed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was in a reverie of sweet remembrances.

<p/>"The scene we were rehearsing was so very remarkable! The subject of it
so very—very—what shall I say? He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was to be describing and recommending
matrimony to me. I think I see him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) now, trying to be as demure and
composed as Anhalt ought, through the two long speeches. <div class="bookquote">‘When two
sympathetic hearts meet in the marriage state, matrimony may be called
a happy life.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I suppose no time can ever wear out the impression I
have of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) looks and voice as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said those words. It was curious,
very curious, that we should have such a scene to play! If I had the
power of recalling any one week of my existence, it should be that
week—that acting week. Say what you would, Fanny, it should be _that_;
for I never knew such exquisite happiness in any other. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sturdy
spirit to bend as it did! Oh! it was sweet beyond expression. But alas,
that very evening destroyed it all. That very evening brought your most
unwelcome uncle. Poor Sir Thomas, who was glad to see you? Yet, Fanny,
do not imagine I would now speak disrespectfully of Sir Thomas, though
I certainly did hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for many a week. No, I do him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) justice now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
is just what the head of such a family should be. Nay, in sober
sadness, I believe I now love you all.<div class="bookquote">" And having said so, with a
degree of tenderness and consciousness which Fanny had never seen in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before, and now thought only too becoming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) turned away for a
moment to recover herself. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have had a little fit since I came into
this room, as you may perceive," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently, with a playful
smile, "but it is over now; so let us sit down and be comfortable; for
as to scolding you, Fanny, which I came fully intending to do, I have
not the heart for it when it comes to the point.<div class="bookquote">" And embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
very affectionately, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Good, gentle Fanny! when I think of this being
the last time of seeing you for I do not know how long, I feel it quite
impossible to do anything but love you."

<p/>Fanny was affected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not foreseen anything of this, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feelings could seldom withstand the melancholy influence of the word
<div class="bookquote">"last."  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had loved Miss Crawford more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
possibly could; and Miss Crawford, yet farther softened by the sight of
such emotion, hung about her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with fondness, and said, "I hate to leave
you. I shall see no one half so amiable where I am going. Who says we
shall not be sisters? I know we shall. I feel that we are born to be
connected; and those tears convince me that you feel it too, dear
Fanny."

<p/>Fanny roused herself, and replying only in part, said, "But you are
only going from one set of friends to another. You are going to a very
particular friend."

<p/>"Yes, very true. Mrs. Fraser has been my intimate friend for years. But
I have not the least inclination to go near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>). I can think only of
the friends I am leaving: my excellent sister, yourself, and the
Bertrams in general. You have all so much more _heart_ among you than
one finds in the world at large. You all give me a feeling of being
able to trust and confide in you, which in common intercourse one knows
nothing of. I wish I had settled with Mrs. Fraser not to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) till
after Easter, a much better time for the visit, but now I cannot put
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) off. And when I have done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) I must go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) sister, Lady
Stornaway, because _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ was rather my most particular friend of the
two, but I have not cared much for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ these three years."

<p/>After this speech the two girls sat many minutes silent, each
thoughtful: Fanny meditating on the different sorts of friendship in
the world, Mary on something of less philosophic tendency. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)_ first
spoke again.

<p/>"How perfectly I remember my resolving to look for you upstairs, and
setting off to find my way to the East room, without having an idea
whereabouts it was! How well I remember what I was thinking of as I
came along, and my looking in and seeing you here sitting at this table
at work; and then your cousin’s astonishment, when he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) opened the door,
at seeing me here! To be sure, your uncle’s returning that very
evening! There never was anything quite like it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Another short fit of abstraction followed, when, shaking it off, she (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
thus attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) companion.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Why, Fanny, you are absolutely in a reverie. Thinking, I hope, of one
who is always thinking of you. Oh! that I could transport you for a
short time into our circle in town, that you might understand how your
power over Henry is thought of there! Oh! the envyings and
heartburnings of dozens and dozens; the wonder, the incredulity that
will be felt at hearing what you have done! For as to secrecy, Henry is
quite the hero of an old romance, and glories in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) chains. You should
come to London to know how to estimate your conquest. If you were to
see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) is courted, and how I am courted for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sake! Now, I am
well aware that I shall not be half so welcome to Mrs. Fraser in
consequence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) situation with you. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) comes to know the truth
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) will, very likely, wish me in Northamptonshire again; for there is
a daughter of Mr. Fraser, by a first wife, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is wild to get
married, and wants Henry to take. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has been trying for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to
such a degree. Innocent and quiet as you sit here, you cannot have an
idea of the _sensation_ that you will be occasioning, of the curiosity
there will be to see you, of the endless questions I shall have to
answer! Poor Margaret Fraser will be at me for ever about your eyes and
your teeth, and how you do your hair, and who makes your shoes. I wish
Margaret were married, for my poor friend’s sake, for I look upon the
Frasers to be about as unhappy as most other married people. And yet it
was a most desirable match for Janet at the time. We were all
delighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) could not do otherwise than accept him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was rich,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) had nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turns out ill-tempered and _exigeant_, and
wants a young woman, a beautiful young woman of five-and-twenty, to be
as steady as himself. And my friend does not manage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) well; she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does
not seem to know how to make the best of it. There is a spirit of
irritation which, to say nothing worse, is certainly very ill-bred. In
their house I shall call to mind the conjugal manners of Mansfield
Parsonage with respect. Even Dr. Grant does shew a thorough confidence
in my sister, and a certain consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) judgment, which makes
one feel there _is_ attachment; but of that I shall see nothing with
the Frasers. I shall be at Mansfield for ever, Fanny. My own sister as
a wife, Sir Thomas Bertram as a husband, are my standards of
perfection. Poor Janet has been sadly taken in, and yet there was
nothing improper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) side: she (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) did not run into the match
inconsiderately; there was no want of foresight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) took three days to
consider of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) proposals, and during those three days asked the advice
of everybody connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Janet</b></font>) whose opinion was worth having, and
especially applied to my late dear aunt, whose knowledge of the world
made her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) judgment very generally and deservedly looked up to by all the
young people of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) acquaintance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was decidedly in favour of
Mr. Fraser. This seems as if nothing were a security for matrimonial
comfort. I have not so much to say for my friend Flora, who jilted a
very nice young man in the Blues for the sake of that horrid Lord
Stornaway, who has about as much sense, Fanny, as Mr. Rushworth, but
much worse-looking, and with a blackguard character. I _had_ my doubts
at the time about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being right, for he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has not even the air of a
gentleman, and now I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was wrong. By the bye, Flora Ross was
dying for Henry the first winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Flora</b></font>) came out. But were I to attempt to
tell you of all the women whom I have known to be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), I
should never have done. It is you, only you, insensible Fanny, who can
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with anything like indifference. But are you so insensible
as you profess yourself? No, no, I see you are not.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>There was, indeed, so deep a blush over Fanny’s face at that moment as
might warrant strong suspicion in a predisposed mind.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>creature</b></font>)</div>Excellent creature! I will not tease you. Everything shall take its
course. But, dear Fanny, you must allow that you were not so absolutely
unprepared to have the question asked as your cousin fancies. It is not
possible but that you must have had some thoughts on the subject, some
surmises as to what might be. You must have seen that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) was trying to
please you by every attention in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) power. Was not he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) devoted to you
at the ball? And then before the ball, the necklace! Oh! you received
it just as it was meant. You were as conscious as heart could desire. I
remember it perfectly."

<p/>"Do you mean, then, that your brother knew of the necklace beforehand?
Oh! Miss Crawford, _that_ was not fair."

<p/>"Knew of it! It was his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own doing entirely, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own thought. I am
ashamed to say that it had never entered my head, but I was delighted
to act on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) proposal for both your sakes."

<p/>"I will not say,<div class="bookquote">" replied Fanny, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that I was not half afraid at the
time of its being so, for there was something in your look that
frightened me, but not at first; I was as unsuspicious of it at
first—indeed, indeed I was. It is as true as that I sit here. And had I
had an idea of it, nothing should have induced me to accept the
necklace. As to your brother’s behaviour, certainly I was sensible of a
particularity: I had been sensible of it some little time, perhaps two
or three weeks; but then I considered it as meaning nothing: I put it
down as simply being his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) way, and was as far from supposing as from
wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to have any serious thoughts of me. I had not, Miss
Crawford, been an inattentive observer of what was passing between him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
and some part of this family in the summer and autumn. I was quiet, but
I was not blind. I could not but see that Mr. Crawford amused himself
in gallantries which did mean nothing."

<p/>"Ah! I cannot deny it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has now and then been a sad flirt, and cared
very little for the havoc he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might be making in young ladies’
affections. I have often scolded him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for it, but it is his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only fault;
and there is this to be said, that very few young ladies have any
affections worth caring for. And then, Fanny, the glory of fixing one
who has been shot at by so many; of having it in one’s power to pay off
the debts of one’s sex! Oh! I am sure it is not in woman’s nature to
refuse such a triumph.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot think well of a man who sports with any
woman’s feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered
than a stander-by can judge of."

<p/>"I do not defend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). I leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) entirely to your mercy, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
has got you at Everingham, I do not care how much you lecture him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But
this I will say, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fault, the liking to make girls a little in
love with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), is not half so dangerous to a wife’s happiness as a
tendency to fall in love himself, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has never been addicted to.
And I do seriously and truly believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is attached to you in a
way that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never was to any woman before; that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves you with all
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart, and will love you as nearly for ever as possible. If any man
ever loved a woman for ever, I think Henry will do as much for you.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny could not avoid a faint smile, but had nothing to say.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot imagine Henry ever to have been happier,<div class="bookquote">" continued Mary
presently, " (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had succeeded in getting your brother’s
commission.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had made a sure push at Fanny’s feelings here.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! yes. How very, very kind of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)."

<p/>"I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have exerted himself very much, for I know the parties
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had to move. The Admiral hates trouble, and scorns asking favours;
and there are so many young men’s claims to be attended to in the same
way, that a friendship and energy, not very determined, is easily put
by. What a happy creature William must be! I wish we could see him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)."

<p/>Poor Fanny’s mind was thrown into the most distressing of all its
varieties. The recollection of what had been done for William was
always the most powerful disturber of every decision against Mr.
Crawford; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat thinking deeply of it till Mary, who had been
first watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) complacently, and then musing on something else,
suddenly called her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attention by saying: "I should like to sit talking
with you here all day, but we must not forget the ladies below, and so
good-bye, my dear, my amiable, my excellent Fanny, for though we shall
nominally part in the breakfast-parlour, I must take leave of you here.
And I do take leave, longing for a happy reunion, and trusting that
when we meet again, it will be under circumstances which may open our
hearts to each other without any remnant or shadow of reserve.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>A very, very kind embrace, and some agitation of manner, accompanied
these words.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shall see your cousin in town soon: he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) talks of being there
tolerably soon; and Sir Thomas, I dare say, in the course of the
spring; and your eldest cousin, and the Rushworths, and Julia, I am
sure of meeting again and again, and all but you. I have two favours to
ask, Fanny: one is your correspondence. You must write to me. And the
other, that you will often call on Mrs. Grant, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) amends for
my being gone."

<p/>The first, at least, of these favours Fanny would rather not have been
asked; but it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to refuse the correspondence; it
was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) even not to accede to it more readily than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own judgment authorised. There was no resisting so much apparent
affection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disposition was peculiarly calculated to value a fond
treatment, and from having hitherto known so little of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was the
more overcome by Miss Crawford’s. Besides, there was gratitude towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), for having made their _tête-à-tête_ so much less painful than her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
fears had predicted.

<p/>It was over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had escaped without reproaches and without
detection. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) secret was still her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own; and while that was the case,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could resign herself to almost everything.

<p/>In the evening there was another parting. Henry Crawford came and sat
some time with them; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits not being previously in the
strongest state, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart was softened for a while towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) really seemed to feel. Quite unlike his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) usual self, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
scarcely said anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was evidently oppressed, and Fanny must
grieve for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), though hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again till he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
were the husband of some other woman.

<p/>When it came to the moment of parting, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
not be denied it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said nothing, however, or nothing that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heard,
and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had left the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was better pleased that such a token
of friendship had passed.

<p/>On the morrow the Crawfords were gone.
