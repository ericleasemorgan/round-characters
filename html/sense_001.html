<p/>The family of Dashwood had long been settled in Sussex. Their estate
was large, and their residence was at Norland Park, in the centre of
their property, where, for many generations, they had lived in so
respectable a manner as to engage the general good opinion of their
surrounding acquaintance. The late owner of this estate was a single
man, who lived to a very advanced age, and who for many years of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
life, had a constant companion and housekeeper in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister. But her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
death, which happened ten years before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own, produced a great
alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) home; for to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) loss, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) invited and received
into his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house the family of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew Mr. Henry Dashwood, the legal
inheritor of the Norland estate, and the person to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to
bequeath it. In the society of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nephew and niece, and their
children, the old Gentleman’s days were comfortably spent. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
attachment to them all increased. The constant attention of Mr. and
Mrs. Henry Dashwood to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wishes, which proceeded not merely from
interest, but from goodness of heart, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) every degree of solid
comfort which his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) age could receive; and the cheerfulness of the
children added a relish to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) existence.

<p/>By a former marriage, Mr. Henry Dashwood had one son: by his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) present
lady, three daughters. The son, a steady respectable young man, was
amply provided for by the fortune of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) mother, which had been large,
and half of which devolved on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming of age. By his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own
marriage, likewise, which happened soon afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) added to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
wealth. To him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) therefore the succession to the Norland estate was not
so really important as to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sisters; for their fortune, independent
of what might arise to them from their father’s inheriting that
property, could be but small. Their mother had nothing, and their
father only seven thousand pounds in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own disposal; for the
remaining moiety of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first wife’s fortune was also secured to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
child, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only a life-interest in it.

<p/>The old gentleman died: his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) will was read, and like almost every other
will, gave as much disappointment as pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was neither so
unjust, nor so ungrateful, as to leave his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) estate from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) nephew;—but
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) left it to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) on such terms as destroyed half the value of the
bequest. Mr. Dashwood had wished for it more for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wife
and daughters than for himself or his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son;—but to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
son’s son, a child of four years old, it was secured, in such a way, as
to leave to himself no power of providing for those who were most dear
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), and who most needed a provision by any charge on the estate, or
by any sale of its valuable woods. The whole was tied up for the
benefit of this child, who, in occasional visits with his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father and
mother at Norland, had so far gained on the affections of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) uncle, by
such attractions as are by no means unusual in children of two or three
years old; an imperfect articulation, an earnest desire of having his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
own way, many cunning tricks, and a great deal of noise, as to outweigh
all the value of all the attention which, for years, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had received
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) niece and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) daughters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) meant not to be unkind, however,
and, as a mark of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) affection for the three girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) left them a
thousand pounds a-piece.

<p/>Mr. Dashwood’s disappointment was, at first, severe; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) temper was
cheerful and sanguine; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might reasonably hope to live many years,
and by living economically, lay by a considerable sum from the produce
of an estate already large, and capable of almost immediate
improvement. But the fortune, which had been so tardy in coming, was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) only one twelvemonth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) survived his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) uncle no longer; and ten
thousand pounds, including the late legacies, was all that remained for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) widow and daughters.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son was sent for as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) danger was known, and to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) Mr.
Dashwood recommended, with all the strength and urgency which illness
could command, the interest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother-in-law and sisters.

<p/>Mr. John Dashwood had not the strong feelings of the rest of the
family; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was affected by a recommendation of such a nature at
such a time, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promised to do every thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power to make
them comfortable. His (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father was rendered easy by such an assurance,
and Mr. John Dashwood had then leisure to consider how much there might
prudently be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power to do for them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was not an ill-disposed young man, unless to be rather cold hearted
and rather selfish is to be ill-disposed: but he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was, in general, well
respected; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conducted himself with propriety in the discharge of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) ordinary duties. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) married a more amiable woman, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might have
been made still more respectable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was:—he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might even have been
made amiable himself; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was very young when he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) married, and very
fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wife. But Mrs. John Dashwood was a strong caricature of
himself;—more narrow-minded and selfish.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) meditated within himself to
increase the fortunes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters by the present of a thousand
pounds a-piece. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) then really thought himself equal to it. The
prospect of four thousand a-year, in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) present income,
besides the remaining half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own mother’s fortune, warmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
heart, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feel capable of generosity. "Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would give
them three thousand pounds: it would be liberal and handsome! It would
be enough to make them completely easy. Three thousand pounds! he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could
spare so considerable a sum with little inconvenience." He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of
it all day long, and for many days successively, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) did not repent.

<p/>No sooner was his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) father’s funeral over, than Mrs. John Dashwood,
without sending any notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) intention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother-in-law,
arrived with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) child and their attendants. No one could dispute her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
right to come; the house was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband’s from the moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
father’s decease; but the indelicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conduct was so much the
greater, and to a woman in Mrs. Dashwood’s situation, with only common
feelings, must have been highly unpleasing;—but in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)_ mind there was
a sense of honor so keen, a generosity so romantic, that any offence of
the kind, by whomsoever given or received, was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a source of
immovable disgust. Mrs. John Dashwood had never been a favourite with
any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband’s family; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had had no opportunity, till the
present, of showing them with how little attention to the comfort of
other people she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could act when occasion required it.

<p/>So acutely did Mrs. Dashwood feel this ungracious behaviour, and so
earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law for it, that, on the
arrival of the latter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would have quitted the house for ever, had
not the entreaty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest girl induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first to reflect on the
propriety of going, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own tender love for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) three children
determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) afterwards to stay, and for their sakes avoid a breach
with their brother.

<p/>Elinor, this eldest daughter, whose advice was so effectual, possessed
a strength of understanding, and coolness of judgment, which qualified
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), though only nineteen, to be the counsellor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, and
enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frequently to counteract, to the advantage of them all,
that eagerness of mind in Mrs. Dashwood which must generally have led
to imprudence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had an excellent heart;—her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disposition was
affectionate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings were strong; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) knew how to govern
them: it was a knowledge which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother had yet to learn; and which
one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters had resolved never to be taught.

<p/>Marianne’s abilities were, in many respects, quite equal to Elinor’s.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was sensible and clever; but eager in everything: her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sorrows, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
joys, could have no moderation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was generous, amiable, interesting:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was everything but prudent. The resemblance between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother was strikingly great.

<p/>Elinor saw, with concern, the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s sensibility; but
by Mrs. Dashwood it was valued and cherished. They encouraged each
other now in the violence of their affliction. The agony of grief which
overpowered them at first, was voluntarily renewed, was sought for, was
created again and again. They gave themselves up wholly to their
sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could
afford it, and resolved against ever admitting consolation in future.
Elinor, too, was deeply afflicted; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could struggle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could exert herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother, could receive
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) arrival, and treat her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with proper attention;
and could strive to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother to similar exertion, and encourage
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to similar forbearance.

<p/>Margaret, the other sister, was a good-humored, well-disposed girl; but
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had already imbibed a good deal of Marianne’s romance, without
having much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not, at thirteen, bid fair to equal
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters at a more advanced period of life.
