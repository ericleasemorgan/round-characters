<p/><div class="bookquote">"But why should Mrs. Grant ask Fanny?"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram. "How came she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
to think of asking Fanny? Fanny never dines there, you know, in this
sort of way. I cannot spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not want to go.
Fanny, you do not want to go, do you?"

<p/>"If you put such a question to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">" cried Edmund, preventing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
cousin’s speaking, " (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Fanny will immediately say No; but I am sure, my
dear mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would like to go; and I can see no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
should not."

<p/>"I cannot imagine why Mrs. Grant should think of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) never
did before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) used to ask your sisters now and then, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) never
asked Fanny."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you cannot do without me, ma’am—"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in a self-denying
tone.

<p/>"But my mother will have my father with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) all the evening."

<p/>"To be sure, so I shall."

<p/>"Suppose you take my father’s opinion, ma’am."

<p/>"That’s well thought of. So I will, Edmund. I will ask Sir Thomas, as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes in, whether I can do without her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)."

<p/>"As you please, ma’am, on that head; but I meant my father’s opinion as
to the _propriety_ of the invitation’s being accepted or not; and I
think he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will consider it a right thing by Mrs. Grant, as well as by
Fanny, that being the _first_ invitation it should be accepted."

<p/>"I do not know. We will ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be very much surprised
that Mrs. Grant should ask Fanny at all."

<p/>There was nothing more to be said, or that could be said to any
purpose, till Sir Thomas were present; but the subject involving, as it
did, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own evening’s comfort for the morrow, was so much uppermost in
Lady Bertram’s mind, that half an hour afterwards, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looking in
for a minute in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) plantation to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dressing-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
called him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) back again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had almost closed the door, with "Sir
Thomas, stop a moment—I have something to say to you."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) tone of calm languor, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) never took the trouble of raising her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
voice, was always heard and attended to; and Sir Thomas came back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
story began; and Fanny immediately slipped out of the room; for to hear
herself the subject of any discussion with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
nerves could bear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was anxious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew—more anxious perhaps than
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to be—for what was it after all whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went or staid?
but if her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle were to be a great while considering and deciding, and
with very grave looks, and those grave looks directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and at
last decide against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might not be able to appear properly
submissive and indifferent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cause, meanwhile, went on well. It
began, on Lady Bertram’s part, with—"I have something to tell you that
will surprise you. Mrs. Grant has asked Fanny to dinner."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, as if waiting more to accomplish the surprise.

<p/>"Edmund wants her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to go. But how can I spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) will be late,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, taking out his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) watch; "but what is
your difficulty?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Edmund found himself obliged to speak and fill up the blanks in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother’s story. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told the whole; and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had only to add, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So
strange! for Mrs. Grant never used to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But is it not very natural,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>observed Edmund, "that Mrs. Grant should
wish to procure so agreeable a visitor for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nothing can be more natural,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, after a short
deliberation; "nor, were there no sister in the case, could anything,
in my opinion, be more natural. Mrs. Grant’s shewing civility to Miss
Price, to Lady Bertram’s niece, could never want explanation. The only
surprise I can feel is, that this should be the _first_ time of its
being paid. Fanny was perfectly right in giving only a conditional
answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appears to feel as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought. But as I conclude that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
must wish to go, since all young people like to be together, I can see
no reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be denied the indulgence."

<p/>"But can I do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Sir Thomas?"

<p/>"Indeed I think you may."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) always makes tea, you know, when my sister is not here."

<p/>"Your sister, perhaps, may be prevailed on to spend the day with us,
and I shall certainly be at home."

<p/>"Very well, then, Fanny may go, Edmund."

<p/>The good news soon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Edmund knocked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) door in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) way
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own.

<p/>"Well, Fanny, it is all happily settled, and without the smallest
hesitation on your uncle’s side. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had but one opinion. You are to
go."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Thank you, I am _so_ glad,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>was Fanny’s instinctive reply; though when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and shut the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help feeling,
"And yet why should I be glad? for am I not certain of seeing or
hearing something there to pain me?"

<p/>In spite of this conviction, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was glad. Simple as such an
engagement might appear in other eyes, it had novelty and importance in
hers, for excepting the day at Sotherton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had scarcely ever dined
out before; and though now going only half a mile, and only to three
people, still it was dining out, and all the little interests of
preparation were enjoyments in themselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had neither sympathy nor
assistance from those who ought to have entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings and
directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) taste; for Lady Bertram never thought of being useful to
anybody, and Mrs. Norris, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) came on the morrow, in consequence
of an early call and invitation from Sir Thomas, was in a very ill
humour, and seemed intent only on lessening her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) niece’s pleasure, both
present and future, as much as possible.

<p/>"Upon my word, Fanny, you are in high luck to meet with such attention
and indulgence! You ought to be very much obliged to Mrs. Grant for
thinking of you, and to your aunt for letting you go, and you ought to
look upon it as something extraordinary; for I hope you are aware that
there is no real occasion for your going into company in this sort of
way, or ever dining out at all; and it is what you must not depend upon
ever being repeated. Nor must you be fancying that the invitation is
meant as any particular compliment to _you_; the compliment is intended
to your uncle and aunt and me. Mrs. Grant thinks it a civility due to
_us_ to take a little notice of you, or else it would never have come
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) head, and you may be very certain that, if your cousin Julia
had been at home, you would not have been asked at all.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Norris had now so ingeniously done away all Mrs. Grant’s part of
the favour, that Fanny, who found herself expected to speak, could only
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very much obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram for sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was endeavouring to put her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s evening work in such a
state as to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being missed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! depend upon it, your aunt can do very well without you, or you
would not be allowed to go. _I_ shall be here, so you may be quite easy
about your aunt. And I hope you will have a very _agreeable_ day, and
find it all mighty _delightful_. But I must observe that five is the
very awkwardest of all possible numbers to sit down to table; and I
cannot but be surprised that such an _elegant_ lady as Mrs. Grant
should not contrive better! And round their enormous great wide table,
too, which fills up the room so dreadfully! Had the doctor been
contented to take my dining-table when I came away, as anybody in their
senses would have done, instead of having that absurd new one of his (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>)
own, which is wider, literally wider than the dinner-table here, how
infinitely better it would have been! and how much more he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) would have
been respected! for people are never respected when they step out of
their proper sphere. Remember that, Fanny. Five—only five to be sitting
round that table. However, you will have dinner enough on it for ten, I
dare say.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Norris fetched breath, and went on again.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>The nonsense and folly of people’s stepping out of their rank and
trying to appear above themselves, makes me think it right to give
_you_ a hint, Fanny, now that you are going into company without any of
us; and I do beseech and entreat you not to be putting yourself
forward, and talking and giving your opinion as if you were one of your
cousins—as if you were dear Mrs. Rushworth or Julia. _That_ will never
do, believe me. Remember, wherever you are, you must be the lowest and
last; and though Miss Crawford is in a manner at home at the Parsonage,
you are not to be taking place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). And as to coming away at night,
you are to stay just as long as Edmund chuses. Leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to settle
_that_."

<p/>"Yes, ma’am, I should not think of anything else."

<p/>"And if it should rain, which I think exceedingly likely, for I never
saw it more threatening for a wet evening in my life, you must manage
as well as you can, and not be expecting the carriage to be sent for
you. I certainly do not go home to-night, and, therefore, the carriage
will not be out on my account; so you must make up your mind to what
may happen, and take your things accordingly."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) niece thought it perfectly reasonable. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rated her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) own claims to
comfort as low even as Mrs. Norris could; and when Sir Thomas soon
afterwards, just opening the door, said, <div class="bookquote">"Fanny, at what time would you
have the carriage come round?"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt a degree of astonishment which
made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Sir Thomas!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris/Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Norris, red with anger, "Fanny can
walk."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Walk!"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>repeated Sir Thomas, in a tone of most unanswerable dignity,
and coming farther into the room. "My niece walk to a dinner engagement
at this time of the year! Will twenty minutes after four suit you?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>was Fanny’s humble answer, given with the feelings almost
of a criminal towards Mrs. Norris; and not bearing to remain with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
in what might seem a state of triumph, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle out of
the room, having staid behind him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) only long enough to hear these words
spoken in angry agitation—

<p/>"Quite unnecessary! a great deal too kind! But Edmund goes; true, it is
upon Edmund’s account. I observed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was hoarse on Thursday night."

<p/>But this could not impose on Fanny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that the carriage was for
herself, and herself alone: and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
coming immediately after such representations from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
some tears of gratitude when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was alone.

<p/>The coachman drove round to a minute; another minute brought down the
gentleman; and as the lady had, with a most scrupulous fear of being
late, been many minutes seated in the drawing-room, Sir Thomas saw them
off in as good time as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own correctly punctual habits required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now I must look at you, Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with the kind smile of an
affectionate brother, "and tell you how I like you; and as well as I
can judge by this light, you look very nicely indeed. What have you got
on?"

<p/>"The new dress that my uncle was so good as to give me on my cousin’s
marriage. I hope it is not too fine; but I thought I ought to wear it
as soon as I could, and that I might not have such another opportunity
all the winter. I hope you do not think me too fine."

<p/>"A woman can never be too fine while she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is all in white. No, I see no
finery about you; nothing but what is perfectly proper. Your gown seems
very pretty. I like these glossy spots. Has not Miss Crawford a gown
something the same?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>In approaching the Parsonage they passed close by the stable-yard and
coach-house.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Heyday!" said Edmund, "here’s company, here’s a carriage! who have
they got to meet us?" And letting down the side-glass to distinguish,
"’Tis Crawford’s, Crawford’s barouche, I protest! There are his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own two
men pushing it back into its old quarters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is here, of course. This
is quite a surprise, Fanny. I shall be very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)."

<p/>There was no occasion, there was no time for Fanny to say how very
differently she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt; but the idea of having such another to observe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a great increase of the trepidation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) performed
the very awful ceremony of walking into the drawing-room.

<p/>In the drawing-room Mr. Crawford certainly was, having been just long
enough arrived to be ready for dinner; and the smiles and pleased looks
of the three others standing round him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), shewed how welcome was his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sudden resolution of coming to them for a few days on leaving Bath. A
very cordial meeting passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and Edmund; and with the
exception of Fanny, the pleasure was general; and even to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ there
might be some advantage in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) presence, since every addition to the
party must rather forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) favourite indulgence of being suffered to
sit silent and unattended to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon aware of this herself; for
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must submit, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own propriety of mind directed, in spite
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris’s opinion, to being the principal lady in company,
and to all the little distinctions consequent thereon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found, while
they were at table, such a happy flow of conversation prevailing, in
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not required to take any part—there was so much to be
said between the brother and sister about Bath, so much between the two
young men about hunting, so much of politics between Mr. Crawford and
Dr. Grant, and of everything and all together between Mr. Crawford and
Mrs. Grant, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) the fairest prospect of having only to
listen in quiet, and of passing a very agreeable day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not
compliment the newly arrived gentleman, however, with any appearance of
interest, in a scheme for extending his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) stay at Mansfield, and sending
for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hunters from Norfolk, which, suggested by Dr. Grant, advised by
Edmund, and warmly urged by the two sisters, was soon in possession of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed to want to be encouraged even by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) to
resolve on. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) opinion was sought as to the probable continuance of
the open weather, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) answers were as short and indifferent as
civility allowed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to stay, and would much rather
not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) two absent cousins, especially Maria, were much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) thoughts on
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); but no embarrassing remembrance affected _his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ spirits.
Here he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was again on the same ground where all had passed before, and
apparently as willing to stay and be happy without the Miss Bertrams,
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had never known Mansfield in any other state. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heard them
spoken of by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) only in a general way, till they were all re-assembled
in the drawing-room, when Edmund, being engaged apart in some matter of
business with Dr. Grant, which seemed entirely to engross them, and
Mrs. Grant occupied at the tea-table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) began talking of them with
more particularity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) other sister. With a significant smile, which
made Fanny quite hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) said, "So! Rushworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fair bride
are at Brighton, I understand; happy man!"

<p/>"Yes, they have been there about a fortnight, Miss Price, have they
not? And Julia is with them."

<p/>"And Mr. Yates, I presume, is not far off.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Yates</b></font>)</div>Mr. Yates! Oh! we hear nothing of Mr. Yates. I do not imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
figures much in the letters to Mansfield Park; do you, Miss Price? I
think my friend Julia knows better than to entertain her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father with
Mr. Yates."

<p/>"Poor Rushworth and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) two-and-forty speeches!<div class="bookquote">" continued Crawford.
" (<font color='red'><b>Nobody</b></font>)</div>Nobody can ever forget them. Poor fellow! I see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now—his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) toil and
his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) despair. Well, I am much mistaken if his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) lovely Maria will ever
want him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) to make two-and-forty speeches to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)<div class="bookquote">"; adding, with a
momentary seriousness, " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is too good for him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)—much too good." And
then changing his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) tone again to one of gentle gallantry, and addressing
Fanny, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) said, "You were Mr. Rushworth’s best friend. Your kindness
and patience can never be forgotten, your indefatigable patience in
trying to make it possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) part—in trying to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a brain which nature had denied—to mix up an understanding for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
out of the superfluity of your own! _He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)_ might not have sense enough
himself to estimate your kindness, but I may venture to say that it had
honour from all the rest of the party.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny coloured, and said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It is as a dream, a pleasant dream!<div class="bookquote">" he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) exclaimed, breaking forth
again, after a few minutes’ musing. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I shall always look back on our
theatricals with exquisite pleasure. There was such an interest, such
an animation, such a spirit diffused. Everybody felt it. We were all
alive. There was employment, hope, solicitude, bustle, for every hour
of the day. Always some little objection, some little doubt, some
little anxiety to be got over. I never was happier."

<p/>With silent indignation Fanny repeated to herself, "Never
happier!—never happier than when doing what you must know was not
justifiable!—never happier than when behaving so dishonourably and
unfeelingly! Oh! what a corrupted mind!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We were unlucky, Miss Price,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) continued, in a lower tone, to avoid
the possibility of being heard by Edmund, and not at all aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
feelings, "we certainly were very unlucky. Another week, only one other
week, would have been enough for us. I think if we had had the disposal
of events—if Mansfield Park had had the government of the winds just
for a week or two, about the equinox, there would have been a
difference. Not that we would have endangered his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) safety by any
tremendous weather—but only by a steady contrary wind, or a calm. I
think, Miss Price, we would have indulged ourselves with a week’s calm
in the Atlantic at that season.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seemed determined to be answered; and Fanny, averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face,
said, with a firmer tone than usual, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>As far as _I_ am concerned, sir,
I would not have delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return for a day. My uncle disapproved it
all so entirely when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did arrive, that in my opinion everything had
gone quite far enough."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never spoken so much at once to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life before, and
never so angrily to any one; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) speech was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trembled
and blushed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own daring. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was surprised; but after a few
moments’ silent consideration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), replied in a calmer, graver tone,
and as if the candid result of conviction, "I believe you are right. It
was more pleasant than prudent. We were getting too noisy." And then
turning the conversation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would have engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on some other
subject, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answers were so shy and reluctant that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not
advance in any.

<p/>Miss Crawford, who had been repeatedly eyeing Dr. Grant and Edmund, now
observed, <div class="bookquote">"Those gentlemen must have some very interesting point to
discuss."

 (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"The most interesting in the world,"  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother—"how to make
money; how to turn a good income into a better. Dr. Grant is giving
Bertram instructions about the living he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) is to step into so soon. I
find he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) takes orders in a few weeks. They were at it in the
dining-parlour. I am glad to hear Bertram will be so well off. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) will
have a very pretty income to make ducks and drakes with, and earned
without much trouble. I apprehend he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) will not have less than seven
hundred a year. Seven hundred a year is a fine thing for a younger
brother; and as of course he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will still live at home, it will be all
for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) _menus_ _plaisirs_; and a sermon at Christmas and Easter, I
suppose, will be the sum total of sacrifice."

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister tried to laugh off her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) feelings by saying, "Nothing amuses
me more than the easy manner with which everybody settles the abundance
of those who have a great deal less than themselves. You would look
rather blank, Henry, if your _menus_ _plaisirs_ were to be limited to
seven hundred a year."

<p/>"Perhaps I might; but all _that_ you know is entirely comparative.
Birthright and habit must settle the business. Bertram is certainly
well off for a cadet of even a baronet’s family. By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) is four
or five and twenty he (<font color='blue'><b>cadet</b></font>) will have seven hundred a year, and nothing to do
for it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Crawford _could_ have said that there would be a something to do
and to suffer for it, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not think lightly of; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
checked herself and let it pass; and tried to look calm and unconcerned
when the two gentlemen shortly afterwards joined them.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>Bertram," said Henry Crawford, "I shall make a point of coming to
Mansfield to hear you preach your first sermon. I shall come on purpose
to encourage a young beginner. When is it to be? Miss Price, will not
you join me in encouraging your cousin? Will not you engage to attend
with your eyes steadily fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) the whole time—as I shall do—not
to lose a word; or only looking off just to note down any sentence
preeminently beautiful? We will provide ourselves with tablets and a
pencil. When will it be? You must preach at Mansfield, you know, that
Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram may hear you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall keep clear of you, Crawford, as long as I can,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund;
"for you would be more likely to disconcert me, and I should be more
sorry to see you trying at it than almost any other man."

<p/>"Will he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not feel this?<div class="bookquote">" thought Fanny. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can feel nothing as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
ought."

<p/>The party being now all united, and the chief talkers attracting each
other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remained in tranquillity; and as a whist-table was formed
after tea—formed really for the amusement of Dr. Grant, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
attentive wife, though it was not to be supposed so—and Miss Crawford
took her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) harp, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had nothing to do but to listen; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
tranquillity remained undisturbed the rest of the evening, except when
Mr. Crawford now and then addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a question or observation,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not avoid answering. Miss Crawford was too much vexed
by what had passed to be in a humour for anything but music. With that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) soothed herself and amused her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friend.

<p/>The assurance of Edmund’s being so soon to take orders, coming upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
like a blow that had been suspended, and still hoped uncertain and at a
distance, was felt with resentment and mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was very
angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) influence more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _had_ begun to
think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, with great regard, with almost
decided intentions; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would now meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own cool
feelings. It was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have no serious views, no true
attachment, by fixing himself in a situation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must know she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would never stoop to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would learn to match him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) indifference.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would henceforth admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attentions without any idea beyond
immediate amusement. If _he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ could so command his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) affections, _hers_
should do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) no harm.
