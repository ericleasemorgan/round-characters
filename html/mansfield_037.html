<p/>Mr. Crawford gone, Sir Thomas’s next object was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) should be
missed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entertained great hope that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece would find a blank
in the loss of those attentions which at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had felt, or
fancied, an evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had tasted of consequence in its most flattering
form; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did hope that the loss of it, the sinking again into
nothing, would awaken very wholesome regrets in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) watched
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) with this idea; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly tell with what success. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
hardly knew whether there were any difference in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) spirits or not.
She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was always so gentle and retiring that her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) emotions were beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
discrimination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not understand her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not; and
therefore applied to Edmund to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) stood affected on the
present occasion, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) were more or less happy than she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had
been.

<p/>Edmund did not discern any symptoms of regret, and thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father a
little unreasonable in supposing the first three or four days could
produce any.

<p/>What chiefly surprised Edmund was, that Crawford’s sister, the friend
and companion who had been so much to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), should not be more visibly
regretted. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) wondered that Fanny spoke so seldom of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_, and had so
little voluntarily to say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) concern at this separation.

<p/>Alas! it was this sister, this friend and companion, who was now the
chief bane of Fanny’s comfort. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have believed Mary’s future
fate as unconnected with Mansfield as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was determined the brother’s
should be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) return thither to be as distant
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was much inclined to think his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have been light of
heart indeed; but the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recollected and observed, the more
deeply was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) convinced that everything was now in a fairer train for
Miss Crawford’s marrying Edmund than it had ever been before. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
side the inclination was stronger, on hers less equivocal. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
objections, the scruples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) integrity, seemed all done away, nobody
could tell how; and the doubts and hesitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ambition were
equally got over—and equally without apparent reason. It could only be
imputed to increasing attachment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) bad feelings yielded
to love, and such love must unite them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was to go to town as soon as
some business relative to Thornton Lacey were completed—perhaps within
a fortnight; he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) talked of going, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) loved to talk of it; and when once
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again, Fanny could not doubt the rest. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acceptance must be
as certain as his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) offer; and yet there were bad feelings still
remaining which made the prospect of it most sorrowful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
independently, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed, independently of self.

<p/>In their very last conversation, Miss Crawford, in spite of some
amiable sensations, and much personal kindness, had still been Miss
Crawford; still shewn a mind led astray and bewildered, and without any
suspicion of being so; darkened, yet fancying itself light. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might
love, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not deserve Edmund by any other sentiment. Fanny
believed there was scarcely a second feeling in common between them;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may be forgiven by older sages for looking on the chance of
Miss Crawford’s future improvement as nearly desperate, for thinking
that if Edmund’s influence in this season of love had already done so
little in clearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) judgment, and regulating her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) notions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) worth
would be finally wasted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) even in years of matrimony.

<p/>Experience might have hoped more for any young people so circumstanced,
and impartiality would not have denied to Miss Crawford’s nature that
participation of the general nature of women which would lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to
adopt the opinions of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) loved and respected as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own. But
as such were Fanny’s persuasions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) suffered very much from them, and
could never speak of Miss Crawford without pain.

<p/>Sir Thomas, meanwhile, went on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own hopes and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
observations, still feeling a right, by all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) knowledge of human
nature, to expect to see the effect of the loss of power and
consequence on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece’s spirits, and the past attentions of the
lover producing a craving for their return; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was soon afterwards
able to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not yet completely and indubitably seeing all
this, by the prospect of another visitor, whose approach he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could allow
to be quite enough to support the spirits he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was watching. William had
obtained a ten days’ leave of absence, to be given to Northamptonshire,
and was coming, the happiest of lieutenants, because the latest made,
to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) happiness and describe his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came; and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have been delighted to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform there
too, had not cruel custom prohibited its appearance except on duty. So
the uniform remained at Portsmouth, and Edmund conjectured that before
Fanny had any chance of seeing it, all its own freshness and all the
freshness of its wearer’s feelings must be worn away. It would be sunk
into a badge of disgrace; for what can be more unbecoming, or more
worthless, than the uniform of a lieutenant, who has been a lieutenant
a year or two, and sees others made commanders before him (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>)? So reasoned
Edmund, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the confidant of a scheme which placed
Fanny’s chance of seeing the second lieutenant of H.M.S. Thrush in all
his (<font color='blue'><b>lieutenant</b></font>) glory in another light.

<p/>This scheme was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother back to
Portsmouth, and spend a little time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own family. It had
occurred to Sir Thomas, in one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dignified musings, as a right and
desirable measure; but before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) absolutely made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
consulted his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son. Edmund considered it every way, and saw nothing but
what was right. The thing was good in itself, and could not be done at
a better time; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had no doubt of it being highly agreeable to
Fanny. This was enough to determine Sir Thomas; and a decisive "then so
it shall be" closed that stage of the business; Sir Thomas retiring
from it with some feelings of satisfaction, and views of good over and
above what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) prime motive in
sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) away had very little to do with the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents again, and nothing at all with any idea of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) certainly wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to go willingly, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) as certainly
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be heartily sick of home before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visit ended; and that
a little abstinence from the elegancies and luxuries of Mansfield Park
would bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind into a sober state, and incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to a juster
estimate of the value of that home of greater permanence, and equal
comfort, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had the offer.

<p/>It was a medicinal project upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece’s understanding, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
must consider as at present diseased. A residence of eight or nine
years in the abode of wealth and plenty had a little disordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
powers of comparing and judging. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father’s house would, in all
probability, teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the value of a good income; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) trusted that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be the wiser and happier woman, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life, for the
experiment he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had devised.

<p/>Had Fanny been at all addicted to raptures, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have had a strong
attack of them when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first understood what was intended, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle first made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the offer of visiting the parents, and brothers,
and sisters, from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been divided almost half her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life; of
returning for a couple of months to the scenes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) infancy, with
William for the protector and companion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey, and the
certainty of continuing to see William to the last hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
remaining on land. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever given way to bursts of delight, it must
have been then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was delighted, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness was of a
quiet, deep, heart-swelling sort; and though never a great talker, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was always more inclined to silence when feeling most strongly. At the
moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could only thank and accept. Afterwards, when familiarised
with the visions of enjoyment so suddenly opened, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could speak more
largely to William and Edmund of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt; but still there were
emotions of tenderness that could not be clothed in words. The
remembrance of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) earliest pleasures, and of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had suffered
in being torn from them, came over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with renewed strength, and it
seemed as if to be at home again would heal every pain that had since
grown out of the separation. To be in the centre of such a circle,
loved by so many, and more loved by all than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever been before;
to feel affection without fear or restraint; to feel herself the equal
of those who surrounded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); to be at peace from all mention of the
Crawfords, safe from every look which could be fancied a reproach on
their account. This was a prospect to be dwelt on with a fondness that
could be but half acknowledged.

<p/>Edmund, too—to be two months from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ (and perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might be
allowed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence three) must do her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good. At a distance,
unassailed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looks or his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) kindness, and safe from the perpetual
irritation of knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart, and striving to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) confidence,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be able to reason herself into a properer state; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should
be able to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as in London, and arranging everything there,
without wretchedness. What might have been hard to bear at Mansfield
was to become a slight evil at Portsmouth.

<p/>The only drawback was the doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram’s being comfortable
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was of use to no one else; but _there_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) might be
missed to a degree that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) did not like to think of; and that part of
the arrangement was, indeed, the hardest for Sir Thomas to accomplish,
and what only _he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ could have accomplished at all.

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was master at Mansfield Park. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had really resolved on any
measure, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could always carry it through; and now by dint of long
talking on the subject, explaining and dwelling on the duty of Fanny’s
sometimes seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did induce his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) go;
obtaining it rather from submission, however, than conviction, for Lady
Bertram was convinced of very little more than that Sir Thomas thought
Fanny ought to go, and therefore that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must. In the calmness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own dressing-room, in the impartial flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own meditations,
unbiassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bewildering statements, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not acknowledge any
necessity for Fanny’s ever going near a father and mother who had done
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so long, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so useful to herself. And as to the
not missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which under Mrs. Norris’s discussion was the point
attempted to be proved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) set herself very steadily against admitting
any such thing.

<p/>Sir Thomas had appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) reason, conscience, and dignity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
called it a sacrifice, and demanded it of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) goodness and self-command
as such. But Mrs. Norris wanted to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) that Fanny could be
very well spared—_she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ being ready to give up all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
as requested—and, in short, could not really be wanted or missed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That may be, sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>was all Lady Bertram’s reply. <div class="bookquote">"I dare say you
are very right; but I am sure I shall miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) very much."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>The next step was to communicate with Portsmouth. Fanny wrote to offer
herself; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother’s answer, though short, was so kind—a few
simple lines expressed so natural and motherly a joy in the prospect of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child again, as to confirm all the daughter’s views of
happiness in being with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)—convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should now find a
warm and affectionate friend in the <div class="bookquote">"mama"  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>who had certainly shewn no
remarkable fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) formerly; but this she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could easily suppose
to have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own fault or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own fancy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had probably alienated
love by the helplessness and fretfulness of a fearful temper, or been
unreasonable in wanting a larger share than any one among so many could
deserve. Now, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew better how to be useful, and how to
forbear, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother could be no longer occupied by the
incessant demands of a house full of little children, there would be
leisure and inclination for every comfort, and they should soon be what
mother and daughter ought to be to each other.

<p/>William was almost as happy in the plan as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister. It would be the
greatest pleasure to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there to the last moment before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
sailed, and perhaps find her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there still when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) came in from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) first
cruise. And besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so very much to see the Thrush
before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went out of harbour—the Thrush was certainly the finest
sloop in the service—and there were several improvements in the
dockyard, too, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) quite longed to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) did not scruple to add that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) being at home for a while would be a
great advantage to everybody.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know how it is,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>); "but we seem to want some of your
nice ways and orderliness at my father’s. The house is always in
confusion. You will set things going in a better way, I am sure. You
will tell my mother how it all ought to be, and you will be so useful
to Susan, and you will teach Betsey, and make the boys love and mind
you. How right and comfortable it will all be!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>By the time Mrs. Price’s answer arrived, there remained but a very few
days more to be spent at Mansfield; and for part of one of those days
the young travellers were in a good deal of alarm on the subject of
their journey, for when the mode of it came to be talked of, and Mrs.
Norris found that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) anxiety to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) brother-in-law’s money
was vain, and that in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) wishes and hints for a less
expensive conveyance of Fanny, they were to travel post; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw
Sir Thomas actually give William notes for the purpose, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was struck
with the idea of there being room for a third in the carriage, and
suddenly seized with a strong inclination to go with them, to go and
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor dear sister Price. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) proclaimed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must
say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had more than half a mind to go with the young people; it
would be such an indulgence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor dear
sister Price for more than twenty years; and it would be a help to the
young people in their journey to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) older head to manage for
them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help thinking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) poor dear sister Price would
feel it very unkind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to come by such an opportunity.

<p/>William and Fanny were horror-struck at the idea.

<p/>All the comfort of their comfortable journey would be destroyed at
once. With woeful countenances they looked at each other. Their
suspense lasted an hour or two. No one interfered to encourage or
dissuade. Mrs. Norris was left to settle the matter by herself; and it
ended, to the infinite joy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nephew and niece, in the recollection
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not possibly be spared from Mansfield Park at present;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was a great deal too necessary to Sir Thomas and Lady Bertram
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to be able to answer it to herself to leave them even for a
week, and therefore must certainly sacrifice every other pleasure to
that of being useful to them.

<p/>It had, in fact, occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), that though taken to Portsmouth for
nothing, it would be hardly possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to avoid paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own
expenses back again. So her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) poor dear sister Price was left to all the
disappointment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) missing such an opportunity, and another twenty
years’ absence, perhaps, begun.

<p/>Edmund’s plans were affected by this Portsmouth journey, this absence
of Fanny’s. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too had a sacrifice to make to Mansfield Park as well as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) aunt. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had intended, about this time, to be going to London; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father and mother just when everybody else of
most importance to their comfort was leaving them; and with an effort,
felt but not boasted of, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) delayed for a week or two longer a journey
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was looking forward to with the hope of its fixing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
happiness for ever.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) told Fanny of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew so much already, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must know
everything. It made the substance of one other confidential discourse
about Miss Crawford; and Fanny was the more affected from feeling it to
be the last time in which Miss Crawford’s name would ever be mentioned
between them with any remains of liberty. Once afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
alluded to by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). Lady Bertram had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) niece in the
evening to write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) soon and often, and promising to be a good
correspondent herself; and Edmund, at a convenient moment, then added
in a whisper, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And _I_ shall write to you, Fanny, when I have anything
worth writing about, anything to say that I think you will like to
hear, and that you will not hear so soon from any other quarter." Had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) meaning while she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) listened, the glow in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) face, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked up at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), would have been decisive.

<p/>For this letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must try to arm herself. That a letter from Edmund
should be a subject of terror! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not yet
gone through all the changes of opinion and sentiment which the
progress of time and variation of circumstances occasion in this world
of changes. The vicissitudes of the human mind had not yet been
exhausted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Poor Fanny! though going as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did willingly and eagerly, the last
evening at Mansfield Park must still be wretchedness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was
completely sad at parting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had tears for every room in the house,
much more for every beloved inhabitant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) clung to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kissed the hand of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle with struggling
sobs, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had displeased him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); and as for Edmund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
neither speak, nor look, nor think, when the last moment came with
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_; and it was not till it was over that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
the affectionate farewell of a brother.

<p/>All this passed overnight, for the journey was to begin very early in
the morning; and when the small, diminished party met at breakfast,
William and Fanny were talked of as already advanced one stage.
