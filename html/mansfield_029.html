<p/>The ball was over, and the breakfast was soon over too; the last kiss
was given, and William was gone. Mr. Crawford had, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) foretold, been
very punctual, and short and pleasant had been the meal.

<p/>After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the
breakfast-room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy
change; and there her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle kindly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to cry in peace,
conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might
exercise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones
and mustard in William’s plate might but divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings with the
broken egg-shells in Mr. Crawford’s. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat and cried _con_ _amore_ as
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle intended, but it was _con_ _amore_ fraternal and no other.
William was gone, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now felt as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had wasted half his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) visit
in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Fanny’s disposition was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never even think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt Norris in the meagreness and cheerlessness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own small house,
without reproaching herself for some little want of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
when they had been last together; much less could her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings acquit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of having done and said and thought everything by William that was
due to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for a whole fortnight.

<p/>It was a heavy, melancholy day. Soon after the second breakfast, Edmund
bade them good-bye for a week, and mounted his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) horse for Peterborough,
and then all were gone. Nothing remained of last night but
remembrances, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nobody to share in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Bertram—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must talk to somebody of the ball; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt had seen so
little of what had passed, and had so little curiosity, that it was
heavy work. Lady Bertram was not certain of anybody’s dress or
anybody’s place at supper but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own. <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not recollect what it
was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had heard about one of the Miss Maddoxes, or what it was
that Lady Prescott had noticed in Fanny: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not sure whether
Colonel Harrison had been talking of Mr. Crawford or of William when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
said he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was the finest young man in the room—somebody had whispered
something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had forgot to ask Sir Thomas what it could be."
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And these were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longest speeches and clearest communications: the
rest was only a languid "Yes, yes; very well; did you? did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)? I did
not see _that_; I should not know one from the other." This was very
bad. It was only better than Mrs. Norris’s sharp answers would have
been; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being gone home with all the supernumerary jellies to
nurse a sick maid, there was peace and good-humour in their little
party, though it could not boast much beside.

<p/>The evening was heavy like the day. <div class="bookquote">"I cannot think what is the matter
with me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, when the tea-things were removed. "I feel
quite stupid. It must be sitting up so late last night. Fanny, you must
do something to keep me awake. I cannot work. Fetch the cards; I feel
so very stupid."

<p/>The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt till
bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard
in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the
game—"And _that_ makes thirty-one; four in hand and eight in crib. You
are to deal, ma’am; shall I deal for you?" Fanny thought and thought
again of the difference which twenty-four hours had made in that room,
and all that part of the house. Last night it had been hope and smiles,
bustle and motion, noise and brilliancy, in the drawing-room, and out
of the drawing-room, and everywhere. Now it was languor, and all but
solitude.

<p/>A good night’s rest improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of William
the next day more cheerfully; and as the morning afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) an
opportunity of talking over Thursday night with Mrs. Grant and Miss
Crawford, in a very handsome style, with all the heightenings of
imagination, and all the laughs of playfulness which are so essential
to the shade of a departed ball, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could afterwards bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind
without much effort into its everyday state, and easily conform to the
tranquillity of the present quiet week.

<p/>They were indeed a smaller party than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ever known there for a
whole day together, and _he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ was gone on whom the comfort and
cheerfulness of every family meeting and every meal chiefly depended.
But this must be learned to be endured. He (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would soon be always gone;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was thankful that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could now sit in the same room with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
uncle, hear his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) voice, receive his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) questions, and even answer them,
without such wretched feelings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had formerly known.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We miss our two young men,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>was Sir Thomas’s observation on both the
first and second day, as they formed their very reduced circle after
dinner; and in consideration of Fanny’s swimming eyes, nothing more was
said on the first day than to drink their good health; but on the
second it led to something farther. William was kindly commended and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) promotion hoped for. "And there is no reason to suppose,<div class="bookquote">" added Sir
Thomas, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but that his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) visits to us may now be tolerably frequent. As to
Edmund, we must learn to do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). This will be the last winter
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) belonging to us, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) has done."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, "but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not going away. They are
all going away, I think. I wish they would stay at home."

<p/>This wish was levelled principally at Julia, who had just applied for
permission to go to town with Maria; and as Sir Thomas thought it best
for each daughter that the permission should be granted, Lady Bertram,
though in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own good-nature she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would not have prevented it, was
lamenting the change it made in the prospect of Julia’s return, which
would otherwise have taken place about this time. A great deal of good
sense followed on Sir Thomas’s side, tending to reconcile his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife to
the arrangement. Everything that a considerate parent _ought_ to feel
was advanced for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) use; and everything that an affectionate mother
_must_ feel in promoting her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) children’s enjoyment was attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
nature. Lady Bertram agreed to it all with a calm <div class="bookquote">"Yes" (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>; and at the end
of a quarter of an hour’s silent consideration spontaneously observed,
"Sir Thomas, I have been thinking—and I am very glad we took Fanny as
we did, for now the others are away we feel the good of it."

<p/>Sir Thomas immediately improved this compliment by adding, "Very true.
We shew Fanny what a good girl we think her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) by praising her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is now a very valuable companion. If we have been kind to
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is now quite as necessary to _us_."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram presently; "and it is a comfort to think that
we shall always have _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_."

<p/>Sir Thomas paused, half smiled, glanced at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and then gravely
replied, "She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) will never leave us, I hope, till invited to some other
home that may reasonably promise her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) greater happiness than she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) knows
here."

<p/>"And _that_ is not very likely to be, Sir Thomas. Who should invite
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)? Maria might be very glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) at Sotherton now and then, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) would not think of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) to live there; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) is
better off here; and besides, I cannot do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)."

<p/>The week which passed so quietly and peaceably at the great house in
Mansfield had a very different character at the Parsonage. To the young
lady, at least, in each family, it brought very different feelings.
What was tranquillity and comfort to Fanny was tediousness and vexation
to Mary. Something arose from difference of disposition and habit: one
so easily satisfied, the other so unused to endure; but still more
might be imputed to difference of circumstances. In some points of
interest they were exactly opposed to each other. To Fanny’s mind,
Edmund’s absence was really, in its cause and its tendency, a relief.
To Mary it was every way painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt the want of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) society
every day, almost every hour, and was too much in want of it to derive
anything but irritation from considering the object for which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) went.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not have devised anything more likely to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) consequence
than this week’s absence, occurring as it did at the very time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
brother’s going away, of William Price’s going too, and completing the
sort of general break-up of a party which had been so animated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
felt it keenly. They were now a miserable trio, confined within doors
by a series of rain and snow, with nothing to do and no variety to hope
for. Angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was with Edmund for adhering to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own notions, and
acting on them in defiance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) (and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been so angry that they
had hardly parted friends at the ball), she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help thinking of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continually when absent, dwelling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) merit and affection, and
longing again for the almost daily meetings they lately had. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
absence was unnecessarily long. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should not have planned such an
absence—he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should not have left home for a week, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own departure
from Mansfield was so near. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to blame herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had not spoken so warmly in their last conversation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was afraid
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had used some strong, some contemptuous expressions in speaking of
the clergy, and that should not have been. It was ill-bred; it was
wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wished such words unsaid with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) heart.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) vexation did not end with the week. All this was bad, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
still more to feel when Friday came round again and brought no Edmund;
when Saturday came and still no Edmund; and when, through the slight
communication with the other family which Sunday produced, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) learned
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had actually written home to defer his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return, having promised
to remain some days longer with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend.

<p/>If she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had felt impatience and regret before—if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had been sorry for
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) said, and feared its too strong effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)—she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now felt and
feared it all tenfold more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had, moreover, to contend with one
disagreeable emotion entirely new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)—jealousy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend Mr. Owen
had sisters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>) might find them attractive. But, at any rate, his (<font color='blue'><b>Owen</b></font>)
staying away at a time when, according to all preceding plans, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
to remove to London, meant something that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not bear. Had Henry
returned, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) talked of doing, at the end of three or four days, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
should now have been leaving Mansfield. It became absolutely necessary
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to get to Fanny and try to learn something more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not
live any longer in such solitary wretchedness; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) way to
the Park, through difficulties of walking which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had deemed
unconquerable a week before, for the chance of hearing a little in
addition, for the sake of at least hearing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) name.

<p/>The first half-hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together,
and unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had Fanny to herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could hope for nothing. But at
last Lady Bertram left the room, and then almost immediately Miss
Crawford thus began, with a voice as well regulated as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could—"And
how do _you_ like your cousin Edmund’s staying away so long? Being the
only young person at home, I consider _you_ as the greatest sufferer.
You must miss him (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>). Does his (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) staying longer surprise you?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny hesitatingly. "Yes; I had not particularly
expected it."

<p/>"Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) will always stay longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) talks of. It is the general
way all young men do."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) did not, the only time he (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) went to see Mr. Owen before."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) finds the house more agreeable _now_. He (<font color='blue'><b>sufferer</b></font>) is a very—a very pleasing
young man himself, and I cannot help being rather concerned at not
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again before I go to London, as will now undoubtedly be the
case. I am looking for Henry every day, and as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) comes there
will be nothing to detain me at Mansfield. I should like to have seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) once more, I confess. But you must give my compliments to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Yes;
I think it must be compliments. Is not there a something wanted, Miss
Price, in our language—a something between compliments and—and love—to
suit the sort of friendly acquaintance we have had together? So many
months’ acquaintance! But compliments may be sufficient here. Was his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
letter a long one? Does he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) give you much account of what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is doing?
Is it Christmas gaieties that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is staying for?"

<p/>"I only heard a part of the letter; it was to my uncle; but I believe
it was very short; indeed I am sure it was but a few lines. All that I
heard was that his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) friend had pressed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to stay longer, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
had agreed to do so. A _few_ days longer, or _some_ days longer; I am
not quite sure which."

<p/>"Oh! if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) father; but I thought it might have been to
Lady Bertram or you. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) wrote to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) father, no wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
concise. Who could write chat to Sir Thomas? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had written to you,
there would have been more particulars. You would have heard of balls
and parties. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would have sent you a description of everything and
everybody. How many Miss Owens are there?"

<p/>"Three grown up."

<p/>"Are they musical?"

<p/>"I do not at all know. I never heard."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is the first question, you know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, trying to
appear gay and unconcerned, "which every woman who plays herself is
sure to ask about another. But it is very foolish to ask questions
about any young ladies—about any three sisters just grown up; for one
knows, without being told, exactly what they are: all very accomplished
and pleasing, and one very pretty. There is a beauty in every family;
it is a regular thing. Two play on the pianoforte, and one on the harp;
and all sing, or would sing if they were taught, or sing all the better
for not being taught; or something like it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know nothing of the Miss Owens,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny calmly.

<p/>"You know nothing and you care less, as people say. Never did tone
express indifference plainer. Indeed, how can one care for those one
has never seen? Well, when your cousin comes back, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) will find
Mansfield very quiet; all the noisy ones gone, your brother and mine
and myself. I do not like the idea of leaving Mrs. Grant now the time
draws near. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) does not like my going.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny felt obliged to speak. " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You cannot doubt your being missed by
many," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). "You will be very much missed."

<p/>Miss Crawford turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as if wanting to hear or see more,
and then laughingly said, "Oh yes! missed as every noisy evil is missed
when it is taken away; that is, there is a great difference felt. But I
am not fishing; don’t compliment me. If I _am_ missed, it will appear.
I may be discovered by those who want to see me. I shall not be in any
doubtful, or distant, or unapproachable region.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Now Fanny could not bring herself to speak, and Miss Crawford was
disappointed; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had hoped to hear some pleasant assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
power from one who she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought must know, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits were clouded
again.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Owens</b></font>)</div>The Miss Owens," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Owens</b></font>), soon afterwards; "suppose you were to have
one of the Miss Owens settled at Thornton Lacey; how should you like
it? Stranger things have happened. I dare say they are trying for it.
And they are quite in the right, for it would be a very pretty
establishment for them. I do not at all wonder or blame them. It is
everybody’s duty to do as well for themselves as they can. Sir Thomas
Bertram’s son is somebody; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) is in their own line. Their
father is a clergyman, and their brother is a clergyman, and they are
all clergymen together. He (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) is their lawful property; he (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) fairly belongs
to them. You don’t speak, Fanny; Miss Price, you don’t speak. But
honestly now, do not you rather expect it than otherwise?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny stoutly, "I do not expect it at all."

<p/>"Not at all!<div class="bookquote">" cried Miss Crawford with alacrity. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wonder at that. But
I dare say you know exactly—I always imagine you are—perhaps you do not
think him (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) likely to marry at all—or not at present."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, I do not,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny softly, hoping she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not err either in the
belief or the acknowledgment of it.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) companion looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) keenly; and gathering greater spirit from
the blush soon produced from such a look, only said, <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is best off as
he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is,"  (<font color='red'><b>companion</b></font>)</div>and turned the subject.
