<p/>Two days after Mr. Bennet’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were
walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the
housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) came to
call them to their mother, went forward to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>); but, instead
of the expected summons, when they approached her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) said to
Miss Bennet, <div class="bookquote">"I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but
I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I
took the liberty of coming to ask."

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>"What do you mean, Hill? We have heard nothing from town."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Hill/Mrs. Hill</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Hill, in great astonishment, "don’t you
know there is an express come for master from Mr. Gardiner? He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
has been here this half-hour, and master has had a letter."

<p/>Away ran the girls, too eager to get in to have time for speech.
They ran through the vestibule into the breakfast-room; from
thence to the library; their father was in neither; and they were
on the point of seeking him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) up stairs with their mother, when
they were met by the butler, who said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you are looking for my master, ma’am, he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is walking towards
the little copse."

 (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div><p/>Upon this information, they instantly passed through the hall
once more, and ran across the lawn after their father, who was
deliberately pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) way towards a small wood on one side of
the paddock.

<p/>Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as
Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, panting for
breath, came up with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and eagerly cried out:

<p/>"Oh, papa, what news—what news? Have you heard from my uncle?"

<p/>"Yes I have had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) by express."

<p/>"Well, and what news does it bring—good or bad?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What is there of good to be expected?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), taking the
letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket. "But perhaps you would like to read it."

<p/>Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) hand. Jane now came up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Read it aloud,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said their father, "for I hardly know myself
what it is about."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Gracechurch Street, _Monday, August_ 2.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Brother</b></font>)</div>My dear Brother,
"At last I am able to send you some tidings of my niece, and such
as, upon the whole, I hope it will give you satisfaction. Soon
after you left me on Saturday, I was fortunate enough to find out
in what part of London they were. The particulars I reserve till
we meet; it is enough to know they are discovered. I have seen
them both—"
"Then it is as I always hoped," cried Jane; "they are
married!"

<p/>Elizabeth read on:

<p/>"I have seen them both. They are not married, nor can I find
there was any intention of being so; but if you are willing to
perform the engagements which I have ventured to make on your
side, I hope it will not be long before they are. All that is
required of you is, to assure to your daughter, by settlement,
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your
children after the decease of yourself and my sister; and,
moreover, to enter into an engagement of allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), during
your life, one hundred pounds per annum. These are conditions
which, considering everything, I had no hesitation in complying
with, as far as I thought myself privileged, for you. I shall
send this by express, that no time may be lost in bringing me
your answer. You will easily comprehend, from these particulars,
that Mr. Wickham’s circumstances are not so hopeless as they are
generally believed to be. The world has been deceived in that
respect; and I am happy to say there will be some little money,
even when all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) debts are discharged, to settle on my niece, in
addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own fortune. If, as I conclude will be the case,
you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole
of this business, I will immediately give directions to
Haggerston for preparing a proper settlement. There will not be
the smallest occasion for your coming to town again; therefore
stay quiet at Longbourn, and depend on my diligence and care.
Send back your answer as fast as you can, and be careful to write
explicitly. We have judged it best that my niece should be
married from this house, of which I hope you will approve. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
comes to us to-day. I shall write again as soon as anything more
is determined on. Yours, etc.,

<p/>"EDW. GARDINER."

<p/>"Is it possible?<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had finished. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Can it
be possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>GARDINER</b></font>) will marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister. "My dear father, I congratulate you."

<p/>"And have you answered the letter?<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No; but it must be done soon.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to lose no more time
before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! my dear father," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cried, "come back and write
immediately. Consider how important every moment is in such a
case."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Let me write for you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, "if you dislike the trouble
yourself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I dislike it very much,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied; "but it must be done.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) turned back with them, and walked towards the
house.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And may I ask—" said Elizabeth; "but the terms, I suppose, must
be complied with."

<p/>"Complied with! I am only ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) asking so little."

<p/>"And they _must_ marry! Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is _such_ a man!"

<p/>"Yes, yes, they must marry. There is nothing else to be done. But
there are two things that I want very much to know; one is, how
much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about; and the
other, how am I ever to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)."

<p/>"Money! My uncle!" cried Jane, "what do you mean, sir?"

<p/>"I mean, that no man in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses would marry Lydia on so slight
a temptation as one hundred a year during my life, and fifty
after I am gone."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; "though it had not occurred
to me before. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) debts to be discharged, and something still to
remain! Oh! it must be my uncle’s doings! Generous, good man, I
am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has distressed himself. A small sum could not do all
this."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>father Wickham</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father; "Wickham’s a fool if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) takes her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with a
farthing less than ten thousand pounds. I should be sorry to
think so ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), in the very beginning of our relationship."

<p/>"Ten thousand pounds! Heaven forbid! How is half such a sum to be
repaid?"

<p/>Mr. Bennet made no answer, and each of them, deep in thought,
continued silent till they reached the house. Their father then
went on to the library to write, and the girls walked into the
breakfast-room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And they are really to be married!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, as soon as
they were by themselves. "How strange this is! And for _this_ we
are to be thankful. That they should marry, small as is their
chance of happiness, and wretched as is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) character, we are
forced to rejoice. Oh, Lydia!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I comfort myself with thinking,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
certainly would not marry Lydia if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not a real regard for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). Though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), I cannot believe that ten thousand pounds, or anything like
it, has been advanced. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has children of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own, and may have
more. How could he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spare half ten thousand pounds?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were ever able to learn what Wickham’s debts have been,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "and how much is settled on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side on our
sister, we shall exactly know what Mr. Gardiner has done for
them, because Wickham has not sixpence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own. The kindness
of my uncle and aunt can never be requited. Their taking her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
home, and affording her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) their personal protection and
countenance, is such a sacrifice to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) advantage as years of
gratitude cannot enough acknowledge. By this time she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is actually
with them! If such goodness does not make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) miserable now, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
will never deserve to be happy! What a meeting for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
first sees my aunt!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane: "I hope and trust they will yet be happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
consenting to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is a proof, I will believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is
come to a right way of thinking. Their mutual affection will
steady them; and I flatter myself they will settle so quietly,
and live in so rational a manner, as may in time make their past
imprudence forgotten."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Their conduct has been such,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, "as neither
you, nor I, nor anybody can ever forget. It is useless to talk of
it."

<p/>It now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all
likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened. They went to
the library, therefore, and asked their father whether he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would
not wish them to make it known to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was writing and,
without raising his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, coolly replied:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Just as you please."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"May we take my uncle’s letter to read to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Take whatever you like, and get away."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth took the letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) writing-table, and they went
up stairs together. Mary and Kitty were both with Mrs. Bennet:
one communication would, therefore, do for all. After a slight
preparation for good news, the letter was read aloud. Mrs. Bennet
could hardly contain herself. As soon as Jane had read Mr.
Gardiner’s hope of Lydia’s being soon married, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) joy burst
forth, and every following sentence added to its exuberance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
was now in an irritation as violent from delight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had ever
been fidgety from alarm and vexation. To know that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) daughter
would be married was enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was disturbed by no fear for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
felicity, nor humbled by any remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) misconduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear, dear Lydia!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried. "This is delightful indeed! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
will be married! I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) again! She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will be married at
sixteen! My good, kind brother! I knew how it would be. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would manage everything! How I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)! and to see dear
Wickham too! But the clothes, the wedding clothes! I will write
to my sister Gardiner about them directly. Lizzy, my dear, run
down to your father, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>). Stay,
stay, I will go myself. Ring the bell, Kitty, for Hill. I will
put on my things in a moment. My dear, dear Lydia! How merry we
shall be together when we meet!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) eldest daughter endeavoured to give some relief to the
violence of these transports, by leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) thoughts to the
obligations which Mr. Gardiner’s behaviour laid them all under.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For we must attribute this happy conclusion," she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, "in a
great measure to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) kindness. We are persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) has
pledged himself to assist Mr. Wickham with money."

<p/>"Well,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother, " (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>it is all very right; who should do it
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own uncle? If he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had not had a family of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own, I and
my children must have had all his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) money, you know; and it is the
first time we have ever had anything from him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), except a few
presents. Well! I am so happy! In a short time I shall have a
daughter married. Mrs. Wickham! How well it sounds! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was
only sixteen last June. My dear Jane, I am in such a flutter,
that I am sure I can’t write; so I will dictate, and you write
for me. We will settle with your father about the money
afterwards; but the things should be ordered immediately."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico, muslin,
and cambric, and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful
orders, had not Jane, though with some difficulty, persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
to wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) father was at leisure to be consulted. One day’s
delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) observed, would be of small importance; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother
was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual. Other schemes,
too, came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will go to Meryton,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "as soon as I am dressed, and
tell the good, good news to my sister Philips. And as I come
back, I can call on Lady Lucas and Mrs. Long. Kitty, run down and
order the carriage. An airing would do me a great deal of good, I
am sure. Girls, can I do anything for you in Meryton? Oh! Here
comes Hill! My dear Hill, have you heard the good news? Miss
Lydia is going to be married; and you shall all have a bowl of
punch to make merry at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wedding."

<p/>Mrs. Hill began instantly to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Hill</b></font>) joy. Elizabeth received
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this
folly, took refuge in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might think with
freedom.

<p/>Poor Lydia’s situation must, at best, be bad enough; but that it
was no worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had need to be thankful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) felt it so; and
though, in looking forward, neither rational happiness nor
worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sister, in
looking back to what they had feared, only two hours ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
felt all the advantages of what they had gained.
