<p/>Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma’s
opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could
not think that Harriet’s solace or her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own sins required more; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they
returned;—but it burst out again when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had succeeded,
and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter,
and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive—"Mr. Elton is so
good to the poor!" she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found something else must be done.

<p/>They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was
always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates
loved to be called on, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was considered by the very few
who presumed ever to see imperfection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), as rather negligent in
that respect, and as not contributing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) ought to the stock of
their scanty comforts.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own heart,
as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) deficiency—but none were equal to counteract the persuasion
of its being very disagreeable,—a waste of time—tiresome women—and all
the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and
third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and
therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seldom went near them. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) made the sudden
resolution of not passing their door without going in—observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could calculate, they were
just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.

<p/>The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied
the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized
apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most
cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who
with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to
give up her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) place to Miss Woodhouse, and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more active, talking
daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks
for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after
Mr. Woodhouse’s health, cheerful communications about her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) mother’s, and
sweet-cake from the beaufet—<div class="bookquote">"Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called
in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
liked it very much; and, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss
Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/>The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton.
There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton
since his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the
letter over again, and settle how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had been gone, and how much
he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was engaged in company, and what a favourite he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies’ ball had been; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
went through it very well, with all the interest and all the
commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to
prevent Harriet’s being obliged to say a word.

<p/>This she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been prepared for when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) entered the house; but meant,
having once talked him (<font color='blue'><b>Master</b></font>) handsomely over, to be no farther incommoded by
any troublesome topic, and to wander at large amongst all the
Mistresses and Misses of Highbury, and their card-parties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not
been prepared to have Jane Fairfax succeed Mr. Elton; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was
actually hurried off by Miss Bates, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) jumped away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at last
abruptly to the Coles, to usher in a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece.

<p/>"Oh! yes—Mr. Elton, I understand—certainly as to dancing—Mrs. Cole was
telling me that dancing at the rooms at Bath was—Mrs. Cole was so kind
as to sit some time with us, talking of Jane; for as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came
in, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began inquiring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), Jane is so very great a favourite
there. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any
body can. And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) began inquiring after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) directly, saying, <div class="bookquote">‘I
know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) time
for writing;’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and when I immediately said, <div class="bookquote">‘But indeed we have, we had
a letter this very morning,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not know that I ever saw any body
more surprized. <div class="bookquote">‘Have you, upon your honour?’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">‘well, that is
quite unexpected. Do let me hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says.’ (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>Emma’s politeness was at hand directly, to say, with smiling interest—

<p/>"Have you heard from Miss Fairfax so lately? I am extremely happy. I
hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is well?"

<p/>"Thank you. You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt, while
eagerly hunting for the letter.—"Oh! here it is. I was sure it could
not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without
being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very
lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it
to Mrs. Cole, and since she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went away, I was reading it again to my
mother, for it is such a pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)—a letter from Jane—that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and
here it is, only just under my huswife—and since you are so kind as to
wish to hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says;—but, first of all, I really must, in
justice to Jane, apologise for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) writing so short a letter—only two
pages you see—hardly two—and in general she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fills the whole paper and
crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well.
She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) often says, when the letter is first opened, <div class="bookquote">‘Well, Hetty, now I
think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work’ (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>—don’t
you, ma’am?—And then I tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>), I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would contrive to make
it out herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had nobody to do it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>)—every word of it—I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) would pore over it till she (<font color='blue'><b>Hetty</b></font>) had made out every word. And,
indeed, though my mother’s eyes are not so good as they were, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can
see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is
such a blessing! My mother’s are really very good indeed. Jane often
says, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is here, <div class="bookquote">‘I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very
strong eyes to see as you do—and so much fine work as you have done
too!—I only wish my eyes may last me as well.’ (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"

<p/>All this spoken extremely fast obliged Miss Bates to stop for breath;
and Emma said something very civil about the excellence of Miss
Fairfax’s handwriting.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates</b></font>)</div>You are extremely kind," replied Miss Bates, highly gratified; "you
who are such a judge, and write so beautifully yourself. I am sure
there is nobody’s praise that could give us so much pleasure as Miss
Woodhouse’s. My mother does not hear; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is a little deaf you know.
Ma’am," addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), "do you hear what Miss Woodhouse is so obliging
to say about Jane’s handwriting?"

<p/>And Emma had the advantage of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own silly compliment repeated
twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was
pondering, in the meanwhile, upon the possibility, without seeming very
rude, of making her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) escape from Jane Fairfax’s letter, and had almost
resolved on hurrying away directly under some slight excuse, when Miss
Bates turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) again and seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) attention.

<p/>"My mother’s deafness is very trifling you see—just nothing at all. By
only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is sure to hear; but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is used to my voice. But it is very
remarkable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) should always hear Jane better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does me.
Jane speaks so distinct! However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will not find her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmama at
all deafer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at
my mother’s time of life—and it really is full two years, you know,
since she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was here. We never were so long without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) before,
and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) now."

<p/>"Are you expecting Miss Fairfax here soon?"

<p/>"Oh yes; next week."

<p/>"Indeed!—that must be a very great pleasure."

<p/>"Thank you. You are very kind. Yes, next week. Every body is so
surprized; and every body says the same obliging things. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>)
will be as happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) friends at Highbury, as they can be to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>). Yes, Friday or Saturday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) cannot say which, because Colonel
Campbell will be wanting the carriage himself one of those days. So
very good of them to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) the whole way! But they always do, you
know. Oh yes, Friday or Saturday next. That is what she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writes about.
That is the reason of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) writing out of rule, as we call it; for, in
the common course, we should not have heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) before next
Tuesday or Wednesday."

<p/>"Yes, so I imagined. I was afraid there could be little chance of my
hearing any thing of Miss Fairfax to-day."

<p/>"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been
for this particular circumstance, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) being to come here so soon. My
mother is so delighted!—for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is to be three months with us at least.
Three months, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says so, positively, as I am going to have the
pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells
are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father and mother to
come over and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) directly. They had not intended to go over till
the summer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is so impatient to see them again—for till she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)
married, last October, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was never away from them so much as a week,
which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was
going to say, but however different countries, and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wrote a very
urgent letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) mother—or her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father, I declare I do not know
which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane’s letter—wrote in Mr.
Dixon’s name as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own, to press their coming over directly,
and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to
their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has
heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean—I do not know
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very
natural, you know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) should like to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own place while
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) addresses—and as Jane used to be very often walking
out with them—for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about
their daughter’s not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I
do not at all blame them; of course she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) heard every thing he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) might be
telling Miss Campbell about his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) own home in Ireland; and I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)
wrote us word that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had shewn them some drawings of the place, views
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had taken himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is a most amiable, charming young man, I
believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) account of
things.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>At this moment, an ingenious and animating suspicion entering Emma’s
brain with regard to Jane Fairfax, this charming Mr. Dixon, and the not
going to Ireland, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) said, with the insidious design of farther
discovery,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You must feel it very fortunate that Miss Fairfax should be allowed to
come to you at such a time. Considering the very particular friendship
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) and Mrs. Dixon, you could hardly have expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be
excused from accompanying Colonel and Mrs. Campbell."

<p/>"Very true, very true, indeed. The very thing that we have always been
rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) at such a
distance from us, for months together—not able to come if any thing was
to happen. But you see, every thing turns out for the best. They want
her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs.
Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing
than their joint invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently;
Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is a
most charming young man. Ever since the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) rendered Jane at
Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), by
the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would
have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
habit— (I can never think of it without trembling!)—But ever since we
had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"

<p/>"But, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friends’ urgency, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own wish of seeing
Ireland, Miss Fairfax prefers devoting the time to you and Mrs. Bates?"

<p/>"Yes—entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own doing, entirely her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own choice; and Colonel and
Mrs. Campbell think she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) does quite right, just what they should
recommend; and indeed they particularly wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native
air, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has not been quite so well as usual lately."

<p/>"I am concerned to hear of it. I think they judge wisely. But Mrs.
Dixon must be very much disappointed. Mrs. Dixon, I understand, has no
remarkable degree of personal beauty; is not, by any means, to be
compared with Miss Fairfax."

<p/>"Oh! no. You are very obliging to say such things—but certainly not.
There is no comparison between them. Miss Campbell always was
absolutely plain—but extremely elegant and amiable."

<p/>"Yes, that of course."

<p/>"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of
November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well
since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) never
mentioned it before, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not alarm us. Just like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)! so
considerate!—But however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is so far from well, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) kind
friends the Campbells think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had better come home, and try an air
that always agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); and they have no doubt that three or four
months at Highbury will entirely cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)—and it is certainly a great
deal better that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should come here, than go to Ireland, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is
unwell. Nobody could nurse her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), as we should do."

<p/>"It appears to me the most desirable arrangement in the world."

<p/>"And so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells
leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following—as you will
find from Jane’s letter. So sudden!—You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse,
what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) illness—but I am afraid we must expect to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grown thin, and
looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to
me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane’s letters through
to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for
fear of there being any thing in them to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Jane desired me
to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution;
but no sooner did I come to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) being unwell, than I
burst out, quite frightened, with <div class="bookquote">‘Bless me! poor Jane is ill!’ (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>—which
my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed
at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had
fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does
not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my
guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The
expense shall not be thought of; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) is so liberal, and so
fond of Jane that I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) would not mean to charge any thing for
attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has a wife
and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) time. Well,
now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will
turn to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter, and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own story a great deal
better than I can tell it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid we must be running away,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, glancing at Harriet,
and beginning to rise—"My father will be expecting us. I had no
intention, I thought I had no power of staying more than five minutes,
when I first entered the house. I merely called, because I would not
pass the door without inquiring after Mrs. Bates; but I have been so
pleasantly detained! Now, however, we must wish you and Mrs. Bates good
morning."

<p/>And not all that could be urged to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) succeeded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) regained
the street—happy in this, that though much had been forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>)
against her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had in fact heard the whole substance of
Jane Fairfax’s letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been able to escape the letter itself.
