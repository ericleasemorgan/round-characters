<p/>Half a minute conducted them through the pump-yard to the archway,
opposite Union Passage; but here they were stopped. Everybody
acquainted with Bath may remember the difficulties of crossing Cheap
Street at this point; it is indeed a street of so impertinent a nature,
so unfortunately connected with the great London and Oxford roads, and
the principal inn of the city, that a day never passes in which parties
of ladies, however important their business, whether in quest of
pastry, millinery, or even (as in the present case) of young men, are
not detained on one side or other by carriages, horsemen, or carts.
This evil had been felt and lamented, at least three times a day, by
Isabella since her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) residence in Bath; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was now fated to feel and
lament it once more, for at the very moment of coming opposite to Union
Passage, and within view of the two gentlemen who were proceeding
through the crowds, and threading the gutters of that interesting
alley, they were prevented crossing by the approach of a gig, driven
along on bad pavement by a most knowing-looking coachman with all the
vehemence that could most fitly endanger the lives of himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>)
companion, and his (<font color='blue'><b>coachman</b></font>) horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, these odious gigs!"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, looking up. <div class="bookquote">"How I detest
them."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But this detestation, though so just, was of short duration, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looked again and exclaimed, "Delightful! Mr. Morland and my
brother!"

<p/>"Good heaven! ’Tis James!" was uttered at the same moment by Catherine;
and, on catching the young men’s eyes, the horse was immediately
checked with a violence which almost threw him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) haunches, and the
servant having now scampered up, the gentlemen jumped out, and the
equipage was delivered to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) care.

<p/>Catherine, by whom this meeting was wholly unexpected, received her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
brother with the liveliest pleasure; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), being of a very amiable
disposition, and sincerely attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), gave every proof on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
side of equal satisfaction, which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could have leisure to do, while
the bright eyes of Miss Thorpe were incessantly challenging his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) notice;
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) devoirs were speedily paid, with a mixture of joy and
embarrassment which might have informed Catherine, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) been more
expert in the development of other people’s feelings, and less simply
engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend quite as
pretty as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could do herself.

<p/>John Thorpe, who in the meantime had been giving orders about the
horses, soon joined them, and from him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly received the amends
which were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) due; for while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) slightly and carelessly touched the
hand of Isabella, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) bestowed a whole scrape and half a short
bow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was a stout young man of middling height, who, with a plain
face and ungraceful form, seemed fearful of being too handsome unless
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) wore the dress of a groom, and too much like a gentleman unless he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
were easy where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) ought to be civil, and impudent where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be
allowed to be easy. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) watch: <div class="bookquote">"How long do you think we
have been running it from Tetbury, Miss Morland?"

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know the distance."  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) brother told her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) that it was
twenty-three miles.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_Three_-and-twenty!"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>cried Thorpe, <div class="bookquote">"five-and-twenty if it is an inch."
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>Morland remonstrated, pleaded the authority of road-books, innkeepers,
and milestones; but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friend disregarded them all; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had a surer
test of distance. <div class="bookquote">"I know it must be five-and-twenty,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), "by the
time we have been doing it. It is now half after one; we drove out of
the inn-yard at Tetbury as the town clock struck eleven; and I defy any
man in England to make my horse go less than ten miles an hour in
harness; that makes it exactly twenty-five."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have lost an hour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Morland/Miss Morland</b></font>)</div>said Morland; "it was only ten o’clock when we
came from Tetbury."

<p/>"Ten o’clock! It was eleven, upon my soul! I counted every stroke. This
brother of yours would persuade me out of my senses, Miss Morland; do
but look at my horse; did you ever see an animal so made for speed in
your life?<div class="bookquote">" (The servant had just mounted the carriage and was driving
off.) " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such true blood! Three hours and and a half indeed coming only
three and twenty miles! Look at that creature, and suppose it possible
if you can."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) _does_ look very hot, to be sure."

<p/>"Hot! He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had not turned a hair till we came to Walcot Church; but look
at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) forehand; look at his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) loins; only see how he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) moves; that horse
_cannot_ go less than ten miles an hour: tie his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) legs and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) will get
on. What do you think of my gig, Miss Morland? A neat one, is not it?
Well hung; town-built; I have not had it a month. It was built for a
Christchurch man, a friend of mine, a very good sort of fellow; he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ran
it a few weeks, till, I believe, it was convenient to have done with
it. I happened just then to be looking out for some light thing of the
kind, though I had pretty well determined on a curricle too; but I
chanced to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) on Magdalen Bridge, as he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was driving into Oxford,
last term: <div class="bookquote">‘Ah! Thorpe,’  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘do you happen to want such a little
thing as this? It is a capital one of the kind, but I am cursed tired
of it.’  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">‘Oh! D—,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I; <div class="bookquote">‘I am your man; what do you ask?’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And how
much do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, Miss Morland?"

<p/>"I am sure I cannot guess at all."

<p/>"Curricle-hung, you see; seat, trunk, sword-case, splashing-board,
lamps, silver moulding, all you see complete; the iron-work as good as
new, or better. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asked fifty guineas; I closed with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) directly,
threw down the money, and the carriage was mine."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, "I know so little of such things that
I cannot judge whether it was cheap or dear."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Neither one nor t’ (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>other; I might have got it for less, I dare say; but
I hate haggling, and poor Freeman wanted cash."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That was very good-natured of you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, quite pleased.

<p/>"Oh! D—— it, when one has the means of doing a kind thing by a friend,
I hate to be pitiful."

<p/>An inquiry now took place into the intended movements of the young
ladies; and, on finding whither they were going, it was decided that
the gentlemen should accompany them to Edgar’s Buildings, and pay their
respects to Mrs. Thorpe. James and Isabella led the way; and so well
satisfied was the latter with her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lot, so contentedly was she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
endeavouring to ensure a pleasant walk to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) who brought the double
recommendation of being her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother’s friend, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend’s brother,
so pure and uncoquettish were her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) feelings, that, though they overtook
and passed the two offending young men in Milsom Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was so far
from seeking to attract their notice, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looked back at them only
three times.

<p/>John Thorpe kept of course with Catherine, and, after a few minutes’
silence, renewed the conversation about his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) gig. <div class="bookquote">"You will find,
however, Miss Morland, it would be reckoned a cheap thing by some
people, for I might have sold it for ten guineas more the next day;
Jackson, of Oriel, bid me sixty at once; Morland was with me at the
time."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Morland/Miss Morland</b></font>)</div>said Morland, who overheard this; <div class="bookquote">"but you forget that your
horse was included."

 (<font color='red'><b>Morland/Miss Morland</b></font>)</div><p/>"My horse! Oh, d—— it! I would not sell my horse for a hundred. Are you
fond of an open carriage, Miss Morland?"

<p/>"Yes, very; I have hardly ever an opportunity of being in one; but I am
particularly fond of it."

<p/>"I am glad of it; I will drive you out in mine every day."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Thank you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, in some distress, from a doubt of the
propriety of accepting such an offer.

<p/>"I will drive you up Lansdown Hill tomorrow."

<p/>"Thank you; but will not your horse want rest?"

<p/>"Rest! He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has only come three and twenty miles today; all nonsense;
nothing ruins horses so much as rest; nothing knocks them up so soon.
No, no; I shall exercise mine at the average of four hours every day
while I am here."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Shall you indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine very seriously. "That will be forty
miles a day."

<p/>"Forty! Aye, fifty, for what I care. Well, I will drive you up Lansdown
tomorrow; mind, I am engaged."

<p/>"How delightful that will be!<div class="bookquote">" cried Isabella, turning round. " (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>My
dearest Catherine, I quite envy you; but I am afraid, brother, you will
not have room for a third."

<p/>"A third indeed! No, no; I did not come to Bath to drive my sisters
about; that would be a good joke, faith! Morland must take care of
you."

<p/>This brought on a dialogue of civilities between the other two; but
Catherine heard neither the particulars nor the result. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) companion’s
discourse now sunk from its hitherto animated pitch to nothing more
than a short decisive sentence of praise or condemnation on the face of
every woman they met; and Catherine, after listening and agreeing as
long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could, with all the civility and deference of the youthful
female mind, fearful of hazarding an opinion of its own in opposition
to that of a self-assured man, especially where the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
sex is concerned, ventured at length to vary the subject by a question
which had been long uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts; it was, <div class="bookquote">"Have you ever
read Udolpho, Mr. Thorpe?"

 (<font color='red'><b>man</b></font>)</div><p/>"Udolpho! Oh, Lord! Not I; I never read novels; I have something else
to do."

<p/>Catherine, humbled and ashamed, was going to apologize for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
question, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by saying, "Novels are all so full of
nonsense and stuff; there has not been a tolerably decent one come out
since Tom Jones, except The Monk; I read that t’other day; but as for
all the others, they are the stupidest things in creation."

<p/>"I think you must like Udolpho, if you were to read it; it is so very
interesting."

<p/>"Not I, faith! No, if I read any, it shall be Mrs. Radcliffe’s; her (<font color='blue'><b>Radcliffe</b></font>)
novels are amusing enough; they are worth reading; some fun and nature
in _them_."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Udolpho was written by Mrs. Radcliffe,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, with some
hesitation, from the fear of mortifying him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>).

<p/>"No sure; was it? Aye, I remember, so it was; I was thinking of that
other stupid book, written by that woman they make such a fuss about,
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) who married the French emigrant."

<p/>"I suppose you mean Camilla?"

<p/>"Yes, that’s the book; such unnatural stuff! An old man playing at
see-saw, I took up the first volume once and looked it over, but I soon
found it would not do; indeed I guessed what sort of stuff it must be
before I saw it: as soon as I heard she (<font color='blue'><b>Camilla</b></font>) had married an emigrant, I was
sure I should never be able to get through it."

<p/>"I have never read it."

<p/>"You had no loss, I assure you; it is the horridest nonsense you can
imagine; there is nothing in the world in it but an old man’s playing
at see-saw and learning Latin; upon my soul there is not.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This critique, the justness of which was unfortunately lost on poor
Catherine, brought them to the door of Mrs. Thorpe’s lodgings, and the
feelings of the discerning and unprejudiced reader of Camilla gave way
to the feelings of the dutiful and affectionate son, as they met Mrs.
Thorpe, who had descried them from above, in the passage. " (<font color='red'><b>Mother</b></font>)</div>Ah, Mother!
How do you do?" said he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mother</b></font>) a hearty shake of the hand. "Where
did you get that quiz of a hat? It makes you look like an old witch.
Here is Morland and I come to stay a few days with you, so you must
look out for a couple of good beds somewhere near." And this address
seemed to satisfy all the fondest wishes of the mother’s heart, for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
received him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) with the most delighted and exulting affection. On his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) two
younger sisters he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) then bestowed an equal portion of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) fraternal
tenderness, for he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) asked each of them how they did, and observed that
they both looked very ugly.

<p/>These manners did not please Catherine; but he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was James’s friend and
Isabella’s brother; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) judgment was further bought off by
Isabella’s assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), when they withdrew to see the new hat, that
John thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) the most charming girl in the world, and by John’s
engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) before they parted to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that evening. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
been older or vainer, such attacks might have done little; but, where
youth and diffidence are united, it requires uncommon steadiness of
reason to resist the attraction of being called the most charming girl
in the world, and of being so very early engaged as a partner; and the
consequence was that, when the two Morlands, after sitting an hour with
the Thorpes, set off to walk together to Mr. Allen’s, and James, as the
door was closed on them, said, <div class="bookquote">"Well, Catherine, how do you like my
friend Thorpe?"  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>instead of answering, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) probably would have done,
had there been no friendship and no flattery in the case, <div class="bookquote">"I do not
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) at all,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly replied, <div class="bookquote">"I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) very much; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seems
very agreeable."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) is as good-natured a fellow as ever lived; a little of a rattle;
but that will recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to your sex, I believe: and how do you like
the rest of the family?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Very, very much indeed: Isabella particularly."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I am very glad to hear you say so; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is just the kind of young woman
I could wish to see you attached to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has so much good sense, and is
so thoroughly unaffected and amiable; I always wanted you to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>);
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) seems very fond of you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) said the highest things in your
praise that could possibly be; and the praise of such a girl as Miss
Thorpe even you, Catherine,<div class="bookquote">" taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) hand with affection, " (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>may be
proud of."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed I am,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) replied; "I love her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) exceedingly, and am delighted
to find that you like her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) too. You hardly mentioned anything of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
when you wrote to me after your visit there."

<p/>"Because I thought I should soon see you myself. I hope you will be a
great deal together while you are in Bath. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) is a most amiable girl;
such a superior understanding! How fond all the family are of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
is evidently the general favourite; and how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) must be admired in
such a place as this—is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Yes, very much indeed, I fancy; Mr. Allen thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) the prettiest
girl in Bath."

<p/>"I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) does; and I do not know any man who is a better judge of
beauty than Mr. Allen. I need not ask you whether you are happy here,
my dear Catherine; with such a companion and friend as Isabella Thorpe,
it would be impossible for you to be otherwise; and the Allens, I am
sure, are very kind to you?"

<p/>"Yes, very kind; I never was so happy before; and now you are come it
will be more delightful than ever; how good it is of you to come so far
on purpose to see _me_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>James accepted this tribute of gratitude, and qualified his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) conscience
for accepting it too, by saying with perfect sincerity, " (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>Indeed,
Catherine, I love you dearly."

<p/>Inquiries and communications concerning brothers and sisters, the
situation of some, the growth of the rest, and other family matters now
passed between them, and continued, with only one small digression on
James’s part, in praise of Miss Thorpe, till they reached Pulteney
Street, where he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) was welcomed with great kindness by Mr. and Mrs.
Allen, invited by the former to dine with them, and summoned by the
latter to guess the price and weigh the merits of a new muff and
tippet. A pre-engagement in Edgar’s Buildings prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) accepting
the invitation of one friend, and obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) to hurry away as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edgar</b></font>) had satisfied the demands of the other. The time of the two parties
uniting in the Octagon Room being correctly adjusted, Catherine was
then left to the luxury of a raised, restless, and frightened
imagination over the pages of Udolpho, lost from all worldly concerns
of dressing and dinner, incapable of soothing Mrs. Allen’s fears on the
delay of an expected dressmaker, and having only one minute in sixty to
bestow even on the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own felicity, in being already
engaged for the evening.
