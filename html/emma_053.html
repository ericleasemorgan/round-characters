<p/>Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) safety; and if the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be the mother of a little girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) grew older—and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence—to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston—no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) has had the advantage, you know, of practising on me,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) continued—<div class="bookquote">"like La Baronne d'Almane on La Comtesse d'Ostalis, in Madame de Genlis' Adelaide and Theodore, and we shall now see her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own little Adelaide educated on a more perfect plan."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"That is,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mr. Knightley, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) will indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) even more than she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) did you, and believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) does not indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) at all. It will be the only difference."

<p/>"Poor child!" cried Emma; "at that rate, what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Nothing very bad.—The fate of thousands. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will be disagreeable in infancy, and correct herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grows older. I am losing all my bitterness against spoilt children, my dearest Emma. I, who am owing all my happiness to you, would not it be horrible ingratitude in me to be severe on them?"

<p/>Emma laughed, and replied: "But I had the assistance of all your endeavours to counteract the indulgence of other people. I doubt whether my own sense would have corrected me without it."

<p/>"Do you?—I have no doubt. Nature gave you understanding:—Miss Taylor gave you principles. You must have done well. My interference was quite as likely to do harm as good. It was very natural for you to say, what right has he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) to lecture me?—and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."

<p/>"I am sure you were of use to me,<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I was very often influenced rightly by you—oftener than I would own at the time. I am very sure you did me good. And if poor little Anna Weston is to be spoiled, it will be the greatest humanity in you to do as much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) as you have done for me, except falling in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anna</b></font>) is thirteen."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How often, when you were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks—' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'—something which, you knew, I did not approve. In such cases my interference was giving you two bad feelings instead of one."

<p/>"What an amiable creature I was!—No wonder you should hold my speeches in such affectionate remembrance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley.'—You always called me, 'Mr. Knightley;' and, from habit, it has not so very formal a sound.—And yet it is formal. I want you to call me something else, but I do not know what."

<p/>"I remember once calling you <div class="bookquote">'George,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in one of my amiable fits, about ten years ago. I did it because I thought it would offend you; but, as you made no objection, I never did it again."

<p/>"And cannot you call me <div class="bookquote">'George'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>now?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Impossible!—I never can call you any thing but ' (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley.' I will not promise even to equal the elegant terseness of Mrs. Elton, by calling you Mr. K.—But I will promise," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) added presently, laughing and blushing—"I will promise to call you once by your Christian name. I do not say when, but perhaps you may guess where;—in the building in which N. takes M. for better, for worse."

<p/>Emma grieved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be more openly just to one important service which his (<font color='blue'><b>K.</b></font>) better sense would have rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to the advice which would have saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the worst of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) womanly follies—her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not enter on it.—Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. This, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) side, might merely proceed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.

<p/>Isabella sent quite as good an account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) visitor as could be expected; on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) first arrival she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) out of spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) did not appear to find Harriet different from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had known her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before.—Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was invited to remain till they could bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"John does not even mention your friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley. <div class="bookquote">"Here is his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answer, if you like to see it."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>It was the answer to the communication of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) intended marriage. Emma accepted it with a very eager hand, with an impatience all alive to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would say about it, and not at all checked by hearing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend was unmentioned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"John enters like a brother into my happiness,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>continued Mr. Knightley, "but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is no complimenter; and though I well know him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to have, likewise, a most brotherly affection for you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is so far from making flourishes, that any other young woman might think him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) rather cool in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) praise. But I am not afraid of your seeing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) writes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) writes like a sensible man,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had read the letter. "I honour his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sincerity. It is very plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) considers the good fortune of the engagement as all on my side, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not without hope of my growing, in time, as worthy of your affection, as you think me already. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said any thing to bear a different construction, I should not have believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)."

<p/>"My Emma, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) means no such thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) only means—"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) and I should differ very little in our estimation of the two,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>interrupted she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), with a sort of serious smile—"much less, perhaps, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is aware of, if we could enter without ceremony or reserve on the subject."

<p/>"Emma, my dear Emma—"

<p/>"Oh!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried with more thorough gaiety, " (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>if you fancy your brother does not do me justice, only wait till my dear father is in the secret, and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion. Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be much farther from doing you justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will think all the happiness, all the advantage, on your side of the question; all the merit on mine. I wish I may not sink into <div class="bookquote">'poor Emma'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at once.—His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tender compassion towards oppressed worth can go no farther."

<p/>"Ah!" he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried, "I wish your father might be half as easily convinced as John will be, of our having every right that equal worth can give, to be happy together. I am amused by one part of John's letter—did you notice it?—where he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) says, that my information did not take him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) wholly by surprize, that he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was rather in expectation of hearing something of the kind."

<p/>"If I understand your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) only means so far as your having some thoughts of marrying. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had no idea of me. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) seems perfectly unprepared for that."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, yes—but I am amused that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should have seen so far into my feelings. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) been judging by?—I am not conscious of any difference in my spirits or conversation that could prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) at this time for my marrying any more than at another.—But it was so, I suppose. I dare say there was a difference when I was staying with them the other day. I believe I did not play with the children quite so much as usual. I remember one evening the poor boys saying, ' (<font color='red'><b>Uncle</b></font>)</div>Uncle seems always tired now.'"

<p/>The time was coming when the news must spread farther, and other persons' reception of it tried. As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.—But how to break it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father at last!—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart would have failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to make.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), by a melancholy tone herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not appear to think it a misfortune.—With all the spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could command, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prepared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) consent and approbation could be obtained—which, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all—she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) loved, next to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.

<p/>Poor man!—it was at first a considerable shock to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) tried earnestly to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) from it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was reminded, more than once, of having always said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.—But it would not do. Emma hung about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must not class her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not going from Hartfield; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) should be always there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was very sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were once got used to the idea.—Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not love Mr. Knightley very much?—He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not deny that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was sure.—Whom did he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?—Who was so useful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), who so ready to write his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) letters, who so glad to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?—Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?—Would not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) like to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always on the spot?—Yes. That was all very true. Mr. Knightley could not be there too often; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day;—but they did see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) every day as it was.—Why could not they go on as they had done?

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.—To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.—They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light—first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one—well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.—It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was used to be guided assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that it would be for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began to think that some time or other—in another year or two, perhaps—it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.

<p/>Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) in favour of the event.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to the utmost.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) deserved even her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.—How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!—The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband's plans and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment—less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself—but even he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying—<div class="bookquote">"Those matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.

<p/>Mrs. Weston, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) baby on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knee, indulging in such reflections as these, was one of the happiest women in the world. If any thing could increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) delight, it was perceiving that the baby would soon have outgrown its first set of caps.

<p/>The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) quickness of mind.—He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was not far from believing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had always foreseen it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is to be a secret, I conclude,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). "These matters are always a secret, till it is found out that every body knows them. Only let me be told when I may speak out.—I wonder whether Jane has any suspicion."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the news. Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) like a daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eldest daughter?—he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must tell her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.

<p/>In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and others might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), the most in luck. One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.—There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only hoped <div class="bookquote">"the young lady's pride would now be contented;"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and supposed "she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had always meant to catch Knightley if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could;" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, <div class="bookquote">"Rather he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) than I!" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.—"Poor Knightley! poor fellow!—sad business for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)."—She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had a thousand good qualities.—How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) be so taken in?—Did not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at all in love—not in the least.—Poor Knightley!—There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).—How happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! But that would be all over now.—Poor fellow!—No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.—Extremely disagreeable! But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was not at all sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had abused the housekeeper the other day.—Shocking plan, living together. It would never do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter.
