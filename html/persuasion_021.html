<p/>Anne recollected with pleasure the next morning her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) promise of going to
Mrs Smith, meaning that it should engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) from home at the time when
Mr Elliot would be most likely to call; for to avoid Mr Elliot was
almost a first object.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt a great deal of good-will towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  In spite of the
mischief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attentions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gratitude and regard, perhaps
compassion.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not help thinking much of the extraordinary
circumstances attending their acquaintance, of the right which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
seemed to have to interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), by everything in situation, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own
sentiments, by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) early prepossession.  It was altogether very
extraordinary; flattering, but painful.  There was much to regret.  How
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might have felt had there been no Captain Wentworth in the case,
was not worth enquiry; for there was a Captain Wentworth; and be the
conclusion of the present suspense good or bad, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) affection would be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) for ever.  Their union, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed, could not divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more
from other men, than their final separation.

<p/>Prettier musings of high-wrought love and eternal constancy, could
never have passed along the streets of Bath, than Anne was sporting
with from Camden Place to Westgate Buildings.  It was almost enough to
spread purification and perfume all the way.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was sure of a pleasant reception; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend seemed this
morning particularly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for coming, seemed hardly to have
expected her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), though it had been an appointment.

<p/>An account of the concert was immediately claimed; and Anne's
recollections of the concert were quite happy enough to animate her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
features and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoice to talk of it.  All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could tell
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told most gladly, but the all was little for one who had been
there, and unsatisfactory for such an enquirer as Mrs Smith, who had
already heard, through the short cut of a laundress and a waiter,
rather more of the general success and produce of the evening than Anne
could relate, and who now asked in vain for several particulars of the
company.  Everybody of any consequence or notoriety in Bath was well
know by name to Mrs Smith.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The little Durands were there, I conclude,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), "with their
mouths open to catch the music, like unfledged sparrows ready to be
fed.  They never miss a concert."

<p/>"Yes; I did not see them myself, but I heard Mr Elliot say they were in
the room."

<p/>"The Ibbotsons, were they there? and the two new beauties, with the
tall Irish officer, who is talked of for one of them."

<p/>"I do not know.  I do not think they were."

<p/>"Old Lady Mary Maclean?  I need not ask after her (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>) never misses, I
know; and you must have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Maclean</b></font>) must have been in your own
circle; for as you went with Lady Dalrymple, you were in the seats of
grandeur, round the orchestra, of course."

<p/>"No, that was what I dreaded.  It would have been very unpleasant to me
in every respect.  But happily Lady Dalrymple always chooses to be
farther off; and we were exceedingly well placed, that is, for hearing;
I must not say for seeing, because I appear to have seen very little."

<p/>"Oh! you saw enough for your own amusement.  I can understand.  There
is a sort of domestic enjoyment to be known even in a crowd, and this
you had.  You were a large party in yourselves, and you wanted nothing
beyond."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But I ought to have looked about me more,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, conscious while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that
the object only had been deficient.

<p/>"No, no; you were better employed.  You need not tell me that you had a
pleasant evening.  I see it in your eye.  I perfectly see how the hours
passed:  that you had always something agreeable to listen to.  In the
intervals of the concert it was conversation."

<p/>Anne half smiled and said, "Do you see that in my eye?"

<p/>"Yes, I do.  Your countenance perfectly informs me that you were in
company last night with the person whom you think the most agreeable in
the world, the person who interests you at this present time more than
all the rest of the world put together."

<p/>A blush overspread Anne's cheeks.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could say nothing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And such being the case,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs Smith, after a short pause, "I
hope you believe that I do know how to value your kindness in coming to
me this morning.  It is really very good of you to come and sit with
me, when you must have so many pleasanter demands upon your time."

<p/>Anne heard nothing of this.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was still in the astonishment and
confusion excited by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's penetration, unable to imagine how
any report of Captain Wentworth could have reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  After another
short silence--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pray,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, "is Mr Elliot aware of your acquaintance with
me?  Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) know that I am in Bath?"

<p/>"Mr Elliot!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Anne, looking up surprised.  A moment's
reflection shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the mistake she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been under.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) caught it
instantaneously; and recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) courage with the feeling of safety,
soon added, more composedly, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot/Elliot</b></font>)</div>Are you acquainted with Mr Elliot?"

<p/>"I have been a good deal acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs Smith,
gravely, " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>but it seems worn out now.  It is a great while since we met."

<p/>"I was not at all aware of this.  You never mentioned it before.  Had I
known it, I would have had the pleasure of talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) about you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To confess the truth,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Smith, assuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) usual air of
cheerfulness, "that is exactly the pleasure I want you to have.  I want
you to talk about me to Mr Elliot.  I want your interest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
can be of essential service to me; and if you would have the goodness,
my dear Miss Elliot, to make it an object to yourself, of course it is
done."

<p/>"I should be extremely happy; I hope you cannot doubt my willingness to
be of even the slightest use to you," replied Anne; "but I suspect that
you are considering me as having a higher claim on Mr Elliot, a greater
right to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), than is really the case.  I am sure you have,
somehow or other, imbibed such a notion.  You must consider me only as
Mr Elliot's relation.  If in that light there is anything which you
suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin might fairly ask of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), I beg you would not
hesitate to employ me."

<p/>Mrs Smith gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a penetrating glance, and then, smiling, said--

<p/>"I have been a little premature, I perceive; I beg your pardon.  I
ought to have waited for official information.  But now, my dear Miss
Elliot, as an old friend, do give me a hint as to when I may speak.
Next week?  To be sure by next week I may be allowed to think it all
settled, and build my own selfish schemes on Mr Elliot's good fortune."

<p/>"No," replied Anne, "nor next week, nor next, nor next.  I assure you
that nothing of the sort you are thinking of will be settled any week.
I am not going to marry Mr Elliot.  I should like to know why you
imagine I am?"

<p/>Mrs Smith looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) again, looked earnestly, smiled, shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
head, and exclaimed--

<p/>"Now, how I do wish I understood you!  How I do wish I knew what you
were at!  I have a great idea that you do not design to be cruel, when
the right moment occurs.  Till it does come, you know, we women never
mean to have anybody.  It is a thing of course among us, that every man
is refused, till he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) offers.  But why should you be cruel?  Let me plead
for my--present friend I cannot call him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), but for my former friend.
Where can you look for a more suitable match?  Where could you expect a
more gentlemanlike, agreeable man?  Let me recommend Mr Elliot.  I am
sure you hear nothing but good of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) from Colonel Wallis; and who can
know him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) better than Colonel Wallis?"

<p/>"My dear Mrs Smith, Mr Elliot's wife has not been dead much above half
a year.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) ought not to be supposed to be paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) addresses to any
one."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! if these are your only objections,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith, archly, "Mr
Elliot is safe, and I shall give myself no more trouble about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  Do
not forget me when you are married, that's all.  Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) know me to be
a friend of yours, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will think little of the trouble
required, which it is very natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) now, with so many affairs
and engagements of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own, to avoid and get rid of as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can; very
natural, perhaps.  Ninety-nine out of a hundred would do the same.  Of
course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cannot be aware of the importance to me.  Well, my dear Miss
Elliot, I hope and trust you will be very happy.  Mr Elliot has sense
to understand the value of such a woman.  Your peace will not be
shipwrecked as mine has been.  You are safe in all worldly matters, and
safe in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) character.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will not be led astray; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will not be
misled by others to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) ruin."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "I can readily believe all that of my cousin.  He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
seems to have a calm decided temper, not at all open to dangerous
impressions.  I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) with great respect.  I have no reason,
from any thing that has fallen within my observation, to do otherwise.
But I have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) long; and he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) is not a man, I think, to be
known intimately soon.  Will not this manner of speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), Mrs
Smith, convince you that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing to me?  Surely this must be calm
enough.  And, upon my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is nothing to me.  Should he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ever
propose to me (which I have very little reason to imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has any
thought of doing), I shall not accept him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  I assure you I shall not.
I assure you, Mr Elliot had not the share which you have been
supposing, in whatever pleasure the concert of last night might afford:
not Mr Elliot; it is not Mr Elliot that--"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) stopped, regretting with a deep blush that she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had implied so much;
but less would hardly have been sufficient.  Mrs Smith would hardly
have believed so soon in Mr Elliot's failure, but from the perception
of there being a somebody else.  As it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) instantly submitted,
and with all the semblance of seeing nothing beyond; and Anne, eager to
escape farther notice, was impatient to know why Mrs Smith should have
fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was to marry Mr Elliot; where she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could have received the
idea, or from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could have heard it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do tell me how it first came into your head."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"It first came into my head,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith, "upon finding how much
you were together, and feeling it to be the most probable thing in the
world to be wished for by everybody belonging to either of you; and you
may depend upon it that all your acquaintance have disposed of you in
the same way.  But I never heard it spoken of till two days ago."

<p/>"And has it indeed been spoken of?"

<p/>"Did you observe the woman who opened the door to you when you called
yesterday?"

<p/>"No.  Was not it Mrs Speed, as usual, or the maid?  I observed no one
in particular."

<p/>"It was my friend Mrs Rooke; Nurse Rooke; who, by-the-bye, had a great
curiosity to see you, and was delighted to be in the way to let you in.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) came away from Marlborough Buildings only on Sunday; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) it was
who told me you were to marry Mr Elliot.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>) had had it from Mrs
Wallis herself, which did not seem bad authority.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mrs</b></font>) sat an hour with
me on Monday evening, and gave me the whole history." <div class="bookquote">"The whole
history,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>repeated Anne, laughing.  "She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not make a very long
history, I think, of one such little article of unfounded news.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs Smith said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But,<div class="bookquote">" continued Anne, presently, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot/Elliot</b></font>)</div>though there is no truth in my
having this claim on Mr Elliot, I should be extremely happy to be of
use to you in any way that I could.  Shall I mention to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) your being
in Bath?  Shall I take any message?"

<p/>"No, I thank you:  no, certainly not.  In the warmth of the moment, and
under a mistaken impression, I might, perhaps, have endeavoured to
interest you in some circumstances; but not now.  No, I thank you, I
have nothing to trouble you with."

<p/>"I think you spoke of having known Mr Elliot many years?"

<p/>"I did."

<p/>"Not before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was married, I suppose?"

<p/>"Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not married when I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first."

<p/>"And--were you much acquainted?"

<p/>"Intimately."

<p/>"Indeed!  Then do tell me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was at that time of life.  I have a
great curiosity to know what Mr Elliot was as a very young man.  Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
at all such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) appears now?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have not seen Mr Elliot these three years,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>was Mrs Smith's answer,
given so gravely that it was impossible to pursue the subject farther;
and Anne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had gained nothing but an increase of curiosity.
They were both silent:  Mrs Smith very thoughtful.  At last--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I beg your pardon, my dear Miss Elliot,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cried, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) natural
tone of cordiality, "I beg your pardon for the short answers I have
been giving you, but I have been uncertain what I ought to do.  I have
been doubting and considering as to what I ought to tell you.  There
were many things to be taken into the account.  One hates to be
officious, to be giving bad impressions, making mischief.  Even the
smooth surface of family-union seems worth preserving, though there may
be nothing durable beneath.  However, I have determined; I think I am
right; I think you ought to be made acquainted with Mr Elliot's real
character.  Though I fully believe that, at present, you have not the
smallest intention of accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), there is no saying what may
happen.  You might, some time or other, be differently affected towards
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  Hear the truth, therefore, now, while you are unprejudiced.  Mr
Elliot is a man without heart or conscience; a designing, wary,
cold-blooded being, who thinks only of himself; whom for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own
interest or ease, would be guilty of any cruelty, or any treachery,
that could be perpetrated without risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) general character.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
has no feeling for others.  Those whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has been the chief cause of
leading into ruin, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can neglect and desert without the smallest
compunction.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is totally beyond the reach of any sentiment of
justice or compassion.  Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is black at heart, hollow and black!"

<p/>Anne's astonished air, and exclamation of wonder, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pause, and
in a calmer manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added,

<p/>"My expressions startle you.  You must allow for an injured, angry
woman.  But I will try to command myself.  I will not abuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  I
will only tell you what I have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  Facts shall speak.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
the intimate friend of my dear husband, who trusted and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as good as himself.  The intimacy had been formed before
our marriage.  I found them most intimate friends; and I, too, became
excessively pleased with Mr Elliot, and entertained the highest opinion
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  At nineteen, you know, one does not think very seriously; but
Mr Elliot appeared to me quite as good as others, and much more
agreeable than most others, and we were almost always together.  We
were principally in town, living in very good style.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was then the
inferior in circumstances; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was then the poor one; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had chambers in
the Temple, and it was as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could do to support the appearance
of a gentleman.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had always a home with us whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) chose it; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
was always welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was like a brother.  My poor Charles, who had
the finest, most generous spirit in the world, would have divided his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
last farthing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); and I know that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) purse was open to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); I
know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) often assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said
Anne, "which has always excited my particular curiosity.  It must have
been about the same time that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) became known to my father and sister.
I never knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) myself; I only heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); but there was a something
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct then, with regard to my father and sister, and
afterwards in the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) marriage, which I never could
quite reconcile with present times.  It seemed to announce a different
sort of man."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know it all, I know it all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith.  "He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been
introduced to Sir Walter and your sister before I was acquainted with
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) speak of them for ever.  I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was invited and
encouraged, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not choose to go.  I can satisfy you,
perhaps, on points which you would little expect; and as to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
marriage, I knew all about it at the time.  I was privy to all the fors
and againsts; I was the friend to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) confided his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) hopes and plans;
and though I did not know his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife previously, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) inferior situation
in society, indeed, rendered that impossible, yet I knew her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
life afterwards, or at least till within the last two years of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
life, and can answer any question you may wish to put."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nay,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "I have no particular enquiry to make about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  I
have always understood they were not a happy couple.  But I should like
to know why, at that time of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) life, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should slight my father's
acquaintance as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did.  My father was certainly disposed to take very
kind and proper notice of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).  Why did Mr Elliot draw back?"

<p/>"Mr Elliot,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs Smith, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot/Elliot</b></font>)</div>at that period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) life, had one
object in view:  to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) fortune, and by a rather quicker process
than the law.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was determined to make it by marriage.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
determined, at least, not to mar it by an imprudent marriage; and I
know it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) belief (whether justly or not, of course I cannot
decide), that your father and sister, in their civilities and
invitations, were designing a match between the heir and the young
lady, and it was impossible that such a match should have answered his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
ideas of wealth and independence.  That was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) motive for drawing
back, I can assure you.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me the whole story.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no
concealments with me.  It was curious, that having just left you behind
me in Bath, my first and principal acquaintance on marrying should be
your cousin; and that, through him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), I should be continually hearing of
your father and sister.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) described one Miss Elliot, and I thought
very affectionately of the other."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, "you sometimes spoke of
me to Mr Elliot?"

<p/>"To be sure I did; very often.  I used to boast of my own Anne Elliot,
and vouch for your being a very different creature from--<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) checked herself just in time.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a creature</b></font>)</div>This accounts for something which Mr Elliot said last night," cried
Anne.  "This explains it.  I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been used to hear of me.  I
could not comprehend how.  What wild imaginations one forms where dear
self is concerned!  How sure to be mistaken!  But I beg your pardon; I
have interrupted you.  Mr Elliot married then completely for money?
The circumstances, probably, which first opened your eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
character.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs Smith hesitated a little here.  " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! those things are too common.
When one lives in the world, a man or woman's marrying for money is too
common to strike one as it ought.  I was very young, and associated
only with the young, and we were a thoughtless, gay set, without any
strict rules of conduct.  We lived for enjoyment.  I think differently
now; time and sickness and sorrow have given me other notions; but at
that period I must own I saw nothing reprehensible in what Mr Elliot
was doing.  <div class="bookquote">'To do the best for himself,'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>passed as a duty."

<p/>"But was not she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) a very low woman?"

<p/>"Yes; which I objected to, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would not regard.  Money, money, was
all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father was a grazier, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) grandfather had been
a butcher, but that was all nothing.  She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a fine woman, had had a
decent education, was brought forward by some cousins, thrown by chance
into Mr Elliot's company, and fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and not a
difficulty or a scruple was there on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side, with respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
birth.  All his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) caution was spent in being secured of the real amount
of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fortune, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) committed himself.  Depend upon it, whatever
esteem Mr Elliot may have for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own situation in life now, as a young
man he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had not the smallest value for it.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) chance for the Kellynch
estate was something, but all the honour of the family he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) held as cheap
as dirt.  I have often heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) declare, that if baronetcies were
saleable, anybody should have his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) for fifty pounds, arms and motto,
name and livery included; but I will not pretend to repeat half that I
used to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) say on that subject.  It would not be fair; and yet
you ought to have proof, for what is all this but assertion, and you
shall have proof."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>cried Anne.  "You have
asserted nothing contradictory to what Mr Elliot appeared to be some
years ago.  This is all in confirmation, rather, of what we used to
hear and believe.  I am more curious to know why he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) should be so
different now."

<p/>"But for my satisfaction, if you will have the goodness to ring for
Mary; stay:  I am sure you will have the still greater goodness of
going yourself into my bedroom, and bringing me the small inlaid box
which you will find on the upper shelf of the closet."

<p/>Anne, seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend to be earnestly bent on it, did as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was
desired.  The box was brought and placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and Mrs Smith,
sighing over it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) unlocked it, said--

<p/>"This is full of papers belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), to my husband; a small
portion only of what I had to look over when I lost him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).  The letter I
am looking for was one written by Mr Elliot to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) before our marriage,
and happened to be saved; why, one can hardly imagine.  But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was
careless and immethodical, like other men, about those things; and when
I came to examine his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) papers, I found it with others still more
trivial, from different people scattered here and there, while many
letters and memorandums of real importance had been destroyed.  Here it
is; I would not burn it, because being even then very little satisfied
with Mr Elliot, I was determined to preserve every document of former
intimacy.  I have now another motive for being glad that I can produce
it."

<p/>This was the letter, directed to <div class="bookquote">"Charles Smith, Esq.. Tunbridge Wells,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Dear Smith</b></font>)</div>and dated from London, as far back as July, 1803:--

<p/>"Dear Smith,--I have received yours.  Your kindness almost overpowers
me.  I wish nature had made such hearts as yours more common, but I
have lived three-and-twenty years in the world, and have seen none like
it.  At present, believe me, I have no need of your services, being in
cash again.  Give me joy:  I have got rid of Sir Walter and Miss..  They
are gone back to Kellynch, and almost made me swear to visit them this
summer; but my first visit to Kellynch will be with a surveyor, to tell
me how to bring it with best advantage to the hammer.  The baronet,
nevertheless, is not unlikely to marry again; he (<font color='blue'><b>surveyor</b></font>) is quite fool enough.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>surveyor</b></font>) does, however, they will leave me in peace, which may be a decent
equivalent  for the reversion.  He (<font color='blue'><b>surveyor</b></font>) is worse than last year.

<p/>"I wish I had any name but Elliot.  I am sick of it.  The name of
Walter I can drop, thank God! and I desire you will never insult me
with my second W. again, meaning, for the rest of my life, to be only
yours truly,--Wm. Elliot."

<p/>Such a letter could not be read without putting Anne in a glow; and Mrs
Smith, observing the high colour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face, said--

<p/>"The language, I know, is highly disrespectful.  Though I have forgot
the exact terms, I have a perfect impression of the general meaning.
But it shows you the man.  Mark his (<font color='blue'><b>Mark</b></font>) professions to my poor husband.
Can any thing be stronger?"

<p/>Anne could not immediately get over the shock and mortification of
finding such words applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was obliged to recollect
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seeing the letter was a violation of the laws of honour, that
no one ought to be judged or to be known by such testimonies, that no
private correspondence could bear the eye of others, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could
recover calmness enough to return the letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been
meditating over, and say--

<p/>"Thank you.  This is full proof undoubtedly; proof of every thing you
were saying.  But why be acquainted with us now?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can explain this too,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Smith, smiling.

<p/>"Can you really?"

<p/>"Yes.  I have shewn you Mr Elliot as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was a dozen years ago, and I
will shew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is now.  I cannot produce written proof again, but
I can give as authentic oral testimony as you can desire, of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is
now wanting, and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is now doing.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is no hypocrite now.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
truly wants to marry you.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present attentions to your family are
very sincere:  quite from the heart.  I will give you my authority: his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
friend Colonel Wallis."

<p/>"Colonel Wallis! you are acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)?"

<p/>"No.  It does not come to me in quite so direct a line as that; it
takes a bend or two, but nothing of consequence.  The stream is as good
as at first; the little rubbish it collects in the turnings is easily
moved away.  Mr Elliot talks unreservedly to Colonel Wallis of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
views on you, which said Colonel Wallis, I imagine to be, in himself, a
sensible, careful, discerning sort of character; but Colonel Wallis has
a very pretty silly wife, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) tells things which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had better
not, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) repeats it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) in the overflowing spirits of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) recovery, repeats it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) nurse; and the nurse  knowing my
acquaintance with you, very naturally brings it all to me.  On Monday
evening, my good friend Mrs Rooke let me thus much into the secrets of
Marlborough Buildings.  When I talked of a whole history, therefore,
you see I was not romancing so much as you supposed."

<p/>"My dear Mrs Smith, your authority is deficient.  This will not do.  Mr
Elliot's having any views on me will not in the least account for the
efforts he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) made towards a reconciliation with my father.  That was all
prior to my coming to Bath.  I found them on the most friendly terms
when I arrived."

<p/>"I know you did; I know it all perfectly, but--"

<p/>"Indeed, Mrs Smith, we must not expect to get real information in such
a line.  Facts or opinions which are to pass through the hands of so
many, to be misconceived by folly in one, and ignorance in another, can
hardly have much truth left."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Only give me a hearing.  You will soon be able to judge of the general
credit due, by listening to some particulars which you can yourself
immediately contradict or confirm.  Nobody supposes that you were his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
first inducement.  He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had seen you indeed, before he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came to Bath, and
admired you, but without knowing it to be you.  So says my historian,
at least.  Is this true?  Did he (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) see you last summer or autumn,
' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>somewhere down in the west,' to use her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) own words, without knowing it
to be you?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>historian</b></font>) certainly did.  So far it is very true.  At Lyme.  I happened to be
at Lyme."

<p/>"Well,<div class="bookquote">" continued Mrs Smith, triumphantly, " (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>grant my friend the credit
due to the establishment of the first point asserted.  He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw you then
at Lyme, and liked you so well as to be exceedingly pleased to meet
with you again in Camden Place, as Miss Anne Elliot, and from that
moment, I have no doubt, had a double motive in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) visits there.  But
there was another, and an earlier, which I will now explain.  If there
is anything in my story which you know to be either false or
improbable, stop me.  My account states, that your sister's friend, the
lady now staying with you, whom I have heard you mention, came to Bath
with Miss Elliot and Sir Walter as long ago as September (in short when
they first came themselves), and has been staying there ever since;
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is a clever, insinuating, handsome woman, poor and plausible,
and altogether such in situation and manner, as to give a general idea,
among Sir Walter's acquaintance, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) meaning to be Lady Elliot, and
as general a surprise that Miss Elliot should be apparently, blind to
the danger."

<p/>Here Mrs Smith paused a moment; but Anne had not a word to say, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
continued--

<p/>"This was the light in which it appeared to those who knew the family,
long before you returned to it; and Colonel Wallis had his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) eye upon
your father enough to be sensible of it, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not then visit
in Camden Place; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) regard for Mr Elliot gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) an interest in
watching all that was going on there, and when Mr Elliot came to Bath
for a day or two, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) happened to do a little before Christmas,
Colonel Wallis made him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) acquainted with the appearance of things, and
the reports beginning to prevail.  Now you are to understand, that time
had worked a very material change in Mr Elliot's opinions as to the
value of a baronetcy.  Upon all points of blood and connexion he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is a
completely altered man.  Having long had as much money as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could
spend, nothing to wish for on the side of avarice or indulgence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has
been gradually learning to pin his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) happiness upon the consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is
heir to.  I thought it coming on before our acquaintance ceased, but it
is now a confirmed feeling.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) cannot bear the idea of not being Sir
William.  You may guess, therefore, that the news he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
friend could not be very agreeable, and you may guess what it produced;
the resolution of coming back to Bath as soon as possible, and of
fixing himself here for a time, with the view of renewing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) former
acquaintance, and recovering such a footing in the family as might give
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) the means of ascertaining the degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) danger, and of
circumventing the lady if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found it material.  This was agreed upon
between the two friends as the only thing to be done; and Colonel
Wallis was to assist in every way that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was to be
introduced, and Mrs Wallis was to be introduced, and everybody was to
be introduced.  Mr Elliot came back accordingly; and on application was
forgiven, as you know, and re-admitted into the family; and there it
was his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) constant object, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) only object (till your arrival added
another motive), to watch Sir Walter and Mrs Clay.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) omitted no
opportunity of being with them, threw himself in their way, called at
all hours; but I need not be particular on this subject.  You can
imagine what an artful man would do; and with this guide, perhaps, may
recollect what you have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) do."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "you tell me nothing which does not accord with what
I have known, or could imagine.  There is always something offensive in
the details of cunning.  The manoeuvres of selfishness and duplicity
must ever be revolting, but I have heard nothing which really surprises
me.  I know those who would be shocked by such a representation of Mr
Elliot, who would have difficulty in believing it; but I have never
been satisfied.  I have always wanted some other motive for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct
than appeared.  I should like to know his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present opinion, as to the
probability of the event he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has been in dread of; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) considers
the danger to be lessening or not."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lessening, I understand,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Smith.  "He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) thinks Mrs Clay
afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) sees through her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and not daring to
proceed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) might do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) absence.  But since he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must be absent
some time or other, I do not perceive how he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) can ever be secure while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) holds her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) present influence.  Mrs Wallis has an amusing idea, as
nurse tells me, that it is to be put into the marriage articles when
you and Mr Elliot marry, that your father is not to marry Mrs Clay.  A
scheme, worthy of Mrs Wallis's understanding, by all accounts; but my
sensible nurse Rooke sees the absurdity of it.  <div class="bookquote">'Why, to be sure,
ma'am,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Rooke</b></font>), 'it would not prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marrying anybody else.'
And, indeed, to own the truth, I do not think nurse, in her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) heart, is a
very strenuous opposer of Sir Walter's making a second match.  She (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) must
be allowed to be a favourer of matrimony, you know; and (since self
will intrude) who can say that she (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>) may not have some flying visions of
attending the next Lady Elliot, through Mrs Wallis's recommendation?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am very glad to know all this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, after a little
thoughtfulness.  "It will be more painful to me in some respects to be
in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), but I shall know better what to do.  My line of
conduct will be more direct.  Mr Elliot is evidently a disingenuous,
artificial, worldly man, who has never had any better principle to
guide him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) than selfishness."

<p/>But Mr Elliot was not done with.  Mrs Smith had been carried away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) first direction, and Anne had forgotten, in the interest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
family concerns, how much had been originally implied against him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention was now called to the explanation of those first hints,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) listened to a recital which, if it did not perfectly justify
the unqualified bitterness of Mrs Smith, proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to have been very
unfeeling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); very deficient both in justice
and compassion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) learned that (the intimacy between them continuing unimpaired by Mr
Elliot's marriage) they had been as before always together, and Mr
Elliot had led his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend into expenses much beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) fortune.  Mrs
Smith did not want to take blame to herself, and was most tender of
throwing any on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband; but Anne could collect that their income
had never been equal to their style of living, and that from the first
there had been a great deal of general and joint extravagance.  From
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife's account of him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could discern Mr Smith to have been a man
of warm feelings, easy temper, careless habits, and not strong
understanding, much more amiable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend, and very unlike him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>),
led by him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and probably despised by him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).  Mr Elliot, raised by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
marriage to great affluence, and disposed to every gratification of
pleasure and vanity which could be commanded without involving himself,
(for with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) self-indulgence he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had become a prudent man), and
beginning to be rich, just as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend ought to have found himself to
be poor, seemed to have had no concern at all for that friend's
probable finances, but, on the contrary, had been prompting and
encouraging expenses which could end only in ruin; and the Smiths
accordingly had been ruined.

<p/>The husband had died just in time to be spared the full knowledge of
it.  They had previously known embarrassments enough to try the
friendship of their friends, and to prove that Mr Elliot's had better
not be tried; but it was not till his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) death that the wretched state of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) affairs was fully known.  With a confidence in Mr Elliot's regard,
more creditable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) feelings than his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) judgement, Mr Smith had
appointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) the executor of his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) will; but Mr Elliot would not act,
and the difficulties and distress which this refusal had heaped on her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>),
in addition to the inevitable sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) situation, had been
such as could not be related without anguish of spirit, or listened to
without corresponding indignation.

<p/>Anne was shewn some letters of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) on the occasion, answers to urgent
applications from Mrs Smith, which all breathed the same stern
resolution of not engaging in a fruitless trouble, and, under a cold
civility, the same hard-hearted indifference to any of the evils it
might bring on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>).  It was a dreadful picture of ingratitude and
inhumanity; and Anne felt, at some moments, that no flagrant open crime
could have been worse.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a great deal to listen to; all the
particulars of past sad scenes, all the minutiae of distress upon
distress, which in former conversations had been merely hinted at, were
dwelt on now with a natural indulgence.  Anne could perfectly
comprehend the exquisite relief, and was only the more inclined to
wonder at the composure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend's usual state of mind.

<p/>There was one circumstance in the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grievances of
particular irritation.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had good reason to believe that some
property of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband in the West Indies, which had been for many
years under a sort of sequestration for the payment of its own
incumbrances, might be recoverable by proper measures; and this
property, though not large, would be enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) comparatively
rich.  But there was nobody to stir in it.  Mr Elliot would do nothing,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do nothing herself, equally disabled from personal
exertion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) state of bodily weakness, and from employing others by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) want of money.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no natural connexions to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) even
with their counsel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not afford to purchase the assistance
of the law.  This was a cruel aggravation of actually straitened means.
To feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought to be in better circumstances, that a little
trouble in the right place might do it, and to fear that delay might be
even weakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) claims, was hard to bear.

<p/>It was on this point that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hoped to engage Anne's good offices
with Mr Elliot.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had previously, in the anticipation of their
marriage, been very apprehensive of losing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend by it; but on
being assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could have made no attempt of that nature, since
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) did not even know her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to be in Bath, it immediately occurred, that
something might be done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) favour by the influence of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
loved, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been hastily preparing to interest Anne's feelings,
as far as the observances due to Mr Elliot's character would allow,
when Anne's refutation of the supposed engagement changed the face of
everything; and while it took from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the new-formed hope of
succeeding in the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first anxiety, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at least the
comfort of telling the whole story her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own way.

<p/>After listening to this full description of Mr Elliot, Anne could not
but express some surprise at Mrs Smith's having spoken of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) so
favourably in the beginning of their conversation.  <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seemed to
recommend and praise him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)!"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Smith</b></font>)</div>was Mrs Smith's reply, "there was nothing else to be done.
I considered your marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as certain, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might not yet have
made the offer, and I could no more speak the truth of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
had been your husband.  My heart bled for you, as I talked of
happiness; and yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is sensible, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is agreeable, and with such a
woman as you, it was not absolutely hopeless.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was very unkind to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first wife.  They were wretched together.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was too ignorant
and giddy for respect, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had never loved her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>).  I was willing to
hope that you must fare better."

<p/>Anne could just acknowledge within herself such a possibility of having
been induced to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shudder at the idea of the
misery which must have followed.  It was just possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might
have been persuaded by Lady Russell!  And under such a supposition,
which would have been most miserable, when time had disclosed all, too
late?

<p/>It was very desirable that Lady Russell should be no longer deceived;
and one of the concluding arrangements of this important conference,
which carried them through the greater part of the morning, was, that
Anne had full liberty to communicate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend everything relative
to Mrs Smith, in which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) conduct was involved.
