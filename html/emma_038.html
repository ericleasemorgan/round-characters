<p/>No misfortune occurred, again to prevent the ball. The day approached, the day arrived; and after a morning of some anxious watching, Frank Churchill, in all the certainty of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own self, reached Randalls before dinner, and every thing was safe.

<p/>No second meeting had there yet been between him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) and Emma. The room at the Crown was to witness it; but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) entreaties for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.

<p/>Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not say much, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) meant to have a delightful evening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. <div class="bookquote">"So unreasonably early!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was going to exclaim; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.

<p/>Emma perceived that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) a higher character. General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could fancy such a man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.

<p/>Emma found that it was not Mr. Weston's fault that the number of privy councillors was not yet larger. They had stopped at Mrs. Bates's door to offer the use of their carriage, but the aunt and niece were to be brought by the Eltons.

<p/>Frank was standing by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), but not steadily; there was a restlessness, which shewed a mind not at ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was looking about, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was going to the door, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was watching for the sound of other carriages, impatient to begin, or afraid of being always near her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>).

<p/>Mrs. Elton was spoken of. <div class="bookquote">"I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must be here soon,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). "I have a great curiosity to see Mrs. Elton, I have heard so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). It cannot be long, I think, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) comes."

<p/>A carriage was heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was on the move immediately; but coming back, said,

<p/>"I am forgetting that I am not acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). I have never seen either Mr. or Mrs. Elton. I have no business to put myself forward.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Elton appeared; and all the smiles and the proprieties passed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates</b></font>)</div>But Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax!" said Mr. Weston, looking about. "We thought you were to bring them."

<p/>The mistake had been slight. The carriage was sent for them now. Emma longed to know what Frank's first opinion of Mrs. Elton might be; how he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was affected by the studied elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dress, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smiles of graciousness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was immediately qualifying himself to form an opinion, by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very proper attention, after the introduction had passed.

<p/>In a few minutes the carriage returned. Somebody talked of rain. <div class="bookquote">"I will see that there are umbrellas, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father: <div class="bookquote">"Miss Bates must not be forgotten:"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>and away he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) went. Mr. Weston was following; but Mrs. Elton detained him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; and so briskly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) begin, that the young man himself, though by no means moving slowly, could hardly be out of hearing.

<p/>"A very fine young man indeed, Mr. Weston. You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a very handsome young man, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) manners are precisely what I like and approve so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies quite a horror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove. Neither Mr. Suckling nor me had ever any patience with them; and we used sometimes to say very cutting things! Selina, who is mild almost to a fault, bore with them much better."

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) son, Mr. Weston's attention was chained; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) got to Maple Grove, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could recollect that there were ladies just arriving to be attended to, and with happy smiles must hurry away.

<p/>Mrs. Elton turned to Mrs. Weston. "I have no doubt of its being our carriage with Miss Bates and Jane. Our coachman and horses are so extremely expeditious! I believe we drive faster than any body. What a pleasure it is to send one's carriage for a friend! I understand you were so kind as to offer, but another time it will be quite unnecessary. You may be very sure I shall always take care of them.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax, escorted by the two gentlemen, walked into the room; and Mrs. Elton seemed to think it as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) duty as Mrs. Weston's to receive them. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speech under many minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) being admitted into the circle at the fire. As the door opened she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was heard,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So very obliging of you! No rain at all. Nothing to signify. I do not care for myself. Quite thick shoes. And Jane declares Well! (as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed! This is admirable! Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it. So well lighted up! Jane, Jane, look! did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) own room again. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) as I came in; she (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) was standing in the entrance. <div class="bookquote">'Oh! Mrs. Stokes,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I but I had not time for more.<div class="bookquote">" She (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>) was now met by Mrs. Weston. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headache! seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage! excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage. Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been. But two such offers in one day! Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, 'Upon my word, ma'am .' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) take her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) shawl for the evenings are not warm her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) large new shawl  Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present. So kind of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet? It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid: but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely and there was a mat to step upon I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) extreme politeness. Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), Jane? Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill? Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do? Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land! Such a transformation! Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently) that would be rude but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look how do you like Jane's hair? You are a judge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) does her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hair! No hairdresser from London I think could. Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment. How do you do? How do you do? Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it? Where's dear Mr. Richard? Oh! there he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) is. Don't disturb him (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>). Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard? I saw you the other day as you rode through the town Mrs. Otway, I protest! and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline. Such a host of friends! and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur! How do you do? How do you all do? Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never better. Don't I hear another carriage? Who can this be? very likely the worthy Coles. Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire! I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me never take coffee. A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye, no hurry Oh! here it comes. Every thing so good!"

<p/>Frank Churchill returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) station by Emma; and as soon as Miss Bates was quiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) found herself necessarily overhearing the discourse of Mrs. Elton and Miss Fairfax, who were standing a little way behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was thoughtful. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were overhearing too, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself and it was, "How do you like my gown? How do you like my trimming? How has Wright done my hair?" with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour I would not wish to be inferior to others. And I see very few pearls in the room except mine. So Frank Churchill is a capital dancer, I understand. We shall see if our styles suit. A fine young man certainly is Frank Churchill. I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very well."

<p/>At this moment Frank began talking so vigorously, that Emma could not but imagine he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had overheard his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) own praises, and did not want to hear more; and the voices of the ladies were drowned for a while, till another suspension brought Mrs. Elton's tones again distinctly forward. Mr. Elton had just joined them, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife was exclaiming,

<p/>"Oh! you have found us out at last, have you, in our seclusion? I was this moment telling Jane, I thought you would begin to be impatient for tidings of us."

<p/>"Jane!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Frank Churchill, with a look of surprize and displeasure. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That is easy but Miss Fairfax does not disapprove it, I suppose."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How do you like Mrs. Elton?"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma in a whisper.

<p/>"Not at all."

<p/>"You are ungrateful."

<p/>"Ungrateful! What do you mean?" Then changing from a frown to a smile "No, do not tell me I do not want to know what you mean. Where is my father? When are we to begin dancing?"

<p/>Emma could hardly understand him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed in an odd humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) walked off to find his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father, but was quickly back again with both Mr. and Mrs. Weston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had met with them in a little perplexity, which must be laid before Emma. It had just occurred to Mrs. Weston that Mrs. Elton must be asked to begin the ball; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would expect it; which interfered with all their wishes of giving Emma that distinction. Emma heard the sad truth with fortitude.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And what are we to do for a proper partner for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston. <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will think Frank ought to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div><p/>Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father looked his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) most perfect approbation of and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) into it, which was done pretty soon. Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). It was almost enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son's superior. In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had so many hours of unusual festivity before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else. There he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was, among the standers-by, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought not to be; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought to be dancing, not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up, so young as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had placed himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must have danced, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but take the trouble. Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to smile; but in general he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking grave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed often observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must not flatter herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dancing, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) were criticising her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaviour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done, was indubitable.

<p/>The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of. The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner; the only young lady sitting down; and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder! But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) every moment to escape into the card-room.

<p/>Escape, however, was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) plan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as if to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) liberty, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) resolution of maintaining it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). Emma saw it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not yet dancing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was working her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head a little she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw it all. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would no longer allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) perceived that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, who was standing immediately above her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), was not only listening also, but even encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) by significant glances. The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seat to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and say, <div class="bookquote">"Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to which his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prompt reply was, <div class="bookquote">"Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."

 (<font color='red'><b>Me</b></font>)</div><p/>"Me! oh! no I would get you a better partner than myself. I am no dancer."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If Mrs. Gilbert wishes to dance,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), "I shall have great pleasure, I am sure for, though beginning to feel myself rather an old married man, and that my dancing days are over, it would give me very great pleasure at any time to stand up with an old friend like Mrs. Gilbert."

<p/>"Mrs. Gilbert does not mean to dance, but there is a young lady disengaged whom I should be very glad to see dancing Miss Smith." "Miss Smith! oh! I had not observed. You are extremely obliging and if I were not an old married man. But my dancing days are over, Mrs. Weston. You will excuse me. Any thing else I should be most happy to do, at your command but my dancing days are over.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Weston said no more; and Emma could imagine with what surprize and mortification she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seat. This was Mr. Elton! the amiable, obliging, gentle Mr. Elton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked round for a moment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had joined Mr. Knightley at a little distance, and was arranging himself for settled conversation, while smiles of high glee passed between him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not look again. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heart was in a glow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) feared her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) face might be as hot.

<p/>In another moment a happier sight caught her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); Mr. Knightley leading Harriet to the set! Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) been more surprized, seldom more delighted, than at that instant. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was all pleasure and gratitude, both for Harriet and herself, and longed to be thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and though too distant for speech, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) countenance said much, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye again.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dancing proved to be just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed it, extremely good; and Harriet would have seemed almost too lucky, if it had not been for the cruel state of things before, and for the very complete enjoyment and very high sense of the distinction which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy features announced. It was not thrown away on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) bounded higher than ever, flew farther down the middle, and was in a continual course of smiles.

<p/>Mr. Elton had retreated into the card-room, looking (Emma trusted) very foolish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was quite so hardened as his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife, though growing very like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, by observing audibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>Knightley has taken pity on poor little Miss Smith! Very good-natured, I declare."

<p/>Supper was announced. The move began; and Miss Bates might be heard from that moment, without interruption, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) being seated at table and taking up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) spoon.

<p/>"Jane, Jane, my dear Jane, where are you? Here is your tippet. Mrs. Weston begs you to put on your tippet. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is afraid there will be draughts in the passage, though every thing has been done One door nailed up Quantities of matting My dear Jane, indeed you must. Mr. Churchill, oh! you are too obliging! How well you put it on! so gratified! Excellent dancing indeed! Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me. I set off without saying a word, just as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon. Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) came away: amazing luck in some of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) throws: and she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. <div class="bookquote">'Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, 'I shall not forestall Jane; I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dancing with Mr. George Otway; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too obliging. Is there nobody you would not rather? I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other! Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looks! Beautiful lace! Now we all follow in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) train. Quite the queen of the evening! Well, here we are at the passage. Two steps, Jane, take care of the two steps. Oh! no, there is but one. Well, I was persuaded there were two. How very odd! I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style Candles everywhere. I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane, There was a little disappointment. The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus so she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned! Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing! Such elegance and profusion! I have seen nothing like it since Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side? Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill only it seems too good but just as you please. What you direct in this house cannot be wrong. Dear Jane, how shall we ever recollect half the dishes for grandmama? Soup too! Bless me! I should not be helped so soon, but it smells most excellent, and I cannot help beginning."

<p/>Emma had no opportunity of speaking to Mr. Knightley till after supper; but, when they were all in the ballroom again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) irresistibly to come to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and be thanked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reprobation of Mr. Elton's conduct; it had been unpardonable rudeness; and Mrs. Elton's looks also received the due share of censure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They aimed at wounding more than Harriet,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"Emma, why is it that they are your enemies?"

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looked with smiling penetration; and, on receiving no answer, added, "She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought not to be angry with you, I suspect, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) may be. To that surmise, you say nothing, of course; but confess, Emma, that you did want him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to marry Harriet."

<p/>"I did,<div class="bookquote">" replied Emma, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and they cannot forgive me."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) head; but there was a smile of indulgence with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only said,

<p/>"I shall not scold you. I leave you to your own reflections."

<p/>"Can you trust me with such flatterers? Does my vain spirit ever tell me I am wrong?"

<p/>"Not your vain spirit, but your serious spirit. If one leads you wrong, I am sure the other tells you of it."

<p/>"I do own myself to have been completely mistaken in Mr. Elton. There is a littleness about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) which you discovered, and which I did not: and I was fully convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) being in love with Harriet. It was through a series of strange blunders!"

<p/>"And, in return for your acknowledging so much, I will do you the justice to say, that you would have chosen for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) better than he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has chosen for himself. Harriet Smith has some first-rate qualities, which Mrs. Elton is totally without. An unpretending, single-minded, artless girl infinitely to be preferred by any man of sense and taste to such a woman as Mrs. Elton. I found Harriet more conversable than I expected."

<p/>Emma was extremely gratified. They were interrupted by the bustle of Mr. Weston calling on every body to begin dancing again.

<p/>"Come Miss Woodhouse, Miss Otway, Miss Fairfax, what are you all doing? Come Emma, set your companions the example. Every body is lazy! Every body is asleep!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am ready,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "whenever I am wanted."

<p/>"Whom are you going to dance with?" asked Mr. Knightley.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hesitated a moment, and then replied, <div class="bookquote">"With you, if you will ask me."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Will you?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hand.

<p/>"Indeed I will. You have shewn that you can dance, and you know we are not really so much brother and sister as to make it at all improper."

<p/>"Brother and sister! no, indeed."
