<p/>No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged
herself in the pleasure of announcing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) son-in-law and his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) wife
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer
than till every thing were ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) inhabiting it. They heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband civilly
hoped that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would not be settled far from Norland. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had great
satisfaction in replying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was going into Devonshire.—Edward
turned hastily towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), on hearing this, and, in a voice of
surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), repeated,
"Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to
what part of it?" She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) explained the situation. It was within four miles
northward of Exeter.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is but a cottage,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) continued, "but I hope to see many of my
friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends
find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will
find none in accommodating them."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood
to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) at Barton; and to Edward she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave one with still greater
affection. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) late conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law had
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was
unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in that
point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was
as far from being her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) object as ever; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to show Mrs. John
Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) brother, how totally she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
disregarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disapprobation of the match.

<p/>Mr. John Dashwood told his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother again and again how exceedingly sorry
he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to
prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) being of any service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in removing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) furniture. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very
exertion to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had limited the performance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable.—The furniture
was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen,
plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne’s. Mrs.
John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could not help
feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood’s income would be so trifling in
comparison with their own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) should have any handsome article of
furniture.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either
side in the agreement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) waited only for the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
effects at Norland, and to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) future household, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
set off for the west; and this, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was exceedingly rapid in the
performance of everything that interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), was soon done.—The
horses which were left her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband had been sold soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) carriage,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest
daughter. For the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) consulted only her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
own wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor
prevailed. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ wisdom too limited the number of their servants to
three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from
amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.

<p/>The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire,
to prepare the house for their mistress’s arrival; for as Lady
Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) preferred going
directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
relied so undoubtingly on Sir John’s description of the house, as to
feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) entered it as her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by
the evident satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) daughter-in-law in the prospect of her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed
under a cold invitation to her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) departure. Now was the time
when her (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) son-in-law’s promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father might with particular
propriety be fulfilled. Since he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had neglected to do it on first coming
to the estate, their quitting his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) house might be looked on as the most
suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly
to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the
general drift of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) discourse, that his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) assistance extended no farther
than their maintenance for six months at Norland. He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) so frequently
talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual
demands upon his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was
beyond calculation exposed to, that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seemed rather to stand in need
of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.

<p/>In a very few weeks from the day which brought Sir John Middleton’s
first letter to Norland, every thing was so far settled in their future
abode as to enable Mrs. Dashwood and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters to begin their
journey.

<p/>Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so
much beloved. <div class="bookquote">"Dear, dear Norland!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wandered
alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; "when
shall I cease to regret you!—when learn to feel a home elsewhere!—Oh!
happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this
spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more!—And you, ye
well-known trees!—but you will continue the same.—No leaf will decay
because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we
can observe you no longer!—No; you will continue the same; unconscious
of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any
change in those who walk under your shade!—But who will remain to enjoy
you?"
