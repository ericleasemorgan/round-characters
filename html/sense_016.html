<p/>Marianne would have thought herself very inexcusable had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) been able
to sleep at all the first night after parting from Willoughby. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would have been ashamed to look her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family in the face the next
morning, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not risen from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bed in more need of repose than
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lay down in it. But the feelings which made such composure a
disgrace, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in no danger of incurring it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was awake the
whole night, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wept the greatest part of it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) got up with a
headache, was unable to talk, and unwilling to take any nourishment;
giving pain every moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother and sisters, and forbidding all
attempt at consolation from either. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sensibility was potent enough!

<p/>When breakfast was over she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked out by herself, and wandered about
the village of Allenham, indulging the recollection of past enjoyment
and crying over the present reverse for the chief of the morning.

<p/>The evening passed off in the equal indulgence of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) played
over every favourite song that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been used to play to Willoughby,
every air in which their voices had been oftenest joined, and sat at
the instrument gazing on every line of music that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had written out
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart was so heavy that no farther sadness could be
gained; and this nourishment of grief was every day applied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spent
whole hours at the pianoforte alternately singing and crying; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice
often totally suspended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears. In books too, as well as in
music, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) courted the misery which a contrast between the past and
present was certain of giving. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) read nothing but what they had been
used to read together.

<p/>Such violence of affliction indeed could not be supported for ever; it
sunk within a few days into a calmer melancholy; but these employments,
to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daily recurred, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) solitary walks and silent meditations,
still produced occasional effusions of sorrow as lively as ever.

<p/>No letter from Willoughby came; and none seemed expected by Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was surprised, and Elinor again became uneasy. But Mrs.
Dashwood could find explanations whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wanted them, which at
least satisfied herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Remember, Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), "how very often Sir John fetches our
letters himself from the post, and carries them to it. We have already
agreed that secrecy may be necessary, and we must acknowledge that it
could not be maintained if their correspondence were to pass through
Sir John’s hands."

<p/>Elinor could not deny the truth of this, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tried to find in it a
motive sufficient for their silence. But there was one method so
direct, so simple, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion so eligible of knowing the real
state of the affair, and of instantly removing all mystery, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not help suggesting it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why do you not ask Marianne at once,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), "whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is or she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
is not engaged to Willoughby? From you, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, and so kind, so
indulgent a mother, the question could not give offence. It would be
the natural result of your affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) used to be all
unreserve, and to you more especially."

<p/>"I would not ask such a question for the world. Supposing it possible
that they are not engaged, what distress would not such an enquiry
inflict! At any rate it would be most ungenerous. I should never
deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) confidence again, after forcing from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a confession of
what is meant at present to be unacknowledged to any one. I know
Marianne’s heart: I know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dearly loves me, and that I shall not
be the last to whom the affair is made known, when circumstances make
the revealment of it eligible. I would not attempt to force the
confidence of any one; of a child much less; because a sense of duty
would prevent the denial which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wishes might direct."

<p/>Elinor thought this generosity overstrained, considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s
youth, and urged the matter farther, but in vain; common sense, common
care, common prudence, were all sunk in Mrs. Dashwood’s romantic
delicacy.

<p/>It was several days before Willoughby’s name was mentioned before
Marianne by any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) family; Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, indeed, were
not so nice; their witticisms added pain to many a painful hour;—but
one evening, Mrs. Dashwood, accidentally taking up a volume of
Shakespeare, exclaimed,

<p/>"We have never finished Hamlet, Marianne; our dear Willoughby went away
before we could get through it. We will put it by, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) comes
again...But it may be months, perhaps, before _that_ happens."

<p/>"Months!<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, with strong surprise. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No—nor many weeks."

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was sorry for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had said; but it gave Elinor
pleasure, as it produced a reply from Marianne so expressive of
confidence in Willoughby and knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) intentions.

<p/>One morning, about a week after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) leaving the country, Marianne was
prevailed on to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters in their usual walk, instead of
wandering away by herself. Hitherto she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had carefully avoided every
companion in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rambles. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters intended to walk on the downs,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly stole away towards the lanes; if they talked of the
valley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as speedy in climbing the hills, and could never be
found when the others set off. But at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was secured by the
exertions of Elinor, who greatly disapproved such continual seclusion.
They walked along the road through the valley, and chiefly in silence,
for Marianne’s _mind_ could not be controlled, and Elinor, satisfied
with gaining one point, would not then attempt more. Beyond the
entrance of the valley, where the country, though still rich, was less
wild and more open, a long stretch of the road which they had travelled
on first coming to Barton, lay before them; and on reaching that point,
they stopped to look around them, and examine a prospect which formed
the distance of their view from the cottage, from a spot which they had
never happened to reach in any of their walks before.

<p/>Amongst the objects in the scene, they soon discovered an animated one;
it was a man on horseback riding towards them. In a few minutes they
could distinguish him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be a gentleman; and in a moment afterwards
Marianne rapturously exclaimed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); it is indeed;—I know it is!" (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>—and was hastening to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>),
when Elinor cried out,

<p/>"Indeed, Marianne, I think you are mistaken. It is not Willoughby. The
person is not tall enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and has not his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) air."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has," cried Marianne, "I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) air, his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) coat,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) horse. I knew how soon he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would come."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked eagerly on as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke; and Elinor, to screen Marianne from
particularity, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt almost certain of its not being Willoughby,
quickened her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pace and kept up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). They were soon within thirty
yards of the gentleman. Marianne looked again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart sunk within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); and abruptly turning round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was hurrying back, when the voices
of both her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sisters were raised to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); a third, almost as well
known as Willoughby’s, joined them in begging her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to stop, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
turned round with surprise to see and welcome Edward Ferrars.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was the only person in the world who could at that moment be
forgiven for not being Willoughby; the only one who could have gained a
smile from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dispersed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tears to smile on _him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)_, and in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s happiness forgot for a time her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disappointment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) dismounted, and giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) horse to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) servant, walked back with
them to Barton, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was purposely coming to visit them.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was welcomed by them all with great cordiality, but especially by
Marianne, who showed more warmth of regard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) than
even Elinor herself. To Marianne, indeed, the meeting between Edward
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister was but a continuation of that unaccountable coldness
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had often observed at Norland in their mutual behaviour. On
Edward’s side, more particularly, there was a deficiency of all that a
lover ought to look and say on such an occasion. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was confused,
seemed scarcely sensible of pleasure in seeing them, looked neither
rapturous nor gay, said little but what was forced from him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) by
questions, and distinguished Elinor by no mark of affection. Marianne
saw and listened with increasing surprise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began almost to feel a
dislike of Edward; and it ended, as every feeling must end with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), by
carrying back her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) thoughts to Willoughby, whose manners formed a
contrast sufficiently striking to those of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) brother elect.

<p/>After a short silence which succeeded the first surprise and enquiries
of meeting, Marianne asked Edward if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) came directly from London. No,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been in Devonshire a fortnight.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A fortnight!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) repeated, surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being so long in the same
county with Elinor without seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) looked rather distressed as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) added, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been staying with
some friends near Plymouth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Have you been lately in Sussex?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I was at Norland about a month ago."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And how does dear, dear Norland look?"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear, dear Norland,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "probably looks much as it always
does at this time of the year. The woods and walks thickly covered with
dead leaves."

<p/>"Oh,<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>with what transporting sensation have I formerly
seen them fall! How have I delighted, as I walked, to see them driven
in showers about me by the wind! What feelings have they, the season,
the air altogether inspired! Now there is no one to regard them. They
are seen only as a nuisance, swept hastily off, and driven as much as
possible from the sight."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is not every one,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "who has your passion for dead
leaves."

<p/>"No; my feelings are not often shared, not often understood. But
_sometimes_ they are.<div class="bookquote">"—As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sunk into a reverie for a
few moments;—but rousing herself again, " (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>Now, Edward," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
calling his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) attention to the prospect, "here is Barton valley. Look up
to it, and be tranquil if you can. Look at those hills! Did you ever
see their equals? To the left is Barton park, amongst those woods and
plantations. You may see the end of the house. And there, beneath that
farthest hill, which rises with such grandeur, is our cottage."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a beautiful country,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) replied; "but these bottoms must be
dirty in winter."

<p/>"How can you think of dirt, with such objects before you?"

<p/>"Because,<div class="bookquote">" replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), smiling, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>among the rest of the objects before
me, I see a very dirty lane."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How strange!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne to herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) walked on.

<p/>"Have you an agreeable neighbourhood here? Are the Middletons pleasant
people?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, not all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>answered Marianne; "we could not be more unfortunately
situated."

<p/>"Marianne,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, " (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>how can you say so? How can you be so
unjust? They are a very respectable family, Mr. Ferrars; and towards us
have behaved in the friendliest manner. Have you forgot, Marianne, how
many pleasant days we have owed to them?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, in a low voice, "nor how many painful moments."

<p/>Elinor took no notice of this; and directing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attention to their
visitor, endeavoured to support something like discourse with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), by
talking of their present residence, its conveniences, &c. extorting
from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) occasional questions and remarks. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coldness and reserve
mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) severely; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was vexed and half angry; but resolving to
regulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) by the past rather than the present, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
avoided every appearance of resentment or displeasure, and treated him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) ought to be treated from the family connection.
