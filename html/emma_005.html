<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know what your opinion may be, Mrs. Weston,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, "of this great intimacy between Emma and Harriet Smith, but I think it a bad thing."

<p/>"A bad thing! Do you really think it a bad thing? why so?"

<p/>"I think they will neither of them do the other any good."

<p/>"You surprize me! Emma must do Harriet good: and by supplying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a new object of interest, Harriet may be said to do Emma good. I have been seeing their intimacy with the greatest pleasure. How very differently we feel! Not think they will do each other any good! This will certainly be the beginning of one of our quarrels about Emma, Mr. Knightley."

<p/>"Perhaps you think I am come on purpose to quarrel with you, knowing Weston to be out, and that you must still fight your own battle.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weston would undoubtedly support me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were here, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks exactly as I do on the subject. We were speaking of it only yesterday, and agreeing how fortunate it was for Emma, that there should be such a girl in Highbury for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to associate with. Mr. Knightley, I shall not allow you to be a fair judge in this case. You are so much used to live alone, that you do not know the value of a companion; and, perhaps no man can be a good judge of the comfort a woman feels in the society of one of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own sex, after being used to it all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) life. I can imagine your objection to Harriet Smith. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not the superior young woman which Emma's friend ought to be. But on the other hand, as Emma wants to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) better informed, it will be an inducement to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to read more herself. They will read together. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) means it, I know."

<p/>"Emma has been meaning to read more ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was twelve years old. I have seen a great many lists of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drawing-up at various times of books that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to read regularly through and very good lists they were very well chosen, and very neatly arranged sometimes alphabetically, and sometimes by some other rule. The list she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) drew up when only fourteen I remember thinking it did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judgment so much credit, that I preserved it some time; and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) may have made out a very good list now. But I have done with expecting any course of steady reading from Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will never submit to any thing requiring industry and patience, and a subjection of the fancy to the understanding. Where Miss Taylor failed to stimulate, I may safely affirm that Harriet Smith will do nothing. You never could persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to read half so much as you wished. You know you could not."

<p/>"I dare say,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that I thought so then; but since we have parted, I can never remember Emma's omitting to do any thing I wished."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is hardly any desiring to refresh such a memory as that,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, feelingly; and for a moment or two he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had done. "But I," he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon added, "who have had no such charm thrown over my senses, must still see, hear, and remember. Emma is spoiled by being the cleverest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family. At ten years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had the misfortune of being able to answer questions which puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister at seventeen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was always quick and assured: Isabella slow and diffident. And ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was twelve, Emma has been mistress of the house and of you all. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lost the only person able to cope with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) inherits her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mother's talents, and must have been under subjection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."

<p/>"I should have been sorry, Mr. Knightley, to be dependent on your recommendation, had I quitted Mr. Woodhouse's family and wanted another situation; I do not think you would have spoken a good word for me to any body. I am sure you always thought me unfit for the office I held."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), smiling. "You are better placed here; very fit for a wife, but not at all for a governess. But you were preparing yourself to be an excellent wife all the time you were at Hartfield. You might not give Emma such a complete education as your powers would seem to promise; but you were receiving a very good education from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), on the very material matrimonial point of submitting your own will, and doing as you were bid; and if Weston had asked me to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) a wife, I should certainly have named Miss Taylor."

<p/>"Thank you. There will be very little merit in making a good wife to such a man as Mr. Weston."

<p/>"Why, to own the truth, I am afraid you are rather thrown away, and that with every disposition to bear, there will be nothing to be borne. We will not despair, however. Weston may grow cross from the wantonness of comfort, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son may plague him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)."

<p/>"I hope not that. It is not likely. No, Mr. Knightley, do not foretell vexation from that quarter."

<p/>"Not I, indeed. I only name possibilities. I do not pretend to Emma's genius for foretelling and guessing. I hope, with all my heart, the young man may be a Weston in merit, and a Churchill in fortune. But Harriet Smith I have not half done about Harriet Smith. I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) the very worst sort of companion that Emma could possibly have. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows nothing herself, and looks upon Emma as knowing every thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a flatterer in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ways; and so much the worse, because undesigned. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ignorance is hourly flattery. How can Emma imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has any thing to learn herself, while Harriet is presenting such a delightful inferiority? And as for Harriet, I will venture to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cannot gain by the acquaintance. Hartfield will only put her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) out of conceit with all the other places she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) belongs to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) will grow just refined enough to be uncomfortable with those among whom birth and circumstances have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) home. I am much mistaken if Emma's doctrines give any strength of mind, or tend at all to make a girl adapt herself rationally to the varieties of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation in life. They only give a little polish."

<p/>"I either depend more upon Emma's good sense than you do, or am more anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present comfort; for I cannot lament the acquaintance. How well she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked last night!"

<p/>"Oh! you would rather talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, would you? Very well; I shall not attempt to deny Emma's being pretty."

<p/>"Pretty! say beautiful rather. Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than Emma altogether face and figure?"

<p/>"I do not know what I could imagine, but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers. But I am a partial old friend."

<p/>"Such an eye! the true hazle eye and so brilliant! regular features, open countenance, with a complexion! oh! what a bloom of full health, and such a pretty height and size; such a firm and upright figure! There is health, not merely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bloom, but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) air, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) glance. One hears sometimes of a child being 'the picture of health;' now, Emma always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is loveliness itself. Mr. Knightley, is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have not a fault to find with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied. "I think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all you describe. I love to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and I will add this praise, that I do not think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) personally vain. Considering how very handsome she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) appears to be little occupied with it; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) vanity lies another way. Mrs. Weston, I am not to be talked out of my dislike of Harriet Smith, or my dread of its doing them both harm."

<p/>"And I, Mr. Knightley, am equally stout in my confidence of its not doing them any harm. With all dear Emma's little faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an excellent creature. Where shall we see a better daughter, or a kinder sister, or a truer friend? No, no; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has qualities which may be trusted; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will never lead any one really wrong; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will make no lasting blunder; where Emma errs once, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is in the right a hundred times."

<p/>"Very well; I will not plague you any more. Emma shall be an angel, and I will keep my spleen to myself till Christmas brings John and Isabella. John loves Emma with a reasonable and therefore not a blind affection, and Isabella always thinks as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) does; except when he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is not quite frightened enough about the children. I am sure of having their opinions with me."

<p/>"I know that you all love her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really too well to be unjust or unkind; but excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if I take the liberty (I consider myself, you know, as having somewhat of the privilege of speech that Emma's mother might have had) the liberty of hinting that I do not think any possible good can arise from Harriet Smith's intimacy being made a matter of much discussion among you. Pray excuse me; but supposing any little inconvenience may be apprehended from the intimacy, it cannot be expected that Emma, accountable to nobody but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, who perfectly approves the acquaintance, should put an end to it, so long as it is a source of pleasure to herself. It has been so many years my province to give advice, that you cannot be surprized, Mr. Knightley, at this little remains of office."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not at all,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); "I am much obliged to you for it. It is very good advice, and it shall have a better fate than your advice has often found; for it shall be attended to."

<p/>"Mrs. John Knightley is easily alarmed, and might be made unhappy about her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) sister."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Be satisfied,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), "I will not raise any outcry. I will keep my ill-humour to myself. I have a very sincere interest in Emma. Isabella does not seem more my sister; has never excited a greater interest; perhaps hardly so great. There is an anxiety, a curiosity in what one feels for Emma. I wonder what will become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So do I,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston gently, "very much."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) always declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will never marry, which, of course, means just nothing at all. But I have no idea that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has yet ever seen a man she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cared for. It would not be a bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be very much in love with a proper object. I should like to see Emma in love, and in some doubt of a return; it would do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good. But there is nobody hereabouts to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) goes so seldom from home."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There does, indeed, seem as little to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to break her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolution at present,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, "as can well be; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is so happy at Hartfield, I cannot wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be forming any attachment which would be creating such difficulties on poor Mr. Woodhouse's account. I do not recommend matrimony at present to Emma, though I mean no slight to the state, I assure you."

<p/>Part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meaning was to conceal some favourite thoughts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own and Mr. Weston's on the subject, as much as possible. There were wishes at Randalls respecting Emma's destiny, but it was not desirable to have them suspected; and the quiet transition which Mr. Knightley soon afterwards made to <div class="bookquote">"What does Weston think of the weather; shall we have rain?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had nothing more to say or surmise about Hartfield.
