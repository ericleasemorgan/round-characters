<p/>How is the consternation of the party to be described? To the greater
number it was a moment of absolute horror. Sir Thomas in the house! All
felt the instantaneous conviction. Not a hope of imposition or mistake
was harboured anywhere. Julia’s looks were an evidence of the fact that
made it indisputable; and after the first starts and exclamations, not
a word was spoken for half a minute: each with an altered countenance
was looking at some other, and almost each was feeling it a stroke the
most unwelcome, most ill-timed, most appalling! Mr. Yates might
consider it only as a vexatious interruption for the evening, and Mr.
Rushworth might imagine it a blessing; but every other heart was
sinking under some degree of self-condemnation or undefined alarm,
every other heart was suggesting, "What will become of us? what is to
be done now?" It was a terrible pause; and terrible to every ear were
the corroborating sounds of opening doors and passing footsteps.

<p/>Julia was the first to move and speak again. Jealousy and bitterness
had been suspended: selfishness was lost in the common cause; but at
the moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) appearance, Frederick was listening with looks of
devotion to Agatha’s narrative, and pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) heart; and
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) could notice this, and see that, in spite of the shock
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) words, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) still kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) station and retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) sister’s hand,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) wounded heart swelled again with injury, and looking as red as she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)
had been white before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) turned out of the room, saying, <div class="bookquote">"_I_ need
not be afraid of appearing before him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) going roused the rest; and at the same moment the two brothers
stepped forward, feeling the necessity of doing something. A very few
words between them were sufficient. The case admitted no difference of
opinion: they must go to the drawing-room directly. Maria joined them
with the same intent, just then the stoutest of the three; for the very
circumstance which had driven Julia away was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) the sweetest
support. Henry Crawford’s retaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hand at such a moment, a moment
of such peculiar proof and importance, was worth ages of doubt and
anxiety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hailed it as an earnest of the most serious determination,
and was equal even to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father. They walked off, utterly
heedless of Mr. Rushworth’s repeated question of, "Shall I go too? Had
not I better go too? Will not it be right for me to go too?<div class="bookquote">" but they
were no sooner through the door than Henry Crawford undertook to answer
the anxious inquiry, and, encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by all means to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
respects to Sir Thomas without delay, sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) after the others with
delighted haste.

<p/>Fanny was left with only the Crawfords and Mr. Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been
quite overlooked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) claims
on Sir Thomas’s affection was much too humble to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) any idea of
classing herself with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was glad to remain behind and
gain a little breathing-time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agitation and alarm exceeded all that
was endured by the rest, by the right of a disposition which not even
innocence could keep from suffering. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was nearly fainting: all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
former habitual dread of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was returning, and with it
compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) and for almost every one of the party on the
development before him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), with solicitude on Edmund’s account
indescribable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had found a seat, where in excessive trembling she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was enduring all these fearful thoughts, while the other three, no
longer under any restraint, were giving vent to their feelings of
vexation, lamenting over such an unlooked-for premature arrival as a
most untoward event, and without mercy wishing poor Sir Thomas had been
twice as long on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage, or were still in Antigua.

<p/>The Crawfords were more warm on the subject than Mr. Yates, from better
understanding the family, and judging more clearly of the mischief that
must ensue. The ruin of the play was to them a certainty: they felt the
total destruction of the scheme to be inevitably at hand; while Mr.
Yates considered it only as a temporary interruption, a disaster for
the evening, and could even suggest the possibility of the rehearsal
being renewed after tea, when the bustle of receiving Sir Thomas were
over, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be at leisure to be amused by it. The Crawfords
laughed at the idea; and having soon agreed on the propriety of their
walking quietly home and leaving the family to themselves, proposed Mr.
Yates’s accompanying them and spending the evening at the Parsonage.
But Mr. Yates, having never been with those who thought much of
parental claims, or family confidence, could not perceive that anything
of the kind was necessary; and therefore, thanking them, said, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
preferred remaining where he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) might pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) respects to the
old gentleman handsomely since he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) _was_ come; and besides, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) did not
think it would be fair by the others to have everybody run away."

<p/>Fanny was just beginning to collect herself, and to feel that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
staid longer behind it might seem disrespectful, when this point was
settled, and being commissioned with the brother and sister’s apology,
saw them preparing to go as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) quitted the room herself to perform the
dreadful duty of appearing before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncle.

<p/>Too soon did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) find herself at the drawing-room door; and after
pausing a moment for what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) knew would not come, for a courage which
the outside of no door had ever supplied to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) turned the lock in
desperation, and the lights of the drawing-room, and all the collected
family, were before her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) entered, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own name caught her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ear.
Sir Thomas was at that moment looking round him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and saying, "But where
is Fanny? Why do not I see my little Fanny?"—and on perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
came forward with a kindness which astonished and penetrated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dear Fanny, kissing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affectionately, and observing
with decided pleasure how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was grown! Fanny knew not how to
feel, nor where to look. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite oppressed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had never been so
kind, so _very_ kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) manner seemed changed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
voice was quick from the agitation of joy; and all that had been awful
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) dignity seemed lost in tenderness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) led her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nearer the light
and looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again—inquired particularly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) health, and
then, correcting himself, observed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) need not inquire, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
appearance spoke sufficiently on that point. A fine blush having
succeeded the previous paleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was justified in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) equal improvement in health and beauty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) inquired next
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) family, especially William: and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) kindness altogether was
such as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reproach herself for loving him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) so little, and
thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) return a misfortune; and when, on having courage to lift
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was grown thinner, and had the
burnt, fagged, worn look of fatigue and a hot climate, every tender
feeling was increased, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was miserable in considering how much
unsuspected vexation was probably ready to burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Sir Thomas was indeed the life of the party, who at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) suggestion now
seated themselves round the fire. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had the best right to be the
talker; and the delight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sensations in being again in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own
house, in the centre of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, after such a separation, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
communicative and chatty in a very unusual degree; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was ready to
give every information as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) voyage, and answer every question of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) two sons almost before it was put. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) business in Antigua had
latterly been prosperously rapid, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) came directly from Liverpool,
having had an opportunity of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage thither in a private
vessel, instead of waiting for the packet; and all the little
particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) proceedings and events, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arrivals and departures,
were most promptly delivered, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sat by Lady Bertram and looked with
heartfelt satisfaction on the faces around him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)—interrupting himself
more than once, however, to remark on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good fortune in finding them
all at home—coming unexpectedly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did—all collected together
exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could have wished, but dared not depend on. Mr. Rushworth
was not forgotten: a most friendly reception and warmth of hand-shaking
had already met him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and with pointed attention he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was now included in
the objects most intimately connected with Mansfield. There was nothing
disagreeable in Mr. Rushworth’s appearance, and Sir Thomas was liking
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) already.

<p/>By not one of the circle was he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) listened to with such unbroken,
unalloyed enjoyment as by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife, who was really extremely happy to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and whose feelings were so warmed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sudden arrival as to
place her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nearer agitation than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been for the last twenty years.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had been _almost_ fluttered for a few minutes, and still remained
so sensibly animated as to put away her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) work, move Pug from her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side,
and give all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) attention and all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) sofa to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband.
She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had no anxieties for anybody to cloud _her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)_ pleasure: her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own time
had been irreproachably spent during his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) absence: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had done a great
deal of carpet-work, and made many yards of fringe; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have
answered as freely for the good conduct and useful pursuits of all the
young people as for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own. It was so agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
again, and hear him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) talk, to have her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ear amused and her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) whole
comprehension filled by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) narratives, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) began particularly to
feel how dreadfully she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must have missed him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), and how impossible it
would have been for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to bear a lengthened absence.

<p/>Mrs. Norris was by no means to be compared in happiness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister.
Not that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ was incommoded by many fears of Sir Thomas’s
disapprobation when the present state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) house should be known, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) judgment had been so blinded that, except by the instinctive
caution with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had whisked away Mr. Rushworth’s pink satin
cloak as her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) brother-in-law entered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could hardly be said to shew
any sign of alarm; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was vexed by the _manner_ of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) return. It
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nothing to do. Instead of being sent for out of the room,
and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) first, and having to spread the happy news through the
house, Sir Thomas, with a very reasonable dependence, perhaps, on the
nerves of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife and children, had sought no confidant but the
butler, and had been following him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) almost instantaneously into the
drawing-room. Mrs. Norris felt herself defrauded of an office on which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had always depended, whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) arrival or his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) death were to be
the thing unfolded; and was now trying to be in a bustle without having
anything to bustle about, and labouring to be important where nothing
was wanted but tranquillity and silence. Would Sir Thomas have
consented to eat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) might have gone to the housekeeper with
troublesome directions, and insulted the footmen with injunctions of
despatch; but Sir Thomas resolutely declined all dinner: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would take
nothing, nothing till tea came—he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would rather wait for tea. Still Mrs.
Norris was at intervals urging something different; and in the most
interesting moment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) passage to England, when the alarm of a
French privateer was at the height, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) burst through his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) recital with
the proposal of soup. "Sure, my dear Sir Thomas, a basin of soup would
be a much better thing for you than tea. Do have a basin of soup.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sir Thomas could not be provoked. " (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>Still the same anxiety for
everybody’s comfort, my dear Mrs. Norris," was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) answer. "But indeed
I would rather have nothing but tea."

<p/>"Well, then, Lady Bertram, suppose you speak for tea directly; suppose
you hurry Baddeley a little; he (<font color='blue'><b>Baddeley</b></font>) seems behindhand to-night.<div class="bookquote">" She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) carried
this point, and Sir Thomas’s narrative proceeded.

<p/>At length there was a pause. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) immediate communications were
exhausted, and it seemed enough to be looking joyfully around him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), now
at one, now at another of the beloved circle; but the pause was not
long: in the elation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) spirits Lady Bertram became talkative, and
what were the sensations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children upon hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) say, " (<font color='red'><b>the people</b></font>)</div>How do
you think the young people have been amusing themselves lately, Sir
Thomas? They have been acting. We have been all alive with acting."

<p/>"Indeed! and what have you been acting?"

<p/>"Oh! they’ll tell you all about it."

<p/>"The _all_ will soon be told," cried Tom hastily, and with affected
unconcern; "but it is not worth while to bore my father with it now.
You will hear enough of it to-morrow, sir. We have just been trying, by
way of doing something, and amusing my mother, just within the last
week, to get up a few scenes, a mere trifle. We have had such incessant
rains almost since October began, that we have been nearly confined to
the house for days together. I have hardly taken out a gun since the
3rd. Tolerable sport the first three days, but there has been no
attempting anything since. The first day I went over Mansfield Wood,
and Edmund took the copses beyond Easton, and we brought home six brace
between us, and might each have killed six times as many, but we
respect your pheasants, sir, I assure you, as much as you could desire.
I do not think you will find your woods by any means worse stocked than
they were. _I_ never saw Mansfield Wood so full of pheasants in my life
as this year. I hope you will take a day’s sport there yourself, sir,
soon."

<p/>For the present the danger was over, and Fanny’s sick feelings
subsided; but when tea was soon afterwards brought in, and Sir Thomas,
getting up, said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not be any longer in the
house without just looking into his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own dear room, every agitation was
returning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was gone before anything had been said to prepare him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for
the change he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must find there; and a pause of alarm followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
disappearance. Edmund was the first to speak—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Something must be done,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is time to think of our visitors,"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, still feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
hand pressed to Henry Crawford’s heart, and caring little for anything
else. <div class="bookquote">"Where did you leave Miss Crawford, Fanny?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny told of their departure, and delivered their message.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Then poor Yates is all alone,"  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>cried Tom. "I will go and fetch him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
will be no bad assistant when it all comes out."

<p/>To the theatre he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) went, and reached it just in time to witness the
first meeting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friend. Sir Thomas had been a good
deal surprised to find candles burning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) room; and on casting his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
eye round it, to see other symptoms of recent habitation and a general
air of confusion in the furniture. The removal of the bookcase from
before the billiard-room door struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) especially, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had
scarcely more than time to feel astonished at all this, before there
were sounds from the billiard-room to astonish him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) still farther. Some
one was talking there in a very loud accent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did not know the
voice—more than talking—almost hallooing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stepped to the door,
rejoicing at that moment in having the means of immediate
communication, and, opening it, found himself on the stage of a
theatre, and opposed to a ranting young man, who appeared likely to
knock him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down backwards. At the very moment of Yates perceiving Sir
Thomas, and giving perhaps the very best start he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had ever given in the
whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) rehearsals, Tom Bertram entered at the other end of
the room; and never had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) found greater difficulty in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) father’s looks of solemnity and amazement on this his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
first appearance on any stage, and the gradual metamorphosis of the
impassioned Baron Wildenheim into the well-bred and easy Mr. Yates,
making his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) bow and apology to Sir Thomas Bertram, was such an
exhibition, such a piece of true acting, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not have lost upon
any account. It would be the last—in all probability—the last scene on
that stage; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was sure there could not be a finer. The house would
close with the greatest eclat.

<p/>There was little time, however, for the indulgence of any images of
merriment. It was necessary for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to step forward, too, and assist
the introduction, and with many awkward sensations he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) best. Sir
Thomas received Mr. Yates with all the appearance of cordiality which
was due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own character, but was really as far from pleased with
the necessity of the acquaintance as with the manner of its
commencement. Mr. Yates’s family and connexions were sufficiently known
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) to render his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) introduction as the <div class="bookquote">"particular friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>another
of the hundred particular friends of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) son, exceedingly unwelcome;
and it needed all the felicity of being again at home, and all the
forbearance it could supply, to save Sir Thomas from anger on finding
himself thus bewildered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own house, making part of a ridiculous
exhibition in the midst of theatrical nonsense, and forced in so
untoward a moment to admit the acquaintance of a young man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) felt
sure of disapproving, and whose easy indifference and volubility in the
course of the first five minutes seemed to mark him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the most at home of
the two.

<p/>Tom understood his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father’s thoughts, and heartily wishing he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) might be
always as well disposed to give them but partial expression, began to
see, more clearly than he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had ever done before, that there might be
some ground of offence, that there might be some reason for the glance
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father gave towards the ceiling and stucco of the room; and that
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) inquired with mild gravity after the fate of the
billiard-table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) was not proceeding beyond a very allowable
curiosity. A few minutes were enough for such unsatisfactory sensations
on each side; and Sir Thomas having exerted himself so far as to speak
a few words of calm approbation in reply to an eager appeal of Mr.
Yates, as to the happiness of the arrangement, the three gentlemen
returned to the drawing-room together, Sir Thomas with an increase of
gravity which was not lost on all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I come from your theatre,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) composedly, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sat down; "I
found myself in it rather unexpectedly. Its vicinity to my own room—but
in every respect, indeed, it took me by surprise, as I had not the
smallest suspicion of your acting having assumed so serious a
character. It appears a neat job, however, as far as I could judge by
candlelight, and does my friend Christopher Jackson credit." And then
he (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) would have changed the subject, and sipped his (<font color='blue'><b>Jackson</b></font>) coffee in peace over
domestic matters of a calmer hue; but Mr. Yates, without discernment to
catch Sir Thomas’s meaning, or diffidence, or delicacy, or discretion
enough to allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to lead the discourse while he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mingled among the
others with the least obtrusiveness himself, would keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) on the
topic of the theatre, would torment him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) with questions and remarks
relative to it, and finally would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hear the whole history of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) disappointment at Ecclesford. Sir Thomas listened most politely,
but found much to offend his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) ideas of decorum, and confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
ill-opinion of Mr. Yates’s habits of thinking, from the beginning to
the end of the story; and when it was over, could give him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) no other
assurance of sympathy than what a slight bow conveyed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This was, in fact, the origin of _our_ acting,"  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom, after a
moment’s thought. "My friend Yates brought the infection from
Ecclesford, and it spread—as those things always spread, you know,
sir—the faster, probably, from _your_ having so often encouraged the
sort of thing in us formerly. It was like treading old ground again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Yates took the subject from his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friend as soon as possible, and
immediately gave Sir Thomas an account of what they had done and were
doing: told him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) of the gradual increase of their views, the happy
conclusion of their first difficulties, and present promising state of
affairs; relating everything with so blind an interest as made him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not
only totally unconscious of the uneasy movements of many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) friends
as they sat, the change of countenance, the fidget, the hem! of
unquietness, but prevented him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) even from seeing the expression of the
face on which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own eyes were fixed—from seeing Sir Thomas’s dark
brow contract as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looked with inquiring earnestness at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters
and Edmund, dwelling particularly on the latter, and speaking a
language, a remonstrance, a reproof, which _he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ felt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heart. Not
less acutely was it felt by Fanny, who had edged back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) chair behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s end of the sofa, and, screened from notice herself, saw all
that was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Such a look of reproach at Edmund from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
father she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never have expected to witness; and to feel that it
was in any degree deserved was an aggravation indeed. Sir Thomas’s look
implied, " (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>On your judgment, Edmund, I depended; what have you been
about?" She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knelt in spirit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bosom swelled to
utter, "Oh, not to _him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)_! Look so to all the others, but not to _him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)_!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Yates was still talking. " (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>To own the truth, Sir Thomas, we were in
the middle of a rehearsal when you arrived this evening. We were going
through the three first acts, and not unsuccessfully upon the whole.
Our company is now so dispersed, from the Crawfords being gone home,
that nothing more can be done to-night; but if you will give us the
honour of your company to-morrow evening, I should not be afraid of the
result. We bespeak your indulgence, you understand, as young
performers; we bespeak your indulgence."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My indulgence shall be given, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>replied Sir Thomas gravely, "but
without any other rehearsal." And with a relenting smile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) added, "I
come home to be happy and indulgent.<div class="bookquote">" Then turning away towards any or
all of the rest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tranquilly said, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Miss</b></font>)</div>Mr. and Miss Crawford were
mentioned in my last letters from Mansfield. Do you find them agreeable
acquaintance?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Tom was the only one at all ready with an answer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) being entirely
without particular regard for either, without jealousy either in love
or acting, could speak very handsomely of both. " (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Crawford was a
most pleasant, gentleman-like man; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister a sweet, pretty, elegant,
lively girl.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Rushworth could be silent no longer. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is not
gentleman-like, considering; but you should tell your father he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is not
above five feet eight, or he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be expecting a well-looking man.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sir Thomas did not quite understand this, and looked with some surprise
at the speaker.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>If I must say what I think," continued Mr. Rushworth, "in my opinion
it is very disagreeable to be always rehearsing. It is having too much
of a good thing. I am not so fond of acting as I was at first. I think
we are a great deal better employed, sitting comfortably here among
ourselves, and doing nothing."

<p/>Sir Thomas looked again, and then replied with an approving smile, "I
am happy to find our sentiments on this subject so much the same. It
gives me sincere satisfaction. That I should be cautious and
quick-sighted, and feel many scruples which my children do _not_ feel,
is perfectly natural; and equally so that my value for domestic
tranquillity, for a home which shuts out noisy pleasures, should much
exceed theirs. But at your time of life to feel all this, is a most
favourable circumstance for yourself, and for everybody connected with
you; and I am sensible of the importance of having an ally of such
weight."

<p/>Sir Thomas meant to be giving Mr. Rushworth’s opinion in better words
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could find himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was aware that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must not expect a
genius in Mr. Rushworth; but as a well-judging, steady young man, with
better notions than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) elocution would do justice to, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intended to
value him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very highly. It was impossible for many of the others not to
smile. Mr. Rushworth hardly knew what to do with so much meaning; but
by looking, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) really felt, most exceedingly pleased with Sir
Thomas’s good opinion, and saying scarcely anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) best
towards preserving that good opinion a little longer.
