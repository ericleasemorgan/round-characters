<p/>A quarter of an hour, twenty minutes, passed away, and Fanny was still
thinking of Edmund, Miss Crawford, and herself, without interruption
from any one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to be surprised at being left so long, and to
listen with an anxious desire of hearing their steps and their voices
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) listened, and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard voices and feet
approaching; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had just satisfied herself that it was not those
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted, when Miss Bertram, Mr. Rushworth, and Mr. Crawford issued
from the same path which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had trod herself, and were before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Price all alone"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"My dear Fanny, how comes this?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the
first salutations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) story. "Poor dear Fanny,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousin, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>how ill you have been used by them! You had better have staid
with us."

<p/>Then seating herself with a gentleman on each side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resumed the
conversation which had engaged them before, and discussed the
possibility of improvements with much animation. Nothing was fixed on;
but Henry Crawford was full of ideas and projects, and, generally
speaking, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) proposed was immediately approved, first by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and then by Mr. Rushworth, whose principal business seemed to be to
hear the others, and who scarcely risked an original thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own
beyond a wish that they had seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) friend Smith’s place.

<p/>After some minutes spent in this way, Miss Bertram, observing the iron
gate, expressed a wish of passing through it into the park, that their
views and their plans might be more comprehensive. It was the very
thing of all others to be wished, it was the best, it was the only way
of proceeding with any advantage, in Henry Crawford’s opinion; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
directly saw a knoll not half a mile off, which would give them exactly
the requisite command of the house. Go therefore they must to that
knoll, and through that gate; but the gate was locked. Mr. Rushworth
wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had brought the key; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been very near thinking whether
he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) should not bring the key; he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would never come
without the key again; but still this did not remove the present evil.
They could not get through; and as Miss Bertram’s inclination for so
doing did by no means lessen, it ended in Mr. Rushworth’s declaring
outright that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) would go and fetch the key. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) set off accordingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is undoubtedly the best thing we can do now, as we are so far from
the house already,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Crawford, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was gone.

<p/>"Yes, there is nothing else to be done. But now, sincerely, do not you
find the place altogether worse than you expected?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, indeed, far otherwise. I find it better, grander, more complete in
its style, though that style may not be the best. And to tell you the
truth,"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>speaking rather lower, "I do not think that _I_ shall ever see
Sotherton again with so much pleasure as I do now. Another summer will
hardly improve it to me."

<p/>After a moment’s embarrassment the lady replied, "You are too much a
man of the world not to see with the eyes of the world. If other people
think Sotherton improved, I have no doubt that you will."

<p/>"I am afraid I am not quite so much the man of the world as might be
good for me in some points. My feelings are not quite so evanescent,
nor my memory of the past under such easy dominion as one finds to be
the case with men of the world."

<p/>This was followed by a short silence. Miss Bertram began again. "You
seemed to enjoy your drive here very much this morning. I was glad to
see you so well entertained. You and Julia were laughing the whole
way."

<p/>"Were we? Yes, I believe we were; but I have not the least recollection
at what. Oh! I believe I was relating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) some ridiculous stories of
an old Irish groom of my uncle’s. Your sister loves to laugh."

<p/>"You think her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) more light-hearted than I am?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"More easily amused,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">"consequently, you know,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>smiling,
"better company. I could not have hoped to entertain you with Irish
anecdotes during a ten miles’ drive."

<p/>"Naturally, I believe, I am as lively as Julia, but I have more to
think of now."

<p/>"You have, undoubtedly; and there are situations in which very high
spirits would denote insensibility. Your prospects, however, are too
fair to justify want of spirits. You have a very smiling scene before
you."

<p/>"Do you mean literally or figuratively? Literally, I conclude. Yes,
certainly, the sun shines, and the park looks very cheerful. But
unluckily that iron gate, that ha-ha, give me a feeling of restraint
and hardship. <div class="bookquote">‘I cannot get out,’  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>as the starling said.<div class="bookquote">" As she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) spoke,
and it was with expression, she (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) walked to the gate: he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>).
" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Rushworth</b></font>)</div>Mr. Rushworth is so long fetching this key!"

<p/>"And for the world you would not get out without the key and without
Mr. Rushworth’s authority and protection, or I think you might with
little difficulty pass round the edge of the gate, here, with my
assistance; I think it might be done, if you really wished to be more
at large, and could allow yourself to think it not prohibited."

<p/>"Prohibited! nonsense! I certainly can get out that way, and I will.
Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment, you know; we shall not be out
of sight."

<p/>"Or if we are, Miss Price will be so good as to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) will
find us near that knoll: the grove of oak on the knoll.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny, feeling all this to be wrong, could not help making an effort to
prevent it. " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bertram/Bertram</b></font>)</div>You will hurt yourself, Miss Bertram," she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cried; "you
will certainly hurt yourself against those spikes; you will tear your
gown; you will be in danger of slipping into the ha-ha. You had better
not go."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cousin was safe on the other side while these words were spoken,
and, smiling with all the good-humour of success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) said, "Thank you,
my dear Fanny, but I and my gown are alive and well, and so good-bye."

<p/>Fanny was again left to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) solitude, and with no increase of pleasant
feelings, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sorry for almost all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen and heard,
astonished at Miss Bertram, and angry with Mr. Crawford. By taking a
circuitous, and, as it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), very unreasonable direction to
the knoll, they were soon beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) eye; and for some minutes longer
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) remained without sight or sound of any companion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) seemed to
have the little wood all to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could almost have thought that
Edmund and Miss Crawford had left it, but that it was impossible for
Edmund to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so entirely.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was again roused from disagreeable musings by sudden footsteps:
somebody was coming at a quick pace down the principal walk. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
expected Mr. Rushworth, but it was Julia, who, hot and out of breath,
and with a look of disappointment, cried out on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), "Heyday!
Where are the others? I thought Maria and Mr. Crawford were with you.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny explained.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A pretty trick, upon my word! I cannot see them anywhere," looking
eagerly into the park. "But they cannot be very far off, and I think I
am equal to as much as Maria, even without help."

<p/>"But, Julia, Mr. Rushworth will be here in a moment with the key. Do
wait for Mr. Rushworth."

<p/>"Not I, indeed. I have had enough of the family for one morning. Why,
child, I have but this moment escaped from his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) horrible mother. Such a
penance as I have been enduring, while you were sitting here so
composed and so happy! It might have been as well, perhaps, if you had
been in my place, but you always contrive to keep out of these
scrapes.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This was a most unjust reflection, but Fanny could allow for it, and
let it pass: Julia was vexed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) temper was hasty; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) felt
that it would not last, and therefore, taking no notice, only asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had not seen Mr. Rushworth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Yes, yes, we saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was posting away as if upon life and death,
and could but just spare time to tell us his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) errand, and where you all
were."

<p/>"It is a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) should have so much trouble for nothing."

<p/>"_That_ is Miss Maria’s concern. I am not obliged to punish myself for
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)_ sins. The mother I could not avoid, as long as my tiresome aunt
was dancing about with the housekeeper, but the son I _can_ get away
from."

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) immediately scrambled across the fence, and walked away, not
attending to Fanny’s last question of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen anything of
Miss Crawford and Edmund. The sort of dread in which Fanny now sat of
seeing Mr. Rushworth prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thinking so much of their continued
absence, however, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might have done. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had been
very ill-used, and was quite unhappy in having to communicate what had
passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) within five minutes after Julia’s exit; and
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) made the best of the story, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was evidently mortified and
displeased in no common degree. At first he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) scarcely said anything; his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
looks only expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) extreme surprise and vexation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) walked
to the gate and stood there, without seeming to know what to do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They desired me to stay—my cousin Maria charged me to say that you
would find them at that knoll, or thereabouts."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not believe I shall go any farther,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sullenly; "I see
nothing of them. By the time I get to the knoll they may be gone
somewhere else. I have had walking enough.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sat down with a most gloomy countenance by Fanny.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am very sorry," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); "it is very unlucky." And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longed to be
able to say something more to the purpose.

<p/>After an interval of silence, <div class="bookquote">"I think they might as well have staid
for me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Bertram thought you would follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I should not have had to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had staid."

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>This could not be denied, and Fanny was silenced. After another pause,
he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) went on—"Pray, Miss Price, are you such a great admirer of this Mr.
Crawford as some people are? For my part, I can see nothing in him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)."

<p/>"I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at all handsome."

<p/>"Handsome! Nobody can call such an undersized man handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not
five foot nine. I should not wonder if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not more than five foot
eight. I think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an ill-looking fellow. In my opinion, these
Crawfords are no addition at all. We did very well without them.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>A small sigh escaped Fanny here, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to contradict
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>If I had made any difficulty about fetching the key, there might have
been some excuse, but I went the very moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted it."

<p/>"Nothing could be more obliging than your manner, I am sure, and I dare
say you walked as fast as you could; but still it is some distance, you
know, from this spot to the house, quite into the house; and when
people are waiting, they are bad judges of time, and every half minute
seems like five."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) got up and walked to the gate again, and "wished he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had had the key
about him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at the time." Fanny thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) discerned in his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) standing
there an indication of relenting, which encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to another
attempt, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said, therefore, "It is a pity you should not join
them. They expected to have a better view of the house from that part
of the park, and will be thinking how it may be improved; and nothing
of that sort, you know, can be settled without you."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself more successful in sending away than in retaining a
companion. Mr. Rushworth was worked on. <div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), "if you really
think I had better go: it would be foolish to bring the key for
nothing." And letting himself out, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) walked off without farther
ceremony.

<p/>Fanny’s thoughts were now all engrossed by the two who had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so
long ago, and getting quite impatient, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolved to go in search of
them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) followed their steps along the bottom walk, and had just
turned up into another, when the voice and the laugh of Miss Crawford
once more caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ear; the sound approached, and a few more windings
brought them before her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). They were just returned into the wilderness
from the park, to which a sidegate, not fastened, had tempted them very
soon after their leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and they had been across a portion of the
park into the very avenue which Fanny had been hoping the whole morning
to reach at last, and had been sitting down under one of the trees.
This was their history. It was evident that they had been spending
their time pleasantly, and were not aware of the length of their
absence. Fanny’s best consolation was in being assured that Edmund had
wished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very much, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should certainly have come back
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not been tired already; but this was not quite
sufficient to do away with the pain of having been left a whole hour,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had talked of only a few minutes, nor to banish the sort of
curiosity she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt to know what they had been conversing about all that
time; and the result of the whole was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disappointment and
depression, as they prepared by general agreement to return to the
house.

<p/>On reaching the bottom of the steps to the terrace, Mrs. Rushworth and
Mrs. Norris presented themselves at the top, just ready for the
wilderness, at the end of an hour and a half from their leaving the
house. Mrs. Norris had been too well employed to move faster. Whatever
cross-accidents had occurred to intercept the pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nieces,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had found a morning of complete enjoyment; for the housekeeper,
after a great many courtesies on the subject of pheasants, had taken
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to the dairy, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) all about their cows, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) the
receipt for a famous cream cheese; and since Julia’s leaving them they
had been met by the gardener, with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had made a most
satisfactory acquaintance, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had set him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) right as to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
grandson’s illness, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that it was an ague, and promised him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
a charm for it; and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), in return, had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) all his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) choicest
nursery of plants, and actually presented her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) with a very curious
specimen of heath.

<p/>On this _rencontre_ they all returned to the house together, there to
lounge away the time as they could with sofas, and chit-chat, and
Quarterly Reviews, till the return of the others, and the arrival of
dinner. It was late before the Miss Bertrams and the two gentlemen came
in, and their ramble did not appear to have been more than partially
agreeable, or at all productive of anything useful with regard to the
object of the day. By their own accounts they had been all walking
after each other, and the junction which had taken place at last
seemed, to Fanny’s observation, to have been as much too late for
re-establishing harmony, as it confessedly had been for determining on
any alteration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at Julia and Mr. Rushworth,
that hers was not the only dissatisfied bosom amongst them: there was
gloom on the face of each. Mr. Crawford and Miss Bertram were much more
gay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was taking particular pains, during
dinner, to do away any little resentment of the other two, and restore
general good-humour.

<p/>Dinner was soon followed by tea and coffee, a ten miles’ drive home
allowed no waste of hours; and from the time of their sitting down to
table, it was a quick succession of busy nothings till the carriage
came to the door, and Mrs. Norris, having fidgeted about, and obtained
a few pheasants’ eggs and a cream cheese from the housekeeper, and made
abundance of civil speeches to Mrs. Rushworth, was ready to lead the
way. At the same moment Mr. Crawford, approaching Julia, said, <div class="bookquote">"I hope
I am not to lose my companion, unless she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) is afraid of the evening air
in so exposed a seat."  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>The request had not been foreseen, but was very
graciously received, and Julia’s day was likely to end almost as well
as it began. Miss Bertram had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) mind to something different,
and was a little disappointed; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) conviction of being really the
one preferred comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) under it, and enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to receive Mr.
Rushworth’s parting attentions as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was certainly better
pleased to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) into the barouche than to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in ascending
the box, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) complacency seemed confirmed by the arrangement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Fanny, this has been a fine day for you, upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Norris, as they drove through the park. "Nothing but pleasure from
beginning to end! I am sure you ought to be very much obliged to your
aunt Bertram and me for contriving to let you go. A pretty good day’s
amusement you have had!"

<p/>Maria was just discontented enough to say directly, "I think _you_ have
done pretty well yourself, ma’am. Your lap seems full of good things,
and here is a basket of something between us which has been knocking my
elbow unmercifully."

<p/>"My dear, it is only a beautiful little heath, which that nice old
gardener would make me take; but if it is in your way, I will have it
in my lap directly. There, Fanny, you shall carry that parcel for me;
take great care of it: do not let it fall; it is a cream cheese, just
like the excellent one we had at dinner. Nothing would satisfy that
good old Mrs. Whitaker, but my taking one of the cheeses. I stood out
as long as I could, till the tears almost came into her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) eyes, and I
knew it was just the sort that my sister would be delighted with. That
Mrs. Whitaker is a treasure! She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) was quite shocked when I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)
whether wine was allowed at the second table, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) has turned away
two housemaids for wearing white gowns. Take care of the cheese, Fanny.
Now I can manage the other parcel and the basket very well."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What else have you been spunging?"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, half-pleased that
Sotherton should be so complimented.

<p/>"Spunging, my dear! It is nothing but four of those beautiful
pheasants’ eggs, which Mrs. Whitaker would quite force upon me: she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>)
would not take a denial. She (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) said it must be such an amusement to me,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Whitaker</b></font>) understood I lived quite alone, to have a few living creatures
of that sort; and so to be sure it will. I shall get the dairymaid to
set them under the first spare hen, and if they come to good I can have
them moved to my own house and borrow a coop; and it will be a great
delight to me in my lonely hours to attend to them. And if I have good
luck, your mother shall have some."

<p/>It was a beautiful evening, mild and still, and the drive was as
pleasant as the serenity of Nature could make it; but when Mrs. Norris
ceased speaking, it was altogether a silent drive to those within.
Their spirits were in general exhausted; and to determine whether the
day had afforded most pleasure or pain, might occupy the meditations of
almost all.
