<p/>The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases and again
during the chief of the day was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen
to Mr. Collins. Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">"It keeps him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) in good humour,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "and I am more obliged
to you than I can express." Charlotte assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
satisfaction in being useful, and that it amply repaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) for
the little sacrifice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) time. This was very amiable, but
Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth had any
conception of; its object was nothing else than to secure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them
towards herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances
were so favourable, that when they parted at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) would
have felt almost secure of success if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had not been to leave
Hertfordshire so very soon. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) did injustice to the
fire and independence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) character, for it led him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to escape
out of Longbourn House the next morning with admirable slyness,
and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw himself at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) feet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was
anxious to avoid the notice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) cousins, from a conviction
that if they saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) depart, they could not fail to conjecture
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) design, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was not willing to have the attempt known till
its success might be known likewise; for though feeling almost
secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably
encouraging, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was comparatively diffident since the adventure
of Wednesday. His (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) reception, however, was of the most flattering
kind. Miss Lucas perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) from an upper window as he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) walked
towards the house, and instantly set out to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) accidentally
in the lane. But little had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) dared to hope that so much love
and eloquence awaited her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) there.

<p/>In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,
everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both;
and as they entered the house he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) earnestly entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) to name
the day that was to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the happiest of men; and though such
a solicitation must be waived for the present, the lady felt no
inclination to trifle with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happiness. The stupidity with
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was favoured by nature must guard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) courtship from any
charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance; and Miss
Lucas, who accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) solely from the pure and disinterested
desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that establishment
were gained.

<p/>Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their
consent; and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr.
Collins’s present circumstances made it a most eligible match for
their daughter, to whom they could give little fortune; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas
began directly to calculate, with more interest than the matter
had ever excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was
likely to live; and Sir William gave it as his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) decided opinion,
that whenever Mr. Collins should be in possession of the
Longbourn estate, it would be highly expedient that both he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife should make their appearance at St. James’s. The whole
family, in short, were properly overjoyed on the occasion. The
younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two sooner
than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved
from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid.
Charlotte herself was tolerably composed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
point, and had time to consider of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) reflections were in
general satisfactory. Mr. Collins, to be sure, was neither
sensible nor agreeable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) society was irksome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) must be imaginary. But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would be her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
husband. Without thinking highly either of men or matrimony,
marriage had always been her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) object; it was the only provision
for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however
uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest
preservative from want. This preservative she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had now obtained;
and at the age of twenty-seven, without having ever been
handsome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) felt all the good luck of it. The least agreeable
circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to
Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) valued beyond that of any
other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and probably would blame
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolution was not to be shaken, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings
must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolved to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
the information herself, and therefore charged Mr. Collins, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had
passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of
course very dutifully given, but it could not be kept without
difficulty; for the curiosity excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) long absence burst
forth in such very direct questions on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return as required
some ingenuity to evade, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was at the same time exercising
great self-denial, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was longing to publish his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) prosperous
love.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) journey too early on the morrow to see any
of the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when
the ladies moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great
politeness and cordiality, said how happy they should be to see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) at Longbourn again, whenever his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) engagements might allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
to visit them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">"this invitation is particularly
gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and
you may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon
as possible."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means
wish for so speedy a return, immediately said:

<p/>"But is there not danger of Lady Catherine’s disapprobation here,
my good sir? You had better neglect your relations than run the
risk of offending your patroness."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Collins, "I am particularly obliged to
you for this friendly caution, and you may depend upon my not
taking so material a step without her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship’s concurrence."

<p/>"You cannot be too much upon your guard. Risk anything rather
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) displeasure; and if you find it likely to be raised by
your coming to us again, which I should think exceedingly
probable, stay quietly at home, and be satisfied that _we_ shall
take no offence."

<p/>"Believe me, my dear sir, my gratitude is warmly excited by such
affectionate attention; and depend upon it, you will speedily
receive from me a letter of thanks for this, and for every other
mark of your regard during my stay in Hertfordshire. As for my
fair cousins, though my absence may not be long enough to render
it necessary, I shall now take the liberty of wishing them health
and happiness, not excepting my cousin Elizabeth."

<p/>With proper civilities the ladies then withdrew; all of them
equally surprised that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) meditated a quick return. Mrs. Bennet
wished to understand by it that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) thought of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)
addresses to one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) younger girls, and Mary might have been
prevailed on to accept him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) rated his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) abilities much higher
than any of the others; there was a solidity in his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) reflections
which often struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and though by no means so clever as
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) thought that if encouraged to read and improve
himself by such an example as hers, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might become a very
agreeable companion. But on the following morning, every hope of
this kind was done away. Miss Lucas called soon after breakfast,
and in a private conference with Elizabeth related the event of
the day before.

<p/>The possibility of Mr. Collins’s fancying himself in love with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend had once occurred to Elizabeth within the last day or
two; but that Charlotte could encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) seemed almost as far
from possibility as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) herself, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first
the bounds of decorum, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not help crying out:

<p/>"Engaged to Mr. Collins! My dear Charlotte—impossible!"

<p/>The steady countenance which Miss Lucas had commanded in telling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) story, gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so
direct a reproach; though, as it was no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) expected,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) soon regained her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) composure, and calmly replied:

<p/>"Why should you be surprised, my dear Eliza? Do you think it
incredible that Mr. Collins should be able to procure any woman’s
good opinion, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was not so happy as to succeed with
you?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But Elizabeth had now recollected herself, and making a strong
effort for it, was able to assure with tolerable firmness that
the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all imaginable happiness.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I see what you are feeling," replied Charlotte. "You must be
surprised, very much surprised—so lately as Mr. Collins was
wishing to marry you. But when you have had time to think it
over, I hope you will be satisfied with what I have done. I am
not romantic, you know; I never was. I ask only a comfortable
home; and considering Mr. Collins’s character, connection, and
situation in life, I am convinced that my chance of happiness
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) is as fair as most people can boast on entering the
marriage state."

<p/>Elizabeth quietly answered <div class="bookquote">"Undoubtedly;"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>and after an awkward
pause, they returned to the rest of the family. Charlotte did not
stay much longer, and Elizabeth was then left to reflect on what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard. It was a long time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) became at all
reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match. The strangeness
of Mr. Collins’s making two offers of marriage within three days
was nothing in comparison of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) being now accepted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
always felt that Charlotte’s opinion of matrimony was not exactly
like her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had not supposed it to be possible that,
when called into action, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would have sacrificed every better
feeling to worldly advantage. Charlotte the wife of Mr. Collins
was a most humiliating picture! And to the pang of a friend
disgracing herself and sunk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) esteem, was added the
distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to
be tolerably happy in the lot she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had chosen.
