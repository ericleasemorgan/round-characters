<p/>As the Miss Dashwoods entered the drawing-room of the park the next
day, at one door, Mrs. Palmer came running in at the other, looking as
good humoured and merry as before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) took them all most
affectionately by the hand, and expressed great delight in seeing them
again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am so glad to see you!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), seating herself between Elinor and
Marianne, "for it is so bad a day I was afraid you might not come,
which would be a shocking thing, as we go away again tomorrow. We must
go, for the Westons come to us next week you know. It was quite a
sudden thing our coming at all, and I knew nothing of it till the
carriage was coming to the door, and then Mr. Palmer asked me if I
would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to Barton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) is so droll! He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) never tells me any
thing! I am so sorry we cannot stay longer; however we shall meet again
in town very soon, I hope.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They were obliged to put an end to such an expectation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Not go to town!" cried Mrs. Palmer, with a laugh, "I shall be quite
disappointed if you do not. I could get the nicest house in the world
for you, next door to ours, in Hanover-square. You must come, indeed. I
am sure I shall be very happy to chaperon you at any time till I am
confined, if Mrs. Dashwood should not like to go into public.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); but were obliged to resist all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) entreaties.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>Oh, my love," cried Mrs. Palmer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband, who just then entered
the room—"you must help me to persuade the Miss Dashwoods to go to town
this winter.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) love made no answer; and after slightly bowing to the ladies, began
complaining of the weather.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How horrid all this is!" said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). "Such weather makes every thing and
every body disgusting. Dullness is as much produced within doors as
without, by rain. It makes one detest all one’s acquaintance. What the
devil does Sir John mean by not having a billiard room in his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) house?
How few people know what comfort is! Sir John is as stupid as the
weather.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The rest of the company soon dropt in.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am afraid, Miss Marianne," said Sir John, "you have not been able to
take your usual walk to Allenham today.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne looked very grave and said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>Oh, don’t be so sly before us," said Mrs. Palmer; "for we know all
about it, I assure you; and I admire your taste very much, for I think
he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is extremely handsome. We do not live a great way from him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) in the
country, you know. Not above ten miles, I dare say."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Much nearer thirty,"  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband.

<p/>"Ah, well! there is not much difference. I never was at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) house; but
they say it is a sweet pretty place."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As vile a spot as I ever saw in my life,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Palmer</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Palmer.

<p/>Marianne remained perfectly silent, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) countenance betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
interest in what was said.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is it very ugly?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Palmer—<div class="bookquote">"then it must be some other
place that is so pretty I suppose."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div><p/>When they were seated in the dining room, Sir John observed with regret
that they were only eight all together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) lady, "it is very provoking that we should be
so few. Why did not you ask the Gilberts to come to us today?"

<p/>"Did not I tell you, Sir John, when you spoke to me about it before,
that it could not be done? They dined with us last."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You and I, Sir John,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, "should not stand upon such
ceremony."

<p/>"Then you would be very ill-bred,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Palmer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>My love you contradict every body," said his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) usual
laugh. "Do you know that you are quite rude?"

<p/>"I did not know I contradicted any body in calling your mother
ill-bred."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ay, you may abuse me as you please,"  (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>said the good-natured old lady,
"you have taken Charlotte off my hands, and cannot give her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) back again.
So there I have the whip hand of you."

<p/>Charlotte laughed heartily to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband could not get rid
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>); and exultingly said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not care how cross he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>),
as they must live together. It was impossible for any one to be more
thoroughly good-natured, or more determined to be happy than Mrs.
Palmer. The studied indifference, insolence, and discontent of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
husband gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) no pain; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) scolded or abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was
highly diverted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr. Palmer is so droll!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), in a whisper, to Elinor. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is
always out of humour."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor was not inclined, after a little observation, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) credit
for being so genuinely and unaffectedly ill-natured or ill-bred as he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
wished to appear. His (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) temper might perhaps be a little soured by
finding, like many others of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex, that through some unaccountable
bias in favour of beauty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was the husband of a very silly woman—but
she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew that this kind of blunder was too common for any sensible man
to be lastingly hurt by it. It was rather a wish of distinction, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
believed, which produced his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) contemptuous treatment of every body, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) general abuse of every thing before him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It was the desire of
appearing superior to other people. The motive was too common to be
wondered at; but the means, however they might succeed by establishing
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) superiority in ill-breeding, were not likely to attach any one to
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) except his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, my dear Miss Dashwood,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Palmer soon afterwards, <div class="bookquote">"I have
got such a favour to ask of you and your sister. Will you come and
spend some time at Cleveland this Christmas? Now, pray do,—and come
while the Westons are with us. You cannot think how happy I shall be!
It will be quite delightful!—My love,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>applying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) husband, "don’t
you long to have the Miss Dashwoods come to Cleveland?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied, with a sneer—"I came into Devonshire with no
other view."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There now," (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>—said his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lady, "you see Mr. Palmer expects you; so you
cannot refuse to come.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They both eagerly and resolutely declined her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) invitation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>But indeed you must and shall come. I am sure you will like it of all
things. The Westons will be with us, and it will be quite delightful.
You cannot think what a sweet place Cleveland is; and we are so gay
now, for Mr. Palmer is always going about the country canvassing
against the election; and so many people came to dine with us that I
never saw before, it is quite charming! But, poor fellow! it is very
fatiguing to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is forced to make every body like him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assented to the
hardship of such an obligation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>How charming it will be," said Charlotte, "when he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is in
Parliament!—won’t it? How I shall laugh! It will be so ridiculous to
see all his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) letters directed to him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) with an M.P.—But do you know, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)
says, he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) will never frank for me? He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) declares he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) won’t. Don’t you, Mr.
Palmer?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Palmer took no notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) cannot bear writing, you know," she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) continued—"he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) says it is quite
shocking."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), "I never said any thing so irrational. Don’t palm all
your abuses of language upon me."

<p/>"There now; you see how droll he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is. This is always the way with him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)!
Sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) won’t speak to me for half a day together, and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
comes out with something so droll—all about any thing in the world.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) surprised Elinor very much as they returned into the drawing-room,
by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did not like Mr. Palmer excessively.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>Certainly," said Elinor; "he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) seems very agreeable."

<p/>"Well—I am so glad you do. I thought you would, he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is so pleasant; and
Mr. Palmer is excessively pleased with you and your sisters I can tell
you, and you can’t think how disappointed he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) will be if you don’t come
to Cleveland.—I can’t imagine why you should object to it."

<p/>Elinor was again obliged to decline her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) invitation; and by changing the
subject, put a stop to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) entreaties. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought it probable that as
they lived in the same county, Mrs. Palmer might be able to give some
more particular account of Willoughby’s general character, than could
be gathered from the Middletons’ partial acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
was eager to gain from any one, such a confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) merits as
might remove the possibility of fear from Marianne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) began by
inquiring if they saw much of Mr. Willoughby at Cleveland, and whether
they were intimately acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh dear, yes; I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) extremely well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Palmer</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Palmer;—"Not
that I ever spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), indeed; but I have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) for ever in town.
Somehow or other I never happened to be staying at Barton while he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) was
at Allenham. Mama saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) here once before;—but I was with my uncle at
Weymouth. However, I dare say we should have seen a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
in Somersetshire, if it had not happened very unluckily that we should
never have been in the country together. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is very little at Combe, I
believe; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) were ever so much there, I do not think Mr. Palmer
would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), for he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) is in the opposition, you know, and besides it
is such a way off. I know why you inquire about him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>), very well; your
sister is to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>). I am monstrous glad of it, for then I shall
have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for a neighbour you know."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "you know much more of the matter than
I do, if you have any reason to expect such a match."

<p/>"Don’t pretend to deny it, because you know it is what every body talks
of. I assure you I heard of it in my way through town."

<p/>"My dear Mrs. Palmer!"

<p/>"Upon my honour I did.—I met Colonel Brandon Monday morning in
Bond-street, just before we left town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) told me of it directly."

<p/>"You surprise me very much. Colonel Brandon tell you of it! Surely you
must be mistaken. To give such intelligence to a person who could not
be interested in it, even if it were true, is not what I should expect
Colonel Brandon to do."

<p/>"But I do assure you it was so, for all that, and I will tell you how
it happened. When we met him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) turned back and walked with us; and so
we began talking of my brother and sister, and one thing and another,
and I said to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘So, Colonel, there is a new family come to Barton
cottage, I hear, and mama sends me word they are very pretty, and that
one of them is going to be married to Mr. Willoughby of Combe Magna. Is
it true, pray? for of course you must know, as you have been in
Devonshire so lately.’ (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>"And what did the Colonel say?"

<p/>"Oh—he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) did not say much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knew it to be true, so
from that moment I set it down as certain. It will be quite delightful,
I declare! When is it to take place?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Brandon was very well I hope?"

<p/>"Oh! yes, quite well; and so full of your praises, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) did nothing but
say fine things of you."

<p/>"I am flattered by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) commendation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) seems an excellent man; and I
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) uncommonly pleasing."

<p/>"So do I. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is such a charming man, that it is quite a pity he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should
be so grave and so dull. Mama says _he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)_ was in love with your sister
too. I assure you it was a great compliment if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) hardly
ever falls in love with any body."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is Mr. Willoughby much known in your part of Somersetshire?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/>"Oh! yes, extremely well; that is, I do not believe many people are
acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), because Combe Magna is so far off; but they all
think him (<font color='blue'><b>Magna</b></font>) extremely agreeable I assure you. Nobody is more liked than
Mr. Willoughby wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) goes, and so you may tell your sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
is a monstrous lucky girl to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), upon my honour; not but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
is much more lucky in getting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), because she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is so very handsome and
agreeable, that nothing can be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). However, I don’t
think her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hardly at all handsomer than you, I assure you; for I think
you both excessively pretty, and so does Mr. Palmer too I am sure,
though we could not get him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to own it last night.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Palmer’s information respecting Willoughby was not very material;
but any testimony in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) favour, however small, was pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am so glad we are got acquainted at last," continued Charlotte.—"And
now I hope we shall always be great friends. You can’t think how much I
longed to see you! It is so delightful that you should live at the
cottage! Nothing can be like it, to be sure! And I am so glad your
sister is going to be well married! I hope you will be a great deal at
Combe Magna. It is a sweet place, by all accounts."

<p/>"You have been long acquainted with Colonel Brandon, have not you?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, a great while; ever since my sister married. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was a particular
friend of Sir John’s. I believe,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) added in a low voice, "he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would
have been very glad to have had me, if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) could. Sir John and Lady
Middleton wished it very much. But mama did not think the match good
enough for me, otherwise Sir John would have mentioned it to the
Colonel, and we should have been married immediately."

<p/>"Did not Colonel Brandon know of Sir John’s proposal to your mother
before it was made? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) never owned his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) affection to yourself?"

<p/>"Oh, no; but if mama had not objected to it, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would have
liked it of all things. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not seen me then above twice, for it was
before I left school. However, I am much happier as I am. Mr. Palmer is
the kind of man I like."
