<p/>Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the
vestibule to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw
Elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) towards the
staircase, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated
both him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their
nearer connection. Mr. Collins received and returned these
felicitations with equal pleasure, and then proceeded to relate
the particulars of their interview, with the result of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
trusted he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had every reason to be satisfied, since the refusal
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin had steadfastly given him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would naturally flow
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
character.

<p/>This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would have
been glad to be equally satisfied that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter had meant to
encourage him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) by protesting against his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) proposals, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dared
not believe it, and could not help saying so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But, depend upon it, Mr. Collins,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, "that Lizzy shall
be brought to reason. I will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) about it directly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
is a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) own
interest but I will _make_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) know it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Collins; "but
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my
situation, who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage
state. If therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) actually persists in rejecting my suit,
perhaps it were better not to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) into accepting me,
because if liable to such defects of temper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) could not
contribute much to my felicity."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Sir, you quite misunderstand me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed.
"Lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything
else she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) is as good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go
directly to Mr. Bennet, and we shall very soon settle it with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>), I am sure.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) time to reply, but hurrying instantly to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) husband, called out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) entered the library, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>Oh! Mr.
Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar. You
must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) vows she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) will
not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and if you do not make haste he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) will change his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
mind and not have _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Bennet raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) book as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) entered, and
fixed them on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) face with a calm unconcern which was not in the
least altered by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) communication.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have not the pleasure of understanding you," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) speech. "Of what are you talking?"

<p/>"Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) will not have Mr.
Collins, and Mr. Collins begins to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) will not have
Lizzy."

<p/>"And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems an hopeless
business."

<p/>"Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) that you insist upon
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)."

<p/>"Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) be called down. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) shall hear my opinion.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the
library.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>child</b></font>)</div>Come here, child," cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) appeared. "I have
sent for you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr.
Collins has made you an offer of marriage. Is it true?<div class="bookquote">" Elizabeth
replied that it was. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Very well—and this offer of marriage you
have refused?"

<p/>"I have, sir."

<p/>"Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon
your accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?"

<p/>"Yes, or I will never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) again."

<p/>"An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day
you must be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will
never see you again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will
never see you again if you _do_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a
beginning, but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
husband regarded the affair as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wished, was excessively
disappointed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, in talking this way? You promised
me to _insist_ upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) marrying him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband, "I have two small favours to
request. First, that you will allow me the free use of my
understanding on the present occasion; and secondly, of my room.
I shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be."

<p/>Not yet, however, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) disappointment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband,
did Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) talked to Elizabeth again
and again; coaxed and threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) by turns. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured to
secure Jane in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) interest; but Jane, with all possible
mildness, declined interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with
real earnestness, and sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attacks. Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner varied, however, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) determination
never did.

<p/>Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had
passed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought too well of himself to comprehend on what
motives his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin could refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) pride was
hurt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) suffered in no other way. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was quite
imaginary; and the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) deserving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s
reproach prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) feeling any regret.

<p/>While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to
spend the day with them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was met in the vestibule by Lydia,
who, flying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), cried in a half whisper, "I am glad you are
come, for there is such fun here! What do you think has happened
this morning? Mr. Collins has made an offer to Lizzy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
will not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Charlotte hardly had time to answer, before they were joined by
Kitty, who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they
entered the breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
likewise began on the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
compassion, and entreating her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend Lizzy to
comply with the wishes of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) family. " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>Pray do, my dear Miss
Lucas," she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) added in a melancholy tone, "for nobody is on my
side, nobody takes part with me. I am cruelly used, nobody feels
for my poor nerves.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and
Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Aye, there she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) comes,<div class="bookquote">" continued Mrs. Bennet, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>looking as
unconcerned as may be, and caring no more for us than if we were
at York, provided she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) can have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own way. But I tell you, Miss
Lizzy—if you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer
of marriage in this way, you will never get a husband at all—and
I am sure I do not know who is to maintain you when your father
is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep you—and so I warn you. I
have done with you from this very day. I told you in the library,
you know, that I should never speak to you again, and you will
find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking to
undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in
talking to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous
complaints can have no great inclination for talking. Nobody can
tell what I suffer! But it is always so. Those who do not
complain are never pitied.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that
any attempt to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) or soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would only increase
the irritation. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) talked on, therefore, without interruption
from any of them, till they were joined by Mr. Collins, who
entered the room with an air more stately than usual, and on
perceiving whom, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said to the girls, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Now, I do insist upon
it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and let me and Mr.
Collins have a little conversation together."

<p/>Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty
followed, but Lydia stood her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ground, determined to hear all she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
could; and Charlotte, detained first by the civility of Mr.
Collins, whose enquiries after herself and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) family were
very minute, and then by a little curiosity, satisfied herself
with walking to the window and pretending not to hear. In a
doleful voice Mrs. Bennet began the projected conversation: "Oh!
Mr. Collins!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"let us be for ever silent on this
point. Far be it from me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) presently continued, in a voice
that marked his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) displeasure, "to resent the behaviour of your
daughter. Resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all;
the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as I
have been in early preferment; and I trust I am resigned. Perhaps
not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had
my fair cousin honoured me with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hand; for I have often
observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the
blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our
estimation. You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any
disrespect to your family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my
pretensions to your daughter’s favour, without having paid
yourself and Mr. Bennet the compliment of requesting you to
interpose your authority in my behalf. My conduct may, I fear, be
objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your
daughter’s lips instead of your own. But we are all liable to
error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair. My
object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with
due consideration for the advantage of all your family, and if my
_manner_ has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to
apologise."
