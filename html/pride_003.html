<p/>Not all that Mrs. Bennet, however, with the assistance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
five daughters, could ask on the subject, was sufficient to draw
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband any satisfactory description of Mr. Bingley.
They attacked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) in various ways—with barefaced questions,
ingenious suppositions, and distant surmises; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eluded the
skill of them all, and they were at last obliged to accept the
second-hand intelligence of their neighbour, Lady Lucas. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
report was highly favourable. Sir William had been delighted with
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was quite young, wonderfully handsome, extremely
agreeable, and, to crown the whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) meant to be at the next
assembly with a large party. Nothing could be more delightful! To
be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love;
and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley’s heart were entertained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I can but see one of my daughters happily settled at
Netherfield,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband, "and all the
others equally well married, I shall have nothing to wish for."

<p/>In a few days Mr. Bingley returned Mr. Bennet’s visit, and sat
about ten minutes with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) library. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had entertained
hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies, of whose
beauty he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had heard much; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) saw only the father. The ladies
were somewhat more fortunate, for they had the advantage of
ascertaining from an upper window that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wore a blue coat, and
rode a black horse.

<p/>An invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched; and
already had Mrs. Bennet planned the courses that were to do
credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) housekeeping, when an answer arrived which deferred
it all. Mr. Bingley was obliged to be in town the following day,
and, consequently, unable to accept the honour of their
invitation, etc.. Mrs. Bennet was quite disconcerted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could
not imagine what business he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could have in town so soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
arrival in Hertfordshire; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began to fear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might be
always flying about from one place to another, and never settled
at Netherfield as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) ought to be. Lady Lucas quieted her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) fears a
little by starting the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being gone to London only to
get a large party for the ball; and a report soon followed that
Mr. Bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to the assembly. The girls grieved over such a number of
ladies, but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing,
that instead of twelve he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brought only six with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from
London—his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) five sisters and a cousin. And when the party entered
the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether—Mr.
Bingley, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) two sisters, the husband of the eldest, and another
young man.

<p/>Mr. Bingley was good-looking and gentlemanlike; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had a pleasant
countenance, and easy, unaffected manners. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were fine
women, with an air of decided fashion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother-in-law, Mr.
Hurst, merely looked the gentleman; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) friend Mr. Darcy soon
drew the attention of the room by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fine, tall person, handsome
features, noble mien, and the report which was in general
circulation within five minutes after his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entrance, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having
ten thousand a year. The gentlemen pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be a fine
figure of a man, the ladies declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was much handsomer than
Mr. Bingley, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was looked at with great admiration for about
half the evening, till his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners gave a disgust which turned
the tide of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) popularity; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was discovered to be proud; to
be above his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) company, and above being pleased; and not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
large estate in Derbyshire could then save him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) from having a most
forbidding, disagreeable countenance, and being unworthy to be
compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Mr. Bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the
principal people in the room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was lively and unreserved,
danced every dance, was angry that the ball closed so early, and
talked of giving one himself at Netherfield. Such amiable
qualities must speak for themselves. What a contrast between him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend! Mr. Darcy danced only once with Mrs. Hurst and
once with Miss Bingley, declined being introduced to any other
lady, and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the
room, speaking occasionally to one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own party. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
character was decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was the proudest, most disagreeable man
in the world, and everybody hoped that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would never come there
again. Amongst the most violent against him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was Mrs. Bennet,
whose dislike of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) general behaviour was sharpened into
particular resentment by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having slighted one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
daughters.

<p/>Elizabeth Bennet had been obliged, by the scarcity of gentlemen,
to sit down for two dances; and during part of that time, Mr.
Darcy had been standing near enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to hear a
conversation between him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) and Mr. Bingley, who came from the dance
for a few minutes, to press his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend to join it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Come, Darcy,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), "I must have you dance. I hate to see you
standing about by yourself in this stupid manner. You had much
better dance."

<p/>"I certainly shall not. You know how I detest it, unless I am
particularly acquainted with my partner. At such an assembly as
this it would be insupportable. Your sisters are engaged, and
there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a
punishment to me to stand up with."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would not be so fastidious as you are,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Bingley,
"for a kingdom! Upon my honour, I never met with so many pleasant
girls in my life as I have this evening; and there are several of
them you see uncommonly pretty."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_You_ are dancing with the only handsome girl in the room,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said
Mr. Darcy, looking at the eldest Miss Bennet.

<p/>"Oh! She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is the most beautiful creature I ever beheld! But there
is one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sisters sitting down just behind you, who is very
pretty, and I dare say very agreeable. Do let me ask my partner
to introduce you."

<p/>"Which do you mean?" and turning round he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked for a moment at
Elizabeth, till catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eye, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) withdrew his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own and coldly
said: "She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt _me_; I
am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies
who are slighted by other men. You had better return to your
partner and enjoy her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) smiles, for you are wasting your time with
me."

<p/>Mr. Bingley followed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) advice. Mr. Darcy walked off; and
Elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings toward him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
told the story, however, with great spirit among her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friends; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a lively, playful disposition, which delighted in
anything ridiculous.

<p/>The evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family.
Mrs. Bennet had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eldest daughter much admired by the
Netherfield party. Mr. Bingley had danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) twice, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
had been distinguished by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters. Jane was as much gratified
by this as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother could be, though in a quieter way.
Elizabeth felt Jane’s pleasure. Mary had heard herself mentioned
to Miss Bingley as the most accomplished girl in the
neighbourhood; and Catherine and Lydia had been fortunate enough
never to be without partners, which was all that they had yet
learnt to care for at a ball. They returned, therefore, in good
spirits to Longbourn, the village where they lived, and of which
they were the principal inhabitants. They found Mr. Bennet still
up. With a book he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was regardless of time; and on the present
occasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an
evening which had raised such splendid expectations. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had
rather hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife’s views on the stranger would be
disappointed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) soon found out that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had a different story
to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, my dear Mr. Bennet,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) entered the room, "we have had a
most delightful evening, a most excellent ball. I wish you had
been there. Jane was so admired, nothing could be like it.
Everybody said how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) looked; and Mr. Bingley thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
quite beautiful, and danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) twice! Only think of _that_,
my dear; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) actually danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) twice! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was the only
creature in the room that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) asked a second time. First of all,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) asked Miss Lucas. I was so vexed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) stand up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)!
But, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did not admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) at all; indeed, nobody can,
you know; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) seemed quite struck with Jane as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was going
down the dance. So he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) enquired who she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was, and got introduced,
and asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for the two next. Then the two third he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) danced with
Miss King, and the two fourth with Maria Lucas, and the two fifth
with Jane again, and the two sixth with Lizzy, and the
_Boulanger_—"

<p/>"If he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) had had any compassion for _me_,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) husband
impatiently, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) would not have danced half so much! For God’s
sake, say no more of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) partners. Oh that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) had sprained his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
ankle in the first dance!"

<p/>"Oh! my dear, I am quite delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) is so excessively
handsome! And his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sisters are charming women. I never in my life
saw anything more elegant than their dresses. I dare say the lace
upon Mrs. Hurst’s gown—"

<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was interrupted again. Mr. Bennet protested against any
description of finery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was therefore obliged to seek another
branch of the subject, and related, with much bitterness of
spirit and some exaggeration, the shocking rudeness of Mr. Darcy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But I can assure you,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) added, "that Lizzy does not lose much
by not suiting _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ fancy; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a most disagreeable, horrid
man, not at all worth pleasing. So high and so conceited that
there was no enduring him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)! He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked here, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked there,
fancying himself so very great! Not handsome enough to dance
with! I wish you had been there, my dear, to have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) one
of your set-downs. I quite detest the man."
