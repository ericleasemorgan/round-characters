<p/>The novelty of travelling, and the happiness of being with William,
soon produced their natural effect on Fanny’s spirits, when Mansfield
Park was fairly left behind; and by the time their first stage was
ended, and they were to quit Sir Thomas’s carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was able to
take leave of the old coachman, and send back proper messages, with
cheerful looks.

<p/>Of pleasant talk between the brother and sister there was no end.
Everything supplied an amusement to the high glee of William’s mind,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was full of frolic and joke in the intervals of their
higher-toned subjects, all of which ended, if they did not begin, in
praise of the Thrush, conjectures how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be employed, schemes
for an action with some superior force, which (supposing the first
lieutenant out of the way, and William was not very merciful to the
first lieutenant) was to give himself the next step as soon as
possible, or speculations upon prize-money, which was to be generously
distributed at home, with only the reservation of enough to make the
little cottage comfortable, in which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and Fanny were to pass all
their middle and later life together.

<p/>Fanny’s immediate concerns, as far as they involved Mr. Crawford, made
no part of their conversation. William knew what had passed, and from
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) heart lamented that his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister’s feelings should be so cold towards
a man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must consider as the first of human characters; but he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was of an age to be all for love, and therefore unable to blame; and
knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wish on the subject, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would not distress her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) by the
slightest allusion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had reason to suppose herself not yet forgotten by Mr. Crawford.
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had heard repeatedly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister within the three weeks which
had passed since their leaving Mansfield, and in each letter there had
been a few lines from himself, warm and determined like his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) speeches.
It was a correspondence which Fanny found quite as unpleasant as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had feared. Miss Crawford’s style of writing, lively and affectionate,
was itself an evil, independent of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was thus forced into
reading from the brother’s pen, for Edmund would never rest till she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had read the chief of the letter to him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>); and then she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had to listen to
his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) language, and the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attachments.
There had, in fact, been so much of message, of allusion, of
recollection, so much of Mansfield in every letter, that Fanny could
not but suppose it meant for him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) to hear; and to find herself forced
into a purpose of that kind, compelled into a correspondence which was
bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the addresses of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not love, and obliging
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to administer to the adverse passion of the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did, was
cruelly mortifying. Here, too, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present removal promised advantage.
When no longer under the same roof with Edmund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted that Miss
Crawford would have no motive for writing strong enough to overcome the
trouble, and that at Portsmouth their correspondence would dwindle into
nothing.

<p/>With such thoughts as these, among ten hundred others, Fanny proceeded
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey safely and cheerfully, and as expeditiously as could
rationally be hoped in the dirty month of February. They entered
Oxford, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could take only a hasty glimpse of Edmund’s college as
they passed along, and made no stop anywhere till they reached Newbury,
where a comfortable meal, uniting dinner and supper, wound up the
enjoyments and fatigues of the day.

<p/>The next morning saw them off again at an early hour; and with no
events, and no delays, they regularly advanced, and were in the
environs of Portsmouth while there was yet daylight for Fanny to look
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and wonder at the new buildings. They passed the
drawbridge, and entered the town; and the light was only beginning to
fail as, guided by William’s powerful voice, they were rattled into a
narrow street, leading from the High Street, and drawn up before the
door of a small house now inhabited by Mr. Price.

<p/>Fanny was all agitation and flutter; all hope and apprehension. The
moment they stopped, a trollopy-looking maidservant, seemingly in
waiting for them at the door, stepped forward, and more intent on
telling the news than giving them any help, immediately began with,
"The Thrush is gone out of harbour, please sir, and one of the officers
has been here to—" She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was interrupted by a fine tall boy of eleven
years old, who, rushing out of the house, pushed the maid aside, and
while William was opening the chaise-door himself, called out, "You are
just in time. We have been looking for you this half-hour. The Thrush
went out of harbour this morning. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>). It was a beautiful sight.
And they think she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) orders in a day or two. And Mr.
Campbell was here at four o’clock to ask for you: he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) has got one of the
Thrush’s boats, and is going off to her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) at six, and hoped you would be
here in time to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>)."

<p/>A stare or two at Fanny, as William helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) out of the carriage, was
all the voluntary notice which this brother bestowed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made no
objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) kissing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), though still entirely engaged in
detailing farther particulars of the Thrush’s going out of harbour, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) had a strong right of interest, being to commence his (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) career
of seamanship in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at this very time.

<p/>Another moment and Fanny was in the narrow entrance-passage of the
house, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother’s arms, who met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) there with looks of true
kindness, and with features which Fanny loved the more, because they
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram’s before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and there were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two sisters:
Susan, a well-grown fine girl of fourteen, and Betsey, the youngest of
the family, about five—both glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) in their way, though with
no advantage of manner in receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>). But manner Fanny did not want.
Would they but love her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should be satisfied.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was then taken into a parlour, so small that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first conviction
was of its being only a passage-room to something better, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stood
for a moment expecting to be invited on; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw there was no
other door, and that there were signs of habitation before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
called back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts, reproved herself, and grieved lest they
should have been suspected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, however, could not stay long
enough to suspect anything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was gone again to the street-door, to
welcome William. "Oh! my dear William, how glad I am to see you. But
have you heard about the Thrush? She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is gone out of harbour already;
three days before we had any thought of it; and I do not know what I am
to do about Sam’s things, they will never be ready in time; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may
have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) orders to-morrow, perhaps. It takes me quite unawares. And now
you must be off for Spithead too. Campbell has been here, quite in a
worry about you; and now what shall we do? I thought to have had such a
comfortable evening with you, and here everything comes upon me at
once.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) son answered cheerfully, telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that everything was always for
the best; and making light of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) own inconvenience in being obliged to
hurry away so soon.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>To be sure, I had much rather she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had stayed in harbour, that I might
have sat a few hours with you in comfort; but as there is a boat
ashore, I had better go off at once, and there is no help for it.
Whereabouts does the Thrush lay at Spithead? Near the Canopus? But no
matter; here’s Fanny in the parlour, and why should we stay in the
passage? Come, mother, you have hardly looked at your own dear Fanny
yet.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>In they both came, and Mrs. Price having kindly kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter
again, and commented a little on her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) growth, began with very natural
solicitude to feel for their fatigues and wants as travellers.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Poor dears! how tired you must both be! and now, what will you have? I
began to think you would never come. Betsey and I have been watching
for you this half-hour. And when did you get anything to eat? And what
would you like to have now? I could not tell whether you would be for
some meat, or only a dish of tea, after your journey, or else I would
have got something ready. And now I am afraid Campbell will be here
before there is time to dress a steak, and we have no butcher at hand.
It is very inconvenient to have no butcher in the street. We were
better off in our last house. Perhaps you would like some tea as soon
as it can be got.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They both declared they should prefer it to anything. " (<font color='red'><b>Betsey</b></font>)</div>Then, Betsey, my
dear, run into the kitchen and see if Rebecca has put the water on; and
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to bring in the tea-things as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) can. I wish we could
get the bell mended; but Betsey is a very handy little messenger.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Betsey went with alacrity, proud to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) abilities before her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) fine
new sister.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Dear me!<div class="bookquote">" continued the anxious mother, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>what a sad fire we have got,
and I dare say you are both starved with cold. Draw your chair nearer,
my dear. I cannot think what Rebecca has been about. I am sure I told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) to bring some coals half an hour ago. Susan, you should have taken
care of the fire."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I was upstairs, mama, moving my things,"  (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>said Susan, in a fearless,
self-defending tone, which startled Fanny. "You know you had but just
settled that my sister Fanny and I should have the other room; and I
could not get Rebecca to give me any help."

<p/>Farther discussion was prevented by various bustles: first, the driver
came to be paid; then there was a squabble between Sam and Rebecca
about the manner of carrying up his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) sister’s trunk, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would
manage all his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own way; and lastly, in walked Mr. Price himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
own loud voice preceding him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), as with something of the oath kind he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
kicked away his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son’s portmanteau and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter’s bandbox in the
passage, and called out for a candle; no candle was brought, however,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) walked into the room.

<p/>Fanny with doubting feelings had risen to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), but sank down again
on finding herself undistinguished in the dusk, and unthought of. With
a friendly shake of his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son’s hand, and an eager voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) instantly
began—"Ha! welcome back, my boy. Glad to see you. Have you heard the
news? The Thrush went out of harbour this morning. Sharp is the word,
you see! By G—, you are just in time! The doctor has been here
inquiring for you: he (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>) has got one of the boats, and is to be off for
Spithead by six, so you had better go with him (<font color='blue'><b>doctor</b></font>). I have been to Turner’s
about your mess; it is all in a way to be done. I should not wonder if
you had your orders to-morrow: but you cannot sail with this wind, if
you are to cruise to the westward; and Captain Walsh thinks you will
certainly have a cruise to the westward, with the Elephant. By G—, I
wish you may! But old Scholey was saying, just now, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walsh</b></font>) thought you
would be sent first to the Texel. Well, well, we are ready, whatever
happens. But by G—, you lost a fine sight by not being here in the
morning to see the Thrush go out of harbour! I would not have been out
of the way for a thousand pounds. Old Scholey ran in at breakfast-time,
to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) had slipped her (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) moorings and was coming out, I jumped up,
and made but two steps to the platform. If ever there was a perfect
beauty afloat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) is one; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) lays at Spithead, and anybody
in England would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) for an eight-and-twenty. I was upon the
platform two hours this afternoon looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) lays close to the
Endymion, between her (<font color='blue'><b>Scholey</b></font>) and the Cleopatra, just to the eastward of the
sheer hulk."

<p/>"Ha!" cried William, "_that’s_ just where I should have put her (<font color='blue'><b>Cleopatra</b></font>) myself.
It’s the best berth at Spithead. But here is my sister, sir; here is
Fanny," turning and leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) forward; "it is so dark you do not see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>With an acknowledgment that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had quite forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), Mr. Price now
received his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter; and having given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) a cordial hug, and observed
that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was grown into a woman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) supposed would be wanting a
husband soon, seemed very much inclined to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) again. Fanny
shrunk back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat, with feelings sadly pained by his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) language and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) smell of spirits; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) talked on only to his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son, and only of the
Thrush, though William, warmly interested as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in that subject,
more than once tried to make his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father think of Fanny, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) long
absence and long journey.

<p/>After sitting some time longer, a candle was obtained; but as there was
still no appearance of tea, nor, from Betsey’s reports from the
kitchen, much hope of any under a considerable period, William
determined to go and change his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dress, and make the necessary
preparations for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) removal on board directly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might have his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
tea in comfort afterwards.

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left the room, two rosy-faced boys, ragged and dirty, about eight
and nine years old, rushed into it just released from school, and
coming eagerly to see their sister, and tell that the Thrush was gone
out of harbour; Tom and Charles. Charles had been born since Fanny’s
going away, but Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had often helped to nurse, and now felt a
particular pleasure in seeing again. Both were kissed very tenderly,
but Tom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted to keep by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), to try to trace the features of the
baby she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had loved, and talked to, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) infant preference of herself.
Tom, however, had no mind for such treatment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) came home not to stand
and be talked to, but to run about and make a noise; and both boys had
soon burst from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and slammed the parlour-door till her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) temples
ached.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now seen all that were at home; there remained only two
brothers between herself and Susan, one of whom was a clerk in a public
office in London, and the other midshipman on board an Indiaman. But
though she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had _seen_ all the members of the family, she (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) had not yet
_heard_ all the noise they could make. Another quarter of an hour
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>clerk</b></font>) a great deal more. William was soon calling out from the
landing-place of the second story for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother and for Rebecca. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
was in distress for something that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had left there, and did not find
again. A key was mislaid, Betsey accused of having got at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) new hat,
and some slight, but essential alteration of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uniform waistcoat,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had been promised to have done for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), entirely neglected.

<p/>Mrs. Price, Rebecca, and Betsey all went up to defend themselves, all
talking together, but Rebecca loudest, and the job was to be done as
well as it could in a great hurry; William trying in vain to send
Betsey down again, or keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) from being troublesome where she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was;
the whole of which, as almost every door in the house was open, could
be plainly distinguished in the parlour, except when drowned at
intervals by the superior noise of Sam, Tom, and Charles chasing each
other up and down stairs, and tumbling about and hallooing.

<p/>Fanny was almost stunned. The smallness of the house and thinness of
the walls brought everything so close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that, added to the
fatigue of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) journey, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recent agitation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hardly knew
how to bear it. _Within_ the room all was tranquil enough, for Susan
having disappeared with the others, there were soon only her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father and
herself remaining; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), taking out a newspaper, the accustomary loan
of a neighbour, applied himself to studying it, without seeming to
recollect her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) existence. The solitary candle was held between himself
and the paper, without any reference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) possible convenience; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had nothing to do, and was glad to have the light screened from her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
aching head, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sat in bewildered, broken, sorrowful contemplation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was at home. But, alas! it was not such a home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had not such a
welcome, as—she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) checked herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was unreasonable. What right had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to be of importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) family? She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could have none, so long
lost sight of! William’s concerns must be dearest, they always had
been, and he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had every right. Yet to have so little said or asked about
herself, to have scarcely an inquiry made after Mansfield! It did pain
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) to have Mansfield forgotten; the friends who had done so much—the
dear, dear friends! But here, one subject swallowed up all the rest.
Perhaps it must be so. The destination of the Thrush must be now
preeminently interesting. A day or two might shew the difference. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)_
only was to blame. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) thought it would not have been so at
Mansfield. No, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uncle’s house there would have been a
consideration of times and seasons, a regulation of subject, a
propriety, an attention towards everybody which there was not here.

<p/>The only interruption which thoughts like these received for nearly
half an hour was from a sudden burst of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father’s, not at all
calculated to compose them. At a more than ordinary pitch of thumping
and hallooing in the passage, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) exclaimed, "Devil take those young
dogs! How they are singing out! Ay, Sam’s voice louder than all the
rest! That boy is fit for a boatswain. Holla, you there! Sam, stop your
confounded pipe, or I shall be after you."

<p/>This threat was so palpably disregarded, that though within five
minutes afterwards the three boys all burst into the room together and
sat down, Fanny could not consider it as a proof of anything more than
their being for the time thoroughly fagged, which their hot faces and
panting breaths seemed to prove, especially as they were still kicking
each other’s shins, and hallooing out at sudden starts immediately
under their father’s eye.

<p/>The next opening of the door brought something more welcome: it was for
the tea-things, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had begun almost to despair of seeing that
evening. Susan and an attendant girl, whose inferior appearance
informed Fanny, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great surprise, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had previously seen the
upper servant, brought in everything necessary for the meal; Susan
looking, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) put the kettle on the fire and glanced at her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sister,
as if divided between the agreeable triumph of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) activity and
usefulness, and the dread of being thought to demean herself by such an
office. <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had been into the kitchen,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) said, "to hurry Sally and
help make the toast, and spread the bread and butter, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) did not
know when they should have got tea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) sister must
want something after her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) journey."

<p/>Fanny was very thankful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could not but own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) should be very
glad of a little tea, and Susan immediately set about making it, as if
pleased to have the employment all to herself; and with only a little
unnecessary bustle, and some few injudicious attempts at keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
brothers in better order than she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could, acquitted herself very well.
Fanny’s spirit was as much refreshed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) body; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head and heart
were soon the better for such well-timed kindness. Susan had an open,
sensible countenance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was like William, and Fanny hoped to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
like him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in disposition and goodwill towards herself.

<p/>In this more placid state of things William reentered, followed not far
behind by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mother and Betsey. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), complete in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) lieutenant’s
uniform, looking and moving all the taller, firmer, and more graceful
for it, and with the happiest smile over his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) face, walked up directly
to Fanny, who, rising from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) for a moment in
speechless admiration, and then threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arms round his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) neck to sob
out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) various emotions of pain and pleasure.

<p/>Anxious not to appear unhappy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon recovered herself; and wiping
away her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears, was able to notice and admire all the striking parts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) dress; listening with reviving spirits to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) cheerful hopes of
being on shore some part of every day before they sailed, and even of
getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to Spithead to see the sloop.

<p/>The next bustle brought in Mr. Campbell, the surgeon of the Thrush, a
very well-behaved young man, who came to call for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, and for
whom there was with some contrivance found a chair, and with some hasty
washing of the young tea-maker’s, a cup and saucer; and after another
quarter of an hour of earnest talk between the gentlemen, noise rising
upon noise, and bustle upon bustle, men and boys at last all in motion
together, the moment came for setting off; everything was ready,
William took leave, and all of them were gone; for the three boys, in
spite of their mother’s entreaty, determined to see their brother and
Mr. Campbell to the sally-port; and Mr. Price walked off at the same
time to carry back his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) neighbour’s newspaper.

<p/>Something like tranquillity might now be hoped for; and accordingly,
when Rebecca had been prevailed on to carry away the tea-things, and
Mrs. Price had walked about the room some time looking for a
shirt-sleeve, which Betsey at last hunted out from a drawer in the
kitchen, the small party of females were pretty well composed, and the
mother having lamented again over the impossibility of getting Sam
ready in time, was at leisure to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eldest daughter and the
friends she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had come from.

<p/>A few inquiries began: but one of the earliest—<div class="bookquote">"How did sister Bertram
manage about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) servants?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"Was she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as much plagued as herself to get
tolerable servants?" (<font color='red'><b>Northamptonshire</b></font>)</div>—soon led her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mind away from Northamptonshire, and
fixed it on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own domestic grievances, and the shocking character of
all the Portsmouth servants, of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own two were the
very worst, engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) completely. The Bertrams were all forgotten
in detailing the faults of Rebecca, against whom Susan had also much to
depose, and little Betsey a great deal more, and who did seem so
thoroughly without a single recommendation, that Fanny could not help
modestly presuming that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother meant to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) year
was up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) year!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Price; "I am sure I hope I shall be rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) has staid a year, for that will not be up till November.
Servants are come to such a pass, my dear, in Portsmouth, that it is
quite a miracle if one keeps them more than half a year. I have no hope
of ever being settled; and if I was to part with Rebecca, I should only
get something worse. And yet I do not think I am a very difficult
mistress to please; and I am sure the place is easy enough, for there
is always a girl under her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), and I often do half the work myself."

<p/>Fanny was silent; but not from being convinced that there might not be
a remedy found for some of these evils. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now sat looking at
Betsey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) could not but think particularly of another sister, a very
pretty little girl, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had left there not much younger when she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
went into Northamptonshire, who had died a few years afterwards. There
had been something remarkably amiable about her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Fanny in those early
days had preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to Susan; and when the news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) death had at
last reached Mansfield, had for a short time been quite afflicted. The
sight of Betsey brought the image of little Mary back again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
would not have pained her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother by alluding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for the world.
While considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) with these ideas, Betsey, at a small distance,
was holding out something to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) eyes, meaning to screen it at
the same time from Susan’s.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What have you got there, my love?"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny; <div class="bookquote">"come and shew it to
me."

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>It was a silver knife. Up jumped Susan, claiming it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own, and
trying to get it away; but the child ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother’s protection,
and Susan could only reproach, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) did very warmly, and evidently
hoping to interest Fanny on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side. "It was very hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
not to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _own_ knife; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own knife; little sister Mary
had left it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) deathbed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought to have had it to
keep herself long ago. But mama kept it from her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), and was always
letting Betsey get hold of it; and the end of it would be that Betsey
would spoil it, and get it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) own, though mama had _promised_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
that Betsey should not have it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) own hands."

<p/>Fanny was quite shocked. Every feeling of duty, honour, and tenderness
was wounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister’s speech and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother’s reply.

<p/>"Now, Susan,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Price, in a complaining voice, " (<font color='red'><b>Susan</b></font>)</div>now, how can
you be so cross? You are always quarrelling about that knife. I wish
you would not be so quarrelsome. Poor little Betsey; how cross Susan is
to you! But you should not have taken it out, my dear, when I sent you
to the drawer. You know I told you not to touch it, because Susan is so
cross about it. I must hide it another time, Betsey. Poor Mary little
thought it would be such a bone of contention when she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) gave it me to
keep, only two hours before she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) died. Poor little soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) could but
just speak to be heard, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) said so prettily, <div class="bookquote">‘Let sister Susan
have my knife, mama, when I am dead and buried.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Poor little dear! she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
was so fond of it, Fanny, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have it lay by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in bed, all
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) illness. It was the gift of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) good godmother, old Mrs.
Admiral Maxwell, only six weeks before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was taken for death. Poor
little sweet creature! Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was taken away from evil to come. My
own Betsey" (fondling her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)), "_you_ have not the luck of such a good
godmother. Aunt Norris lives too far off to think of such little people
as you."

<p/>Fanny had indeed nothing to convey from aunt Norris, but a message to
say she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) god-daughter was a good girl, and learnt her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
book. There had been at one moment a slight murmur in the drawing-room
at Mansfield Park about sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a prayer-book; but no second sound
had been heard of such a purpose. Mrs. Norris, however, had gone home
and taken down two old prayer-books of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) husband with that idea; but,
upon examination, the ardour of generosity went off. One was found to
have too small a print for a child’s eyes, and the other to be too
cumbersome for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to carry about.

<p/>Fanny, fatigued and fatigued again, was thankful to accept the first
invitation of going to bed; and before Betsey had finished her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) cry at
being allowed to sit up only one hour extraordinary in honour of
sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was off, leaving all below in confusion and noise again;
the boys begging for toasted cheese, her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) father calling out for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) rum
and water, and Rebecca never where she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) ought to be.

<p/>There was nothing to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) spirits in the confined and scantily
furnished chamber that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) was to share with Susan. The smallness of
the rooms above and below, indeed, and the narrowness of the passage
and staircase, struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) soon learned to
think with respect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) own little attic at Mansfield Park, in _that_
house reckoned too small for anybody’s comfort.
