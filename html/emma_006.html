<p/>Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) young vanity to a very good purpose, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admiration by agreeable hints, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no scruple with regard to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) talked of Harriet, and praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so warmly, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) growing attachment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have given Miss Smith all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) required,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); "you have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) graceful and easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was a beautiful creature when she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) came to you, but, in my opinion, the attractions you have added are infinitely superior to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) received from nature."

<p/>"I am glad you think I have been useful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); but Harriet only wanted drawing out, and receiving a few, very few hints. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had all the natural grace of sweetness of temper and artlessness in herself. I have done very little."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If it were admissible to contradict a lady,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>said the gallant Mr. Elton

<p/>"I have perhaps given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little more decision of character, have taught her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to think on points which had not fallen in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) way before."

<p/>"Exactly so; that is what principally strikes me. So much superadded decision of character! Skilful has been the hand!"

<p/>"Great has been the pleasure, I am sure. I never met with a disposition more truly amiable."

<p/>"I have no doubt of it." And it was spoken with a sort of sighing animation, which had a vast deal of the lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not less pleased another day with the manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) seconded a sudden wish of hers, to have Harriet's picture.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did you ever have your likeness taken, Harriet?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>): <div class="bookquote">"did you ever sit for your picture?"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet was on the point of leaving the room, and only stopt to say, with a very interesting na vet ,

<p/>"Oh! dear, no, never."

<p/>No sooner was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) out of sight, than Emma exclaimed,

<p/>"What an exquisite possession a good picture of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would be! I would give any money for it. I almost long to attempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) likeness myself. You do not know it I dare say, but two or three years ago I had a great passion for taking likenesses, and attempted several of my friends, and was thought to have a tolerable eye in general. But from one cause or another, I gave it up in disgust. But really, I could almost venture, if Harriet would sit to me. It would be such a delight to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) picture!"

<p/>"Let me entreat you," cried Mr. Elton; "it would indeed be a delight! Let me entreat you, Miss Woodhouse, to exercise so charming a talent in favour of your friend. I know what your drawings are. How could you suppose me ignorant? Is not this room rich in specimens of your landscapes and flowers; and has not Mrs. Weston some inimitable figure-pieces in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) drawing-room, at Randalls?"

<p/>Yes, good man! thought Emma but what has all that to do with taking likenesses? You know nothing of drawing. Don't pretend to be in raptures about mine. Keep your raptures for Harriet's face. "Well, if you give me such kind encouragement, Mr. Elton, I believe I shall try what I can do. Harriet's features are very delicate, which makes a likeness difficult; and yet there is a peculiarity in the shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth which one ought to catch."

<p/>"Exactly so The shape of the eye and the lines about the mouth I have not a doubt of your success. Pray, pray attempt it. As you will do it, it will indeed, to use your own words, be an exquisite possession."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But I am afraid, Mr. Elton, Harriet will not like to sit. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thinks so little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty. Did not you observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) manner of answering me? How completely it meant, ' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>why should my picture be drawn?'"

<p/>"Oh! yes, I observed it, I assure you. It was not lost on me. But still I cannot imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not be persuaded."

<p/>Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) many beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would ever submit to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) played and sang; and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) approached the degree of excellence which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not much deceived as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.

<p/>There was merit in every drawing in the least finished, perhaps the most; her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) style was spirited; but had there been much less, or had there been ten times more, the delight and admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) two companions would have been the same. They were both in ecstasies. A likeness pleases every body; and Miss Woodhouse's performances must be capital.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No great variety of faces for you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">"I had only my own family to study from. There is my father another of my father but the idea of sitting for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) picture made him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) so nervous, that I could only take him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would sit whenever I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). There is my sister; and really quite her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own little elegant figure! and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would have sat longer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in such a hurry to have me draw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) four children that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children; there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bella</b></font>) was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cockade as you would wish to see. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had nestled down his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) head most conveniently. That's very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,"  (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length "my last and my best my brother, Mr. John Knightley. This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it (Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like) only too handsome too flattering but that was a fault on the right side" after all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of "Yes, it was a little like but to be sure it did not do him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) justice. We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square; and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my resolution now."

<p/>Mr. Elton seemed very properly struck and delighted by the idea, and was repeating, <div class="bookquote">"No husbands and wives in the case at present indeed, as you observe. Exactly so. No husbands and wives,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>with so interesting a consciousness, that Emma began to consider whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not better leave them together at once. But as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be drawing, the declaration must wait a little longer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had soon fixed on the size and sort of portrait. It was to be a whole-length in water-colours, like Mr. John Knightley's, and was destined, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could please herself, to hold a very honourable station over the mantelpiece.

<p/>The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and watching every touch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) credit for stationing himself where he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to place himself elsewhere. It then occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to employ him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in reading.

<p/>"If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would be so good as to read to them, it would be a kindness indeed! It would amuse away the difficulties of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) part, and lessen the irksomeness of Miss Smith's."

<p/>Mr. Elton was only too happy. Harriet listened, and Emma drew in peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be still frequently coming to look; any thing less would certainly have been too little in a lover; and he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) was ready at the smallest intermission of the pencil, to jump up and see the progress, and be charmed. There was no being displeased with such an encourager, for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) admiration made him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) discern a likeness almost before it was possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not respect his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) eye, but his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) love and his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) complaisance were unexceptionable.

<p/>The sitting was altogether very satisfactory; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite enough pleased with the first day's sketch to wish to go on. There was no want of likeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been fortunate in the attitude, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to throw in a little improvement to the figure, to give a little more height, and considerably more elegance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had great confidence of its being in every way a pretty drawing at last, and of its filling its destined place with credit to them both a standing memorial of the beauty of one, the skill of the other, and the friendship of both; with as many other agreeable associations as Mr. Elton's very promising attachment was likely to add.

<p/>Harriet was to sit again the next day; and Mr. Elton, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ought, entreated for the permission of attending and reading to them again.

<p/>"By all means. We shall be most happy to consider you as one of the party."

<p/>The same civilities and courtesies, the same success and satisfaction, took place on the morrow, and accompanied the whole progress of the picture, which was rapid and happy. Every body who saw it was pleased, but Mr. Elton was in continual raptures, and defended it through every criticism.

<p/>"Miss Woodhouse has given her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friend the only beauty she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wanted," observed Mrs. Weston to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not in the least suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was addressing a lover. "The expression of the eye is most correct, but Miss Smith has not those eyebrows and eyelashes. It is the fault of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has them not."

<p/>"Do you think so?<div class="bookquote">" replied he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot agree with you. It appears to me a most perfect resemblance in every feature. I never saw such a likeness in my life. We must allow for the effect of shade, you know."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) too tall, Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/Mr. Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley.

<p/>Emma knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added,

<p/>"Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is sitting down which naturally presents a different which in short gives exactly the idea and the proportions must be preserved, you know. Proportions, fore-shortening. Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is very pretty,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse. "So prettily done! Just as your drawings always are, my dear. I do not know any body who draws so well as you do. The only thing I do not thoroughly like is, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems to be sitting out of doors, with only a little shawl over her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) shoulders and it makes one think she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must catch cold."

<p/>"But, my dear papa, it is supposed to be summer; a warm day in summer. Look at the tree."

<p/>"But it is never safe to sit out of doors, my dear."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You, sir, may say any thing,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Elton, "but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character. The na vet  of Miss Smith's manners and altogether Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness."

<p/>The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) stirring out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) house in the fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) gallantry was always on the alert. "Might he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) have in executing it! he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should be gratified by being employed on such an errand."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was too good! she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not endure the thought! she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) such a troublesome office for the world,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>brought on the desired repetition of entreaties and assurances, and a very few minutes settled the business.

<p/>Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and Emma thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What a precious deposit!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with a tender sigh, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) received it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This man is almost too gallant to be in love,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>thought Emma. "I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it will be an <div class="bookquote">'Exactly so,'  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) says himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) gratitude on Harriet's account."
