<p/>Elinor’s curiosity to see Mrs. Ferrars was satisfied. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had found in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) every thing that could tend to make a farther connection between
the families undesirable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had seen enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) pride, her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
meanness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) determined prejudice against herself, to comprehend
all the difficulties that must have perplexed the engagement, and
retarded the marriage, of Edward and herself, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) been otherwise
free; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had seen almost enough to be thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) _own_ sake,
that one greater obstacle preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from suffering under any other
of Mrs. Ferrars’s creation, preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from all dependence upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
caprice, or any solicitude for her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) good opinion. Or at least, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
did not bring herself quite to rejoice in Edward’s being fettered to
Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) determined, that had Lucy been more amiable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) _ought_ to
have rejoiced.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wondered that Lucy’s spirits could be so very much elevated by the
civility of Mrs. Ferrars;—that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) interest and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) vanity should so
very much blind her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) as to make the attention which seemed only paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
because she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was _not Elinor_, appear a compliment to herself—or to
allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to derive encouragement from a preference only given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>),
because her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) real situation was unknown. But that it was so, had not
only been declared by Lucy’s eyes at the time, but was declared over
again the next morning more openly, for at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particular desire, Lady
Middleton set her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) down in Berkeley Street on the chance of seeing
Elinor alone, to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/>The chance proved a lucky one, for a message from Mrs. Palmer soon
after she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) arrived, carried Mrs. Jennings away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, as soon as they were by themselves, "I
come to talk to you of my happiness. Could anything be so flattering as
Mrs. Ferrars’s way of treating me yesterday? So exceeding affable as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was! You know how I dreaded the thoughts of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but the
very moment I was introduced, there was such an affability in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
behaviour as really should seem to say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had quite took a fancy to
me. Now was not it so? You saw it all; and was not you quite struck
with it?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was certainly very civil to you."

<p/>"Civil!—Did you see nothing but only civility?—I saw a vast deal more.
Such kindness as fell to the share of nobody but me!—No pride, no
hauteur, and your sister just the same—all sweetness and affability!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor wished to talk of something else, but Lucy still pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to
own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had reason for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) happiness; and Elinor was obliged to go
on.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Undoubtedly, if they had known your engagement," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"nothing
could be more flattering than their treatment of you;—but as that was
not the case—"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I guessed you would say so," (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—replied Lucy quickly—"but there was no
reason in the world why Mrs. Ferrars should seem to like me, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) did
not, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) liking me is every thing. You shan’t talk me out of my
satisfaction. I am sure it will all end well, and there will be no
difficulties at all, to what I used to think. Mrs. Ferrars is a
charming woman, and so is your sister. They are both delightful women,
indeed!—I wonder I should never hear you say how agreeable Mrs.
Dashwood was!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>To this Elinor had no answer to make, and did not attempt any.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dashwood</b></font>)</div>Are you ill, Miss Dashwood?—you seem low—you don’t speak;—sure you
an’t well."

<p/>"I never was in better health."

<p/>"I am glad of it with all my heart; but really you did not look it. I
should be sorry to have _you_ ill; you, that have been the greatest
comfort to me in the world!—Heaven knows what I should have done
without your friendship."

<p/>Elinor tried to make a civil answer, though doubting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own success.
But it seemed to satisfy Lucy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) directly replied,

<p/>"Indeed I am perfectly convinced of your regard for me, and next to
Edward’s love, it is the greatest comfort I have. Poor Edward! But now
there is one good thing, we shall be able to meet, and meet pretty
often, for Lady Middleton’s delighted with Mrs. Dashwood, so we shall
be a good deal in Harley Street, I dare say, and Edward spends half his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
time with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister—besides, Lady Middleton and Mrs. Ferrars will
visit now;—and Mrs. Ferrars and your sister were both so good to say
more than once, they should always be glad to see me. They are such
charming women!—I am sure if ever you tell your sister what I think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), you cannot speak too high."

<p/>But Elinor would not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) any encouragement to hope that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
_should_ tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. Lucy continued.

<p/>"I am sure I should have seen it in a moment, if Mrs. Ferrars had took
a dislike to me. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had only made me a formal courtesy, for
instance, without saying a word, and never after had took any notice of
me, and never looked at me in a pleasant way—you know what I mean—if I
had been treated in that forbidding sort of way, I should have gave it
all up in despair. I could not have stood it. For where she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) _does_
dislike, I know it is most violent."

<p/>Elinor was prevented from making any reply to this civil triumph, by
the door’s being thrown open, the servant’s announcing Mr. Ferrars, and
Edward’s immediately walking in.

<p/>It was a very awkward moment; and the countenance of each showed that
it was so. They all looked exceedingly foolish; and Edward seemed to
have as great an inclination to walk out of the room again, as to
advance farther into it. The very circumstance, in its unpleasantest
form, which they would each have been most anxious to avoid, had fallen
on them.—They were not only all three together, but were together
without the relief of any other person. The ladies recovered themselves
first. It was not Lucy’s business to put herself forward, and the
appearance of secrecy must still be kept up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could therefore only
_look_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) tenderness, and after slightly addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), said no more.

<p/>But Elinor had more to do; and so anxious was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sake and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
own, to do it well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself, after a moment’s
recollection, to welcome him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), with a look and manner that were almost
easy, and almost open; and another struggle, another effort still
improved them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow the presence of Lucy, nor the
consciousness of some injustice towards herself, to deter her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) from
saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was happy to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had very much
regretted being from home, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) called before in Berkeley Street.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would not be frightened from paying him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) those attentions which, as
a friend and almost a relation, were his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) due, by the observant eyes of
Lucy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon perceived them to be narrowly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) manners gave some re-assurance to Edward, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had courage enough
to sit down; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) embarrassment still exceeded that of the ladies in
a proportion, which the case rendered reasonable, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sex might
make it rare; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart had not the indifference of Lucy’s, nor
could his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) conscience have quite the ease of Elinor’s.

<p/>Lucy, with a demure and settled air, seemed determined to make no
contribution to the comfort of the others, and would not say a word;
and almost every thing that _was_ said, proceeded from Elinor, who was
obliged to volunteer all the information about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s health,
their coming to town, &c. which Edward ought to have inquired about,
but never did.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exertions did not stop here; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon afterwards felt herself
so heroically disposed as to determine, under pretence of fetching
Marianne, to leave the others by themselves; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) really did it, and
_that_ in the handsomest manner, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) loitered away several minutes
on the landing-place, with the most high-minded fortitude, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister. When that was once done, however, it was time for
the raptures of Edward to cease; for Marianne’s joy hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into
the drawing-room immediately. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pleasure in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was like every
other of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings, strong in itself, and strongly spoken. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) with a hand that would be taken, and a voice that expressed the
affection of a sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear Edward!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried, "this is a moment of great happiness!—This
would almost make amends for every thing!"

<p/>Edward tried to return her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) kindness as it deserved, but before such
witnesses he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dared not say half what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really felt. Again they all sat
down, and for a moment or two all were silent; while Marianne was
looking with the most speaking tenderness, sometimes at Edward and
sometimes at Elinor, regretting only that their delight in each other
should be checked by Lucy’s unwelcome presence. Edward was the first to
speak, and it was to notice Marianne’s altered looks, and express his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not finding London agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, don’t think of me!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied with spirited earnestness, though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke, "don’t think of _my_
health. Elinor is well, you see. That must be enough for us both.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This remark was not calculated to make Edward or Elinor more easy, nor
to conciliate the good will of Lucy, who looked up at Marianne with no
very benignant expression.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Do you like London?" said Edward, willing to say any thing that might
introduce another subject.

<p/>"Not at all. I expected much pleasure in it, but I have found none. The
sight of you, Edward, is the only comfort it has afforded; and thank
Heaven! you are what you always were!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) paused—no one spoke.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I think, Elinor," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presently added, "we must employ Edward to take
care of us in our return to Barton. In a week or two, I suppose, we
shall be going; and, I trust, Edward will not be very unwilling to
accept the charge."

<p/>Poor Edward muttered something, but what it was, nobody knew, not even
himself. But Marianne, who saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) agitation, and could easily trace it
to whatever cause best pleased herself, was perfectly satisfied, and
soon talked of something else.

<p/>"We spent such a day, Edward, in Harley Street yesterday! So dull, so
wretchedly dull!—But I have much to say to you on that head, which
cannot be said now.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And with this admirable discretion did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) defer the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
finding their mutual relatives more disagreeable than ever, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
being particularly disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother, till they were more in
private.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>But why were you not there, Edward?—Why did you not come?"

<p/>"I was engaged elsewhere."

<p/>"Engaged! But what was that, when such friends were to be met?"

<p/>"Perhaps, Miss Marianne," cried Lucy, eager to take some revenge on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), "you think young men never stand upon engagements, if they have no
mind to keep them, little as well as great."

<p/>Elinor was very angry, but Marianne seemed entirely insensible of the
sting; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmly replied,

<p/>"Not so, indeed; for, seriously speaking, I am very sure that
conscience only kept Edward from Harley Street. And I really believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
_has_ the most delicate conscience in the world; the most scrupulous in
performing every engagement, however minute, and however it may make
against his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) interest or pleasure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is the most fearful of giving
pain, of wounding expectation, and the most incapable of being selfish,
of any body I ever saw. Edward, it is so, and I will say it. What! are
you never to hear yourself praised!—Then you must be no friend of mine;
for those who will accept of my love and esteem, must submit to my open
commendation.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) commendation, in the present case, however, happened
to be particularly ill-suited to the feelings of two thirds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
auditors, and was so very unexhilarating to Edward, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) very soon
got up to go away.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Going so soon!" said Marianne; "my dear Edward, this must not be."

<p/>And drawing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) a little aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) persuasion that Lucy
could not stay much longer. But even this encouragement failed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
would go; and Lucy, who would have outstaid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) visit lasted
two hours, soon afterwards went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What can bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) here so often?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) leaving them.
"Could not she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) see that we wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gone!—how teazing to Edward!"

<p/>"Why so?—we were all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) friends, and Lucy has been the longest known
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) of any. It is but natural that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should like to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as well
as ourselves."

<p/>Marianne looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) steadily, and said, "You know, Elinor, that this
is a kind of talking which I cannot bear. If you only hope to have your
assertion contradicted, as I must suppose to be the case, you ought to
recollect that I am the last person in the world to do it. I cannot
descend to be tricked out of assurances, that are not really wanted."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then left the room; and Elinor dared not follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to say more,
for bound as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) promise of secrecy to Lucy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could give
no information that would convince Marianne; and painful as the
consequences of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still continuing in an error might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
obliged to submit to it. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could hope, was that Edward would
not often expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) or himself to the distress of hearing Marianne’s
mistaken warmth, nor to the repetition of any other part of the pain
that had attended their recent meeting—and this she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had every reason to
expect.
