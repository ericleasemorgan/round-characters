<p/>The conference was neither so short nor so conclusive as the lady had
designed. The gentleman was not so easily satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had all the
disposition to persevere that Sir Thomas could wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had vanity,
which strongly inclined him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the first place to think she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did love
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), though she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) might not know it herself; and which, secondly, when
constrained at last to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) did know her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own present
feelings, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should be able in time to make those
feelings what he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wished.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was in love, very much in love; and it was a love which, operating
on an active, sanguine spirit, of more warmth than delicacy, made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
affection appear of greater consequence because it was withheld, and
determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to have the glory, as well as the felicity, of forcing
her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not despair: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not desist. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had every well-grounded
reason for solid attachment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to have all the worth that
could justify the warmest hopes of lasting happiness with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
conduct at this very time, by speaking the disinterestedness and
delicacy of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) character (qualities which he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) believed most rare
indeed), was of a sort to heighten all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wishes, and confirm all his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
resolutions. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) knew not that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had a pre-engaged heart to attack. Of
_that_ he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had no suspicion. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) rather as one who had
never thought on the subject enough to be in danger; who had been
guarded by youth, a youth of mind as lovely as of person; whose modesty
had prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) from understanding his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) attentions, and who was still
overpowered by the suddenness of addresses so wholly unexpected, and
the novelty of a situation which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fancy had never taken into
account.

<p/>Must it not follow of course, that, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was understood, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) should
succeed? He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) believed it fully. Love such as his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), in a man like himself,
must with perseverance secure a return, and at no great distance; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had so much delight in the idea of obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to love him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) in a
very short time, that her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) not loving him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) now was scarcely regretted. A
little difficulty to be overcome was no evil to Henry Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
rather derived spirits from it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been apt to gain hearts too
easily. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) situation was new and animating.

<p/>To Fanny, however, who had known too much opposition all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life to
find any charm in it, all this was unintelligible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
did mean to persevere; but how he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could, after such language from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt herself obliged to use, was not to be understood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) told
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), could not love him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never
should love him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); that such a change was quite impossible; that the
subject was most painful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never to
mention it again, to allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at once, and let it be
considered as concluded for ever. And when farther pressed, had added,
that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opinion their dispositions were so totally dissimilar as to
make mutual affection incompatible; and that they were unfitted for
each other by nature, education, and habit. All this she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had said, and
with the earnestness of sincerity; yet this was not enough, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
immediately denied there being anything uncongenial in their
characters, or anything unfriendly in their situations; and positively
declared, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would still love, and still hope!

<p/>Fanny knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own meaning, but was no judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own manner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
manner was incurably gentle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not aware how much it
concealed the sternness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) purpose. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) diffidence, gratitude, and
softness made every expression of indifference seem almost an effort of
self-denial; seem, at least, to be giving nearly as much pain to
herself as to him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>). Mr. Crawford was no longer the Mr. Crawford who, as
the clandestine, insidious, treacherous admirer of Maria Bertram, had
been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) abhorrence, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had hated to see or to speak to, in whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could believe no good quality to exist, and whose power, even of
being agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had barely acknowledged. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was now the Mr.
Crawford who was addressing herself with ardent, disinterested love;
whose feelings were apparently become all that was honourable and
upright, whose views of happiness were all fixed on a marriage of
attachment; who was pouring out his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) merits, describing and
describing again his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection, proving as far as words could prove it,
and in the language, tone, and spirit of a man of talent too, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) gentleness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) goodness; and to complete the
whole, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was now the Mr. Crawford who had procured William’s
promotion!

<p/>Here was a change, and here were claims which could not but operate!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might have disdained him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in all the dignity of angry virtue, in the
grounds of Sotherton, or the theatre at Mansfield Park; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) now with rights that demanded different treatment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
must be courteous, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) must be compassionate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) must have a
sensation of being honoured, and whether thinking of herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) must have a strong feeling of gratitude. The effect of the
whole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper
of vanity and hope like Crawford’s, the truth, or at least the strength
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) indifference, might well be questionable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not so
irrational as Fanny considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), in the professions of persevering,
assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.

<p/>It was with reluctance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) suffered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to go; but there was no
look of despair in parting to belie his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) words, or give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
being less unreasonable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) professed himself.

<p/>Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was angry. Some resentment did arise at a perseverance so
selfish and ungenerous. Here was again a want of delicacy and regard
for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Here was
again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so reprobated
before. How evidently was there a gross want of feeling and humanity
where his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own pleasure was concerned—And, alas! how always known no
principle to supply as a duty what the heart was deficient in. Had her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
own affections been as free—as perhaps they ought to have been—he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never
could have engaged them.

<p/>So thought Fanny, in good truth and sober sadness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat musing
over that too great indulgence and luxury of a fire upstairs: wondering
at the past and present; wondering at what was yet to come, and in a
nervous agitation which made nothing clear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) but the persuasion of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being never under any circumstances able to love Mr. Crawford, and
the felicity of having a fire to sit over and think of it.

<p/>Sir Thomas was obliged, or obliged himself, to wait till the morrow for
a knowledge of what had passed between the young people. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) then saw
Mr. Crawford, and received his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) account. The first feeling was
disappointment: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had hoped better things; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had thought that an
hour’s entreaty from a young man like Crawford could not have worked so
little change on a gentle-tempered girl like Fanny; but there was
speedy comfort in the determined views and sanguine perseverance of the
lover; and when seeing such confidence of success in the principal, Sir
Thomas was soon able to depend on it himself.

<p/>Nothing was omitted, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) side, of civility, compliment, or kindness,
that might assist the plan. Mr. Crawford’s steadiness was honoured, and
Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in
the world. At Mansfield Park Mr. Crawford would always be welcome; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had only to consult his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own judgment and feelings as to the frequency
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) visits, at present or in future. In all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece’s family and
friends, there could be but one opinion, one wish on the subject; the
influence of all who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) must incline one way.

<p/>Everything was said that could encourage, every encouragement received
with grateful joy, and the gentlemen parted the best of friends.

<p/>Satisfied that the cause was now on a footing the most proper and
hopeful, Sir Thomas resolved to abstain from all farther importunity
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and to shew no open interference. Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) disposition
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) believed kindness might be the best way of working. Entreaty should
be from one quarter only. The forbearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) family on a point,
respecting which she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could be in no doubt of their wishes, might be
their surest means of forwarding it. Accordingly, on this principle,
Sir Thomas took the first opportunity of saying to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), with a mild
gravity, intended to be overcoming, "Well, Fanny, I have seen Mr.
Crawford again, and learn from him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exactly how matters stand between
you. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is a most extraordinary young man, and whatever be the event,
you must feel that you have created an attachment of no common
character; though, young as you are, and little acquainted with the
transient, varying, unsteady nature of love, as it generally exists,
you cannot be struck as I am with all that is wonderful in a
perseverance of this sort against discouragement. With him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) it is
entirely a matter of feeling: he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) claims no merit in it; perhaps is
entitled to none. Yet, having chosen so well, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) constancy has a
respectable stamp. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) choice been less unexceptionable, I should
have condemned his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) persevering."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, <div class="bookquote">"I am very sorry that Mr. Crawford should
continue to—I know that it is paying me a very great compliment, and I
feel most undeservedly honoured; but I am so perfectly convinced, and I
have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so, that it never will be in my power—"

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>interrupted Sir Thomas, "there is no occasion for this. Your
feelings are as well known to me as my wishes and regrets must be to
you. There is nothing more to be said or done. From this hour the
subject is never to be revived between us. You will have nothing to
fear, or to be agitated about. You cannot suppose me capable of trying
to persuade you to marry against your inclinations. Your happiness and
advantage are all that I have in view, and nothing is required of you
but to bear with Mr. Crawford’s endeavours to convince you that they
may not be incompatible with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) proceeds at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own risk. You are
on safe ground. I have engaged for your seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) calls,
as you might have done had nothing of this sort occurred. You will see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with the rest of us, in the same manner, and, as much as you can,
dismissing the recollection of everything unpleasant. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) leaves
Northamptonshire so soon, that even this slight sacrifice cannot be
often demanded. The future must be very uncertain. And now, my dear
Fanny, this subject is closed between us."

<p/>The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much
satisfaction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s kind expressions, however, and forbearing
manner, were sensibly felt; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) considered how much of the
truth was unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no right to wonder at
the line of conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pursued. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), who had married a daughter to Mr.
Rushworth: romantic delicacy was certainly not to be expected from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) must do her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duty, and trust that time might make her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) duty easier
than it now was.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not, though only eighteen, suppose Mr. Crawford’s attachment
would hold out for ever; she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could not but imagine that steady,
unceasing discouragement from herself would put an end to it in time.
How much time she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) might, in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own fancy, allot for its dominion, is
another concern. It would not be fair to inquire into a young lady’s
exact estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own perfections.

<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intended silence, Sir Thomas found himself once more
obliged to mention the subject to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) briefly for
its being imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunts; a measure which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would still have
avoided, if possible, but which became necessary from the totally
opposite feelings of Mr. Crawford as to any secrecy of proceeding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had no idea of concealment. It was all known at the Parsonage, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
loved to talk over the future with both his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters, and it would be
rather gratifying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to have enlightened witnesses of the progress
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) success. When Sir Thomas understood this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) felt the necessity
of making his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own wife and sister-in-law acquainted with the business
without delay; though, on Fanny’s account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) almost dreaded the effect
of the communication to Mrs. Norris as much as Fanny herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
deprecated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mistaken but well-meaning zeal. Sir Thomas, indeed, was,
by this time, not very far from classing Mrs. Norris as one of those
well-meaning people who are always doing mistaken and very disagreeable
things.

<p/>Mrs. Norris, however, relieved him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) pressed for the strictest
forbearance and silence towards their niece; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) not only promised, but
did observe it. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) only looked her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) increased ill-will. Angry she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was:
bitterly angry; but she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was more angry with Fanny for having received
such an offer than for refusing it. It was an injury and affront to
Julia, who ought to have been Mr. Crawford’s choice; and, independently
of that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) disliked Fanny, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had neglected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would have grudged such an elevation to one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been always
trying to depress.

<p/>Sir Thomas gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more credit for discretion on the occasion than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
deserved; and Fanny could have blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for allowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) displeasure, and not to hear it.

<p/>Lady Bertram took it differently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had been a beauty, and a
prosperous beauty, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) life; and beauty and wealth were all that
excited her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) respect. To know Fanny to be sought in marriage by a man of
fortune, raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), therefore, very much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opinion. By convincing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Fanny _was_ very pretty, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been doubting about
before, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be advantageously married, it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel
a sort of credit in calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) niece.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as soon as they were alone together
afterwards, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) really had known something like impatience to be
alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke, had extraordinary
animation; "Well, Fanny, I have had a very agreeable surprise this
morning. I must just speak of it _once_, I told Sir Thomas I must
_once_, and then I shall have done. I give you joy, my dear niece." And
looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) complacently, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) added, "Humph, we certainly are a
handsome family!"

<p/>Fanny coloured, and doubted at first what to say; when, hoping to
assail her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) vulnerable side, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presently answered—

<p/>"My dear aunt, _you_ cannot wish me to do differently from what I have
done, I am sure. _You_ cannot wish me to marry; for you would miss me,
should not you? Yes, I am sure you would miss me too much for that."

<p/>"No, my dear, I should not think of missing you, when such an offer as
this comes in your way. I could do very well without you, if you were
married to a man of such good estate as Mr. Crawford. And you must be
aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman’s duty to accept such a very
unexceptionable offer as this."

<p/>This was almost the only rule of conduct, the only piece of advice,
which Fanny had ever received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt in the course of eight
years and a half. It silenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt how unprofitable contention
would be. If her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s feelings were against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), nothing could be
hoped from attacking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) understanding. Lady Bertram was quite
talkative.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will tell you what, Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), "I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) fell in love
with you at the ball; I am sure the mischief was done that evening. You
did look remarkably well. Everybody said so. Sir Thomas said so. And
you know you had Chapman to help you to dress. I am very glad I sent
Chapman to you. I shall tell Sir Thomas that I am sure it was done that
evening." And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon
afterwards added, "And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than
I did for Maria: the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a
puppy."
