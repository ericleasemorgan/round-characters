<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was fond of society in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own way. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked very much to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) friends come and see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and from various united causes, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) long residence at Hartfield, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) good nature, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could command the visits of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own little circle, in a great measure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) liked. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not much intercourse with any families beyond that circle; his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) horror of late hours, and large dinner-parties, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) unfit for any acquaintance but such as would visit him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own terms. Fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), Highbury, including Randalls in the same parish, and Donwell Abbey in the parish adjoining, the seat of Mr. Knightley, comprehended many such. Not unfrequently, through Emma's persuasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had some of the chosen and the best to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>): but evening parties were what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) preferred; and, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) fancied himself at any time unequal to company, there was scarcely an evening in the week in which Emma could not make up a card-table for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/>Real, long-standing regard brought the Westons and Mr. Knightley; and by Mr. Elton, a young man living alone without liking it, the privilege of exchanging any vacant evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own blank solitude for the elegancies and society of Mr. Woodhouse's drawing-room, and the smiles of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lovely daughter, was in no danger of being thrown away.

<p/>After these came a second set; among the most come-at-able of whom were Mrs. and Miss Bates, and Mrs. Goddard, three ladies almost always at the service of an invitation from Hartfield, and who were fetched and carried home so often, that Mr. Woodhouse thought it no hardship for either James or the horses. Had it taken place only once a year, it would have been a grievance.

<p/>Mrs. Bates, the widow of a former vicar of Highbury, was a very old lady, almost past every thing but tea and quadrille. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) lived with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) single daughter in a very small way, and was considered with all the regard and respect which a harmless old lady, under such untoward circumstances, can excite. Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter enjoyed a most uncommon degree of popularity for a woman neither young, handsome, rich, nor married. Miss Bates stood in the very worst predicament in the world for having much of the public favour; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had no intellectual superiority to make atonement to herself, or frighten those who might hate her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into outward respect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had never boasted either beauty or cleverness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) youth had passed without distinction, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) middle of life was devoted to the care of a failing mother, and the endeavour to make a small income go as far as possible. And yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was a happy woman, and a woman whom no one named without good-will. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own universal good-will and contented temper which worked such wonders. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) loved every body, was interested in every body's happiness, quicksighted to every body's merits; thought herself a most fortunate creature, and surrounded with blessings in such an excellent mother, and so many good neighbours and friends, and a home that wanted for nothing. The simplicity and cheerfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) nature, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contented and grateful spirit, were a recommendation to every body, and a mine of felicity to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was a great talker upon little matters, which exactly suited Mr. Woodhouse, full of trivial communications and harmless gossip.

<p/>Mrs. Goddard was the mistress of a School not of a seminary, or an establishment, or any thing which professed, in long sentences of refined nonsense, to combine liberal acquirements with elegant morality, upon new principles and new systems and where young ladies for enormous pay might be screwed out of health and into vanity but a real, honest, old-fashioned Boarding-school, where a reasonable quantity of accomplishments were sold at a reasonable price, and where girls might be sent to be out of the way, and scramble themselves into a little education, without any danger of coming back prodigies. Mrs. Goddard's school was in high repute and very deservedly; for Highbury was reckoned a particularly healthy spot: she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had an ample house and garden, gave the children plenty of wholesome food, let them run about a great deal in the summer, and in winter dressed their chilblains with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own hands. It was no wonder that a train of twenty young couple now walked after her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to church. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a plain, motherly kind of woman, who had worked hard in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) youth, and now thought herself entitled to the occasional holiday of a tea-visit; and having formerly owed much to Mr. Woodhouse's kindness, felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) particular claim on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) neat parlour, hung round with fancy-work, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could, and win or lose a few sixpences by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) fireside.

<p/>These were the ladies whom Emma found herself very frequently able to collect; and happy was she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's sake, in the power; though, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was herself concerned, it was no remedy for the absence of Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father look comfortable, and very much pleased with herself for contriving things so well; but the quiet prosings of three such women made her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) feel that every evening so spent was indeed one of the long evenings she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had fearfully anticipated.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) sat one morning, looking forward to exactly such a close of the present day, a note was brought from Mrs. Goddard, requesting, in most respectful terms, to be allowed to bring Miss Smith with her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); a most welcome request: for Miss Smith was a girl of seventeen, whom Emma knew very well by sight, and had long felt an interest in, on account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty. A very gracious invitation was returned, and the evening no longer dreaded by the fair mistress of the mansion.

<p/>Harriet Smith was the natural daughter of somebody. Somebody had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), several years back, at Mrs. Goddard's school, and somebody had lately raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) from the condition of scholar to that of parlour-boarder. This was all that was generally known of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no visible friends but what had been acquired at Highbury, and was now just returned from a long visit in the country to some young ladies who had been at school there with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was a very pretty girl, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) beauty happened to be of a sort which Emma particularly admired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was short, plump, and fair, with a fine bloom, blue eyes, light hair, regular features, and a look of great sweetness, and, before the end of the evening, Emma was as much pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) person, and quite determined to continue the acquaintance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not struck by any thing remarkably clever in Miss Smith's conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) altogether very engaging not inconveniently shy, not unwilling to talk and yet so far from pushing, shewing so proper and becoming a deference, seeming so pleasantly grateful for being admitted to Hartfield, and so artlessly impressed by the appearance of every thing in so superior a style to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had been used to, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must have good sense, and deserve encouragement. Encouragement should be given. Those soft blue eyes, and all those natural graces, should not be wasted on the inferior society of Highbury and its connexions. The acquaintance she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had already formed were unworthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). The friends from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had just parted, though very good sort of people, must be doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) harm. They were a family of the name of Martin, whom Emma well knew by character, as renting a large farm of Mr. Knightley, and residing in the parish of Donwell very creditably, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew Mr. Knightley thought highly of them but they must be coarse and unpolished, and very unfit to be the intimates of a girl who wanted only a little more knowledge and elegance to be quite perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would notice her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would improve her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would detach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) bad acquaintance, and introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) into good society; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would form her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) opinions and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) manners. It would be an interesting, and certainly a very kind undertaking; highly becoming her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own situation in life, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) leisure, and powers.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was so busy in admiring those soft blue eyes, in talking and listening, and forming all these schemes in the in-betweens, that the evening flew away at a very unusual rate; and the supper-table, which always closed such parties, and for which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had been used to sit and watch the due time, was all set out and ready, and moved forwards to the fire, before she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was aware. With an alacrity beyond the common impulse of a spirit which yet was never indifferent to the credit of doing every thing well and attentively, with the real good-will of a mind delighted with its own ideas, did she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) then do all the honours of the meal, and help and recommend the minced chicken and scalloped oysters, with an urgency which she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) knew would be acceptable to the early hours and civil scruples of their guests.

<p/>Upon such occasions poor Mr. Woodhouse's feelings were in sad warfare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) loved to have the cloth laid, because it had been the fashion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) youth, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) conviction of suppers being very unwholesome made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) rather sorry to see any thing put on it; and while his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hospitality would have welcomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) visitors to every thing, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) care for their health made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grieve that they would eat.

<p/>Such another small basin of thin gruel as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own was all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could, with thorough self-approbation, recommend; though he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might constrain himself, while the ladies were comfortably clearing the nicer things, to say:

<p/>"Mrs. Bates, let me propose your venturing on one of these eggs. An egg boiled very soft is not unwholesome. Serle understands boiling an egg better than any body. I would not recommend an egg boiled by any body else; but you need not be afraid, they are very small, you see one of our small eggs will not hurt you. Miss Bates, let Emma help you to a little bit of tart a very little bit. Ours are all apple-tarts. You need not be afraid of unwholesome preserves here. I do not advise the custard. Mrs. Goddard, what say you to half a glass of wine? A small half-glass, put into a tumbler of water? I do not think it could disagree with you."

<p/>Emma allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father to talk but supplied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitors in a much more satisfactory style, and on the present evening had particular pleasure in sending them away happy. The happiness of Miss Smith was quite equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) intentions. Miss Woodhouse was so great a personage in Highbury, that the prospect of the introduction had given as much panic as pleasure; but the humble, grateful little girl went off with highly gratified feelings, delighted with the affability with which Miss Woodhouse had treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) all the evening, and actually shaken hands with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at last!
