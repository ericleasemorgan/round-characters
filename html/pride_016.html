<p/>As no objection was made to the young people’s engagement with
their aunt, and all Mr. Collins’s scruples of leaving Mr. and
Mrs. Bennet for a single evening during his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) visit were most
steadily resisted, the coach conveyed him (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) five cousins at
a suitable hour to Meryton; and the girls had the pleasure of
hearing, as they entered the drawing-room, that Mr. Wickham had
accepted their uncle’s invitation, and was then in the house.

<p/>When this information was given, and they had all taken their
seats, Mr. Collins was at leisure to look around him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and admire,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was so much struck with the size and furniture of the
apartment, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) declared he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) might almost have supposed himself
in the small summer breakfast parlour at Rosings; a comparison
that did not at first convey much gratification; but when Mrs.
Phillips understood from him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) what Rosings was, and who was its
proprietor—when she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had listened to the description of only one
of Lady Catherine’s drawing-rooms, and found that the
chimney-piece alone had cost eight hundred pounds, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt all
the force of the compliment, and would hardly have resented a
comparison with the housekeeper’s room.

<p/>In describing to her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) all the grandeur of Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
mansion, with occasional digressions in praise of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) own humble
abode, and the improvements it was receiving, he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) was happily
employed until the gentlemen joined them; and he (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) found in Mrs.
Phillips a very attentive listener, whose opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>)
consequence increased with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) heard, and who was resolving
to retail it all among her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) neighbours as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) could. To
the girls, who could not listen to their cousin, and who had
nothing to do but to wish for an instrument, and examine their
own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece, the
interval of waiting appeared very long. It was over at last,
however. The gentlemen did approach, and when Mr. Wickham walked
into the room, Elizabeth felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had neither been seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) before, nor thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) since, with the smallest degree
of unreasonable admiration. The officers of the ——shire were in
general a very creditable, gentlemanlike set, and the best of
them were of the present party; but Mr. Wickham was as far beyond
them all in person, countenance, air, and walk, as _they_ were
superior to the broad-faced, stuffy uncle Phillips, breathing
port wine, who followed them into the room.

<p/>Mr. Wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female
eye was turned, and Elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
finally seated himself; and the agreeable manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
immediately fell into conversation, though it was only on its
being a wet night, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feel that the commonest, dullest,
most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill
of the speaker.

<p/>With such rivals for the notice of the fair as Mr. Wickham and
the officers, Mr. Collins seemed to sink into insignificance; to
the young ladies he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) certainly was nothing; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had still at
intervals a kind listener in Mrs. Phillips, and was by her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
watchfulness, most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin.
When the card-tables were placed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had the opportunity of
obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) in turn, by sitting down to whist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know little of the game at present,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), "but I shall be
glad to improve myself, for in my situation in life—" Mrs.
Phillips was very glad for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) compliance, but could not wait for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) reason.

<p/>Mr. Wickham did not play at whist, and with ready delight was he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
received at the other table between Elizabeth and Lydia. At first
there seemed danger of Lydia’s engrossing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) entirely, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
was a most determined talker; but being likewise extremely fond
of lottery tickets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) soon grew too much interested in the
game, too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to
have attention for anyone in particular. Allowing for the common
demands of the game, Mr. Wickham was therefore at leisure to talk
to Elizabeth, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was very willing to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), though what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chiefly wished to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not hope to be told—the
history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) acquaintance with Mr. Darcy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared not even
mention that gentleman. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) curiosity, however, was unexpectedly
relieved. Mr. Wickham began the subject himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) enquired how
far Netherfield was from Meryton; and, after receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
answer, asked in a hesitating manner how long Mr. Darcy had been
staying there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"About a month,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; and then, unwilling to let the
subject drop, added, <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a man of very large property in
Derbyshire, I understand."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>"Yes," replied Mr. Wickham; "his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) estate there is a noble one. A
clear ten thousand per annum. You could not have met with a
person more capable of giving you certain information on that
head than myself, for I have been connected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) family in a
particular manner from my infancy.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could not but look surprised.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div>You may well be surprised, Miss Bennet, at such an assertion,
after seeing, as you probably might, the very cold manner of our
meeting yesterday. Are you much acquainted with Mr. Darcy?"

<p/>"As much as I ever wish to be,<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth very warmly. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
have spent four days in the same house with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
very disagreeable."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have no right to give _my_ opinion,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wickham/Wickham</b></font>)</div>said Wickham, "as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
being agreeable or otherwise. I am not qualified to form one. I
have known him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) too long and too well to be a fair judge. It is
impossible for _me_ to be impartial. But I believe your opinion
of him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) would in general astonish—and perhaps you would not
express it quite so strongly anywhere else. Here you are in your
own family."

<p/>"Upon my word, I say no more _here_ than I might say in any house
in the neighbourhood, except Netherfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) is not at all liked
in Hertfordshire. Everybody is disgusted with his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) pride. You will
not find him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) more favourably spoken of by anyone."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot pretend to be sorry,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wickham/Wickham</b></font>)</div>said Wickham, after a short
interruption, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) or that any man should not be estimated
beyond their deserts; but with _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ I believe it does not often
happen. The world is blinded by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune and consequence, or
frightened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) high and imposing manners, and sees him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) only as
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chooses to be seen."

<p/>"I should take him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), even on _my_ slight acquaintance, to be an
ill-tempered man.<div class="bookquote">" Wickham only shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) head.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wonder," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), at the next opportunity of speaking,
"whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is likely to be in this country much longer."

<p/>"I do not at all know; but I _heard_ nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) going away
when I was at Netherfield. I hope your plans in favour of the
——shire will not be affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) being in the neighbourhood."

<p/>"Oh! no—it is not for _me_ to be driven away by Mr. Darcy. If
_he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ wishes to avoid seeing _me_, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must go. We are not on
friendly terms, and it always gives me pain to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), but I
have no reason for avoiding _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ but what I might proclaim
before all the world, a sense of very great ill-usage, and most
painful regrets at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) being what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father, Miss Bennet,
the late Mr. Darcy, was one of the best men that ever breathed,
and the truest friend I ever had; and I can never be in company
with this Mr. Darcy without being grieved to the soul by a
thousand tender recollections. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to myself has been
scandalous; but I verily believe I could forgive him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) anything and
everything, rather than his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disappointing the hopes and
disgracing the memory of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father."

<p/>Elizabeth found the interest of the subject increase, and
listened with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart; but the delicacy of it prevented
further enquiry.

<p/>Mr. Wickham began to speak on more general topics, Meryton, the
neighbourhood, the society, appearing highly pleased with all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had yet seen, and speaking of the latter with gentle but
very intelligible gallantry.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It was the prospect of constant society, and good society,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
added, "which was my chief inducement to enter the ——shire. I
knew it to be a most respectable, agreeable corps, and my friend
Denny tempted me further by his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) account of their present
quarters, and the very great attentions and excellent
acquaintances Meryton had procured them. Society, I own, is
necessary to me. I have been a disappointed man, and my spirits
will not bear solitude. I _must_ have employment and society. A
military life is not what I was intended for, but circumstances
have now made it eligible. The church _ought_ to have been my
profession—I was brought up for the church, and I should at this
time have been in possession of a most valuable living, had it
pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now."

<p/>"Indeed!"

<p/>"Yes—the late Mr. Darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of
the best living in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) gift. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was my godfather, and excessively
attached to me. I cannot do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) kindness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) meant to
provide for me amply, and thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done it; but when the
living fell, it was given elsewhere."

<p/>"Good heavens!" cried Elizabeth; "but how could _that_ be? How
could his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will be disregarded? Why did you not seek legal
redress?"

<p/>"There was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest
as to give me no hope from law. A man of honour could not have
doubted the intention, but Mr. Darcy chose to doubt it—or to
treat it as a merely conditional recommendation, and to assert
that I had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance,
imprudence—in short anything or nothing. Certain it is, that the
living became vacant two years ago, exactly as I was of an age to
hold it, and that it was given to another man; and no less
certain is it, that I cannot accuse myself of having really done
anything to deserve to lose it. I have a warm, unguarded temper,
and I may have spoken my opinion _of_ him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and _to_ him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), too
freely. I can recall nothing worse. But the fact is, that we are
very different sort of men, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hates me."

<p/>"This is quite shocking! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves to be publicly disgraced."

<p/>"Some time or other he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _will_ be—but it shall not be by _me_.
Till I can forget his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, I can never defy or expose _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth honoured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for such feelings, and thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
handsomer than ever as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed them.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But what," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), after a pause, "can have been his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) motive?
What can have induced him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to behave so cruelly?"

<p/>"A thorough, determined dislike of me—a dislike which I cannot
but attribute in some measure to jealousy. Had the late Mr. Darcy
liked me less, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) son might have borne with me better; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
father’s uncommon attachment to me irritated him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), I believe, very
early in life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not a temper to bear the sort of
competition in which we stood—the sort of preference which was
often given me."

<p/>"I had not thought Mr. Darcy so bad as this—though I have never
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I had not thought so very ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I had supposed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be despising his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fellow-creatures in general, but did not
suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of descending to such malicious revenge, such
injustice, such inhumanity as this."

<p/>After a few minutes’ reflection, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued, "I _do_
remember his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) boasting one day, at Netherfield, of the
implacability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) resentments, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having an unforgiving
temper. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposition must be dreadful."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will not trust myself on the subject,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wickham/Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham; "_I_
can hardly be just to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)."

<p/>Elizabeth was again deep in thought, and after a time exclaimed,
"To treat in such a manner the godson, the friend, the favourite
of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father!" She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could have added, <div class="bookquote">"A young man, too, like
_you_, whose very countenance may vouch for your being
amiable" (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>—but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) contented herself with, "and one, too, who had
probably been his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) companion from childhood, connected together,
as I think you said, in the closest manner!"

<p/>"We were born in the same parish, within the same park; the
greatest part of our youth was passed together; inmates of the
same house, sharing the same amusements, objects of the same
parental care. _My_ father began life in the profession which
your uncle, Mr. Phillips, appears to do so much credit to—but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
gave up everything to be of use to the late Mr. Darcy and devoted
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) time to the care of the Pemberley property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was most
highly esteemed by Mr. Darcy, a most intimate, confidential
friend. Mr. Darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the
greatest obligations to my father’s active superintendence, and
when, immediately before my father’s death, Mr. Darcy gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a
voluntary promise of providing for me, I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_, as of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
affection to myself."

<p/>"How strange!<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How abominable! I wonder that
the very pride of this Mr. Darcy has not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) just to you! If
from no better motive, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should not have been too proud to
be dishonest—for dishonesty I must call it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It _is_ wonderful,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wickham/Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham, "for almost all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) actions
may be traced to pride; and pride had often been his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) best friend.
It has connected him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) nearer with virtue than with any other
feeling. But we are none of us consistent, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) behaviour
to me there were stronger impulses even than pride."

<p/>"Can such abominable pride as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) have ever done him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) good?"

<p/>"Yes. It has often led him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to be liberal and generous, to give
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) money freely, to display hospitality, to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) tenants,
and relieve the poor. Family pride, and _filial_ pride—for he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is
very proud of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) father was—have done this. Not to appear
to disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) family, to degenerate from the popular qualities,
or lose the influence of the Pemberley House, is a powerful
motive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has also _brotherly_ pride, which, with _some_
brotherly affection, makes him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) a very kind and careful guardian
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) sister, and you will hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) generally cried up as the
most attentive and best of brothers."

<p/>"What sort of girl is Miss Darcy?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) head. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I wish I could call her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) amiable. It gives me
pain to speak ill of a Darcy. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is too much like her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
brother—very, very proud. As a child, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was affectionate and
pleasing, and extremely fond of me; and I have devoted hours and
hours to her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) amusement. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is nothing to me now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a
handsome girl, about fifteen or sixteen, and, I understand,
highly accomplished. Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father’s death, her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) home has been
London, where a lady lives with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and superintends her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
education."

<p/>After many pauses and many trials of other subjects, Elizabeth
could not help reverting once more to the first, and saying:

<p/>"I am astonished at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) intimacy with Mr. Bingley! How can Mr.
Bingley, who seems good humour itself, and is, I really believe,
truly amiable, be in friendship with such a man? How can they
suit each other? Do you know Mr. Bingley?"

<p/>"Not at all."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is a sweet-tempered, amiable, charming man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) cannot know
what Mr. Darcy is."

<p/>"Probably not; but Mr. Darcy can please where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) chooses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does
not want abilities. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can be a conversible companion if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
thinks it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) while. Among those who are at all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) equals
in consequence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a very different man from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is to the
less prosperous. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride never deserts him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); but with the rich
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is liberal-minded, just, sincere, rational, honourable, and
perhaps agreeable—allowing something for fortune and figure."

<p/>The whist party soon afterwards breaking up, the players gathered
round the other table and Mr. Collins took his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) station between
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousin Elizabeth and Mrs. Phillips. The usual enquiries as to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) success were made by the latter. It had not been very great;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had lost every point; but when Mrs. Phillips began to express
her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) concern thereupon, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) with much earnest gravity
that it was not of the least importance, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) considered the
money as a mere trifle, and begged that she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) would not make
herself uneasy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know very well, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), "that when persons sit down
to a card-table, they must take their chances of these things,
and happily I am not in such circumstances as to make five
shillings any object. There are undoubtedly many who could not
say the same, but thanks to Lady Catherine de Bourgh, I am
removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Wickham’s attention was caught; and after observing Mr.
Collins for a few moments, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked Elizabeth in a low voice
whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relation was very intimately acquainted with the
family of de Bourgh.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Lady Catherine de Bourgh</b></font>)</div>Lady Catherine de Bourgh," she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) replied, "has very lately given
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) a living. I hardly know how Mr. Collins was first introduced
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) notice, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) certainly has not known her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) long."

<p/>"You know of course that Lady Catherine de Bourgh and Lady Anne
Darcy were sisters; consequently that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) is aunt to the present
Mr. Darcy."

<p/>"No, indeed, I did not. I knew nothing at all of Lady Catherine’s
connections. I never heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) existence till the day before
yesterday."

<p/>"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, Miss de Bourgh, will have a very large fortune,
and it is believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cousin will unite the two
estates."

<p/>This information made Elizabeth smile, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought of poor
Miss Bingley. Vain indeed must be all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) attentions, vain and
useless her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) praise of himself,
if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) were already self-destined for another.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr. Collins,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"speaks highly both of Lady Catherine
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter; but from some particulars that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has related
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, I suspect his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) gratitude misleads him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and that
in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) patroness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is an arrogant,
conceited woman."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be both in a great degree,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Wickham/Wickham</b></font>)</div>replied Wickham; "I
have not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for many years, but I very well remember that I
never liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manners were dictatorial and
insolent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and
clever; but I rather believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) derives part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) abilities
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rank and fortune, part from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) authoritative manner,
and the rest from the pride of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nephew, who chooses that
everyone connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should have an understanding of the
first class."

<p/>Elizabeth allowed that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had given a very rational account of
it, and they continued talking together, with mutual satisfaction
till supper put an end to cards, and gave the rest of the ladies
their share of Mr. Wickham’s attentions. There could be no
conversation in the noise of Mrs. Phillips’s supper party, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manners recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to everybody. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) said, was
said well; and whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did, done gracefully. Elizabeth went
away with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head full of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could think of nothing but of
Mr. Wickham, and of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), all the way home; but
there was not time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) even to mention his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) name as they went,
for neither Lydia nor Mr. Collins were once silent. Lydia talked
incessantly of lottery tickets, of the fish she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had lost and the
fish she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had won; and Mr. Collins in describing the civility of
Mr. and Mrs. Phillips, protesting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did not in the least
regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) losses at whist, enumerating all the dishes at supper,
and repeatedly fearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) crowded his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) cousins, had more to
say than he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could well manage before the carriage stopped at
Longbourn House.
