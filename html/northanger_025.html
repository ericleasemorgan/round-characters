<p/>The next day afforded no opportunity for the proposed examination of
the mysterious apartments. It was Sunday, and the whole time between
morning and afternoon service was required by the general in exercise
abroad or eating cold meat at home; and great as was Catherine’s
curiosity, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) courage was not equal to a wish of exploring them after
dinner, either by the fading light of the sky between six and seven
o’clock, or by the yet more partial though stronger illumination of a
treacherous lamp. The day was unmarked therefore by anything to
interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) imagination beyond the sight of a very elegant monument to
the memory of Mrs. Tilney, which immediately fronted the family pew. By
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eye was instantly caught and long retained; and the perusal of
the highly strained epitaph, in which every virtue was ascribed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
by the inconsolable husband, who must have been in some way or other
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) destroyer, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) even to tears.

<p/>That the general, having erected such a monument, should be able to
face it, was not perhaps very strange, and yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could sit so
boldly collected within its view, maintain so elevated an air, look so
fearlessly around, nay, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should even enter the church, seemed
wonderful to Catherine. Not, however, that many instances of beings
equally hardened in guilt might not be produced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could remember
dozens who had persevered in every possible vice, going on from crime
to crime, murdering whomsoever they chose, without any feeling of
humanity or remorse; till a violent death or a religious retirement
closed their black career. The erection of the monument itself could
not in the smallest degree affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) doubts of Mrs. Tilney’s actual
decease. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) even to descend into the family vault where her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ashes
were supposed to slumber, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to behold the coffin in which they
were said to be enclosed—what could it avail in such a case? Catherine
had read too much not to be perfectly aware of the ease with which a
waxen figure might be introduced, and a supposititious funeral carried
on.

<p/>The succeeding morning promised something better. The general’s early
walk, ill-timed as it was in every other view, was favourable here; and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) to be out of the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) directly proposed to Miss
Tilney the accomplishment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) promise. Eleanor was ready to oblige
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); and Catherine reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as they went of another promise, their
first visit in consequence was to the portrait in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) bed-chamber. It
represented a very lovely woman, with a mild and pensive countenance,
justifying, so far, the expectations of its new observer; but they were
not in every respect answered, for Catherine had depended upon meeting
with features, hair, complexion, that should be the very counterpart,
the very image, if not of Henry’s, of Eleanor’s—the only portraits of
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had been in the habit of thinking, bearing always an equal
resemblance of mother and child. A face once taken was taken for
generations. But here she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was obliged to look and consider and study
for a likeness. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) contemplated it, however, in spite of this
drawback, with much emotion, and, but for a yet stronger interest,
would have left it unwillingly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) agitation as they entered the great gallery was too much for any
endeavour at discourse; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could only look at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) companion. Eleanor’s
countenance was dejected, yet sedate; and its composure spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
inured to all the gloomy objects to which they were advancing. Again
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) passed through the folding doors, again her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hand was upon the
important lock, and Catherine, hardly able to breathe, was turning to
close the former with fearful caution, when the figure, the dreaded
figure of the general himself at the further end of the gallery, stood
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)! The name of <div class="bookquote">"Eleanor"  (<font color='red'><b>daughter intimation</b></font>)</div>at the same moment, in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) loudest
tone, resounded through the building, giving to his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) daughter the first
intimation of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence, and to Catherine terror upon terror. An
attempt at concealment had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first instinctive movement on
perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could scarcely hope to have escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) eye;
and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, who with an apologizing look darted hastily by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), had joined and disappeared with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ran for safety to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
room, and, locking herself in, believed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should never have
courage to go down again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remained there at least an hour, in the
greatest agitation, deeply commiserating the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) poor friend,
and expecting a summons herself from the angry general to attend him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own apartment. No summons, however, arrived; and at last, on seeing
a carriage drive up to the abbey, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was emboldened to descend and
meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) under the protection of visitors. The breakfast-room was gay
with company; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was named to them by the general as the friend of
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) daughter, in a complimentary style, which so well concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
resentful ire, as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel secure at least of life for the
present. And Eleanor, with a command of countenance which did honour to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) character, taking an early occasion of saying to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"My father only wanted me to answer a note,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) began to hope
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had either been unseen by the general, or that from some
consideration of policy she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) should be allowed to suppose herself so.
Upon this trust she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) dared still to remain in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) presence, after the
company left them, and nothing occurred to disturb it.

<p/>In the course of this morning’s reflections, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) came to a resolution
of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) next attempt on the forbidden door alone. It would be
much better in every respect that Eleanor should know nothing of the
matter. To involve her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) in the danger of a second detection, to court
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) into an apartment which must wring her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) heart, could not be the
office of a friend. The general’s utmost anger could not be to herself
what it might be to a daughter; and, besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) thought the
examination itself would be more satisfactory if made without any
companion. It would be impossible to explain to Eleanor the suspicions,
from which the other had, in all likelihood, been hitherto happily
exempt; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) therefore, in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)_ presence, search for those
proofs of the general’s cruelty, which however they might yet have
escaped discovery, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt confident of somewhere drawing forth, in
the shape of some fragmented journal, continued to the last gasp. Of
the way to the apartment she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was now perfectly mistress; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
wished to get it over before Henry’s return, who was expected on the
morrow, there was no time to be lost. The day was bright, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) courage
high; at four o’clock, the sun was now two hours above the horizon, and
it would be only her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) retiring to dress half an hour earlier than usual.

<p/>It was done; and Catherine found herself alone in the gallery before
the clocks had ceased to strike. It was no time for thought; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
hurried on, slipped with the least possible noise through the folding
doors, and without stopping to look or breathe, rushed forward to the
one in question. The lock yielded to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, and, luckily, with no
sullen sound that could alarm a human being. On tiptoe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered; the
room was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but it was some minutes before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could advance
another step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) beheld what fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to the spot and agitated every
feature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw a large, well-proportioned apartment, an handsome
dimity bed, arranged as unoccupied with an housemaid’s care, a bright
Bath stove, mahogany wardrobes, and neatly painted chairs, on which the
warm beams of a western sun gaily poured through two sash windows!
Catherine had expected to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings worked, and worked they
were. Astonishment and doubt first seized them; and a shortly
succeeding ray of common sense added some bitter emotions of shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could not be mistaken as to the room; but how grossly mistaken in
everything else!—in Miss Tilney’s meaning, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own calculation! This
apartment, to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had given a date so ancient, a position so
awful, proved to be one end of what the general’s father had built.
There were two other doors in the chamber, leading probably into
dressing-closets; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had no inclination to open either. Would the
veil in which Mrs. Tilney had last walked, or the volume in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
had last read, remain to tell what nothing else was allowed to whisper?
No: whatever might have been the general’s crimes, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had certainly too
much wit to let them sue for detection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was sick of exploring, and
desired but to be safe in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own room, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own heart only privy
to its folly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was on the point of retreating as softly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
had entered, when the sound of footsteps, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could hardly tell where,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pause and tremble. To be found there, even by a servant, would
be unpleasant; but by the general (and he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) seemed always at hand when
least wanted), much worse! She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) listened—the sound had ceased; and
resolving not to lose a moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) passed through and closed the door.
At that instant a door underneath was hastily opened; someone seemed
with swift steps to ascend the stairs, by the head of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had yet
to pass before she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could gain the gallery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had no power to move.
With a feeling of terror not very definable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes on the
staircase, and in a few moments it gave Henry to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) view. <div class="bookquote">"Mr.
Tilney!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) exclaimed in a voice of more than common astonishment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
looked astonished too. <div class="bookquote">"Good God!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) continued, not attending to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)
address. "How came you here? How came you up that staircase?"

<p/>"How came I up that staircase!<div class="bookquote">" he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) replied, greatly surprised. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Because
it is my nearest way from the stable-yard to my own chamber; and why
should I not come up it?"

<p/>Catherine recollected herself, blushed deeply, and could say no more.
He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seemed to be looking in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) countenance for that explanation which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips did not afford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved on towards the gallery. <div class="bookquote">"And may I
not, in my turn,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) pushed back the folding doors, "ask
how _you_ came here? This passage is at least as extraordinary a road
from the breakfast-parlour to your apartment, as that staircase can be
from the stables to mine."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have been,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, looking down, "to see your mother’s
room."

<p/>"My mother’s room! Is there anything extraordinary to be seen there?"

<p/>"No, nothing at all. I thought you did not mean to come back till
tomorrow."

<p/>"I did not expect to be able to return sooner, when I went away; but
three hours ago I had the pleasure of finding nothing to detain me. You
look pale. I am afraid I alarmed you by running so fast up those
stairs. Perhaps you did not know—you were not aware of their leading
from the offices in common use?"

<p/>"No, I was not. You have had a very fine day for your ride."

<p/>"Very; and does Eleanor leave you to find your way into all the rooms
in the house by yourself?"

<p/>"Oh! No; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) showed me over the greatest part on Saturday—and we were
coming here to these rooms—but only"—dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) voice—"your father
was with us."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And that prevented you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, earnestly regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). "Have
you looked into all the rooms in that passage?"

<p/>"No, I only wanted to see—Is not it very late? I must go and dress."

<p/>"It is only a quarter past four<div class="bookquote">" showing his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) watch—" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and you are not now
in Bath. No theatre, no rooms to prepare for. Half an hour at
Northanger must be enough."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could not contradict it, and therefore suffered herself to be
detained, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) dread of further questions made her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), for the first
time in their acquaintance, wish to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). They walked slowly up
the gallery. <div class="bookquote">"Have you had any letter from Bath since I saw you?"

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, and I am very much surprised. Isabella promised so faithfully to
write directly."

<p/>"Promised so faithfully! A faithful promise! That puzzles me. I have
heard of a faithful performance. But a faithful promise—the fidelity of
promising! It is a power little worth knowing, however, since it can
deceive and pain you. My mother’s room is very commodious, is it not?
Large and cheerful-looking, and the dressing-closets so well disposed!
It always strikes me as the most comfortable apartment in the house,
and I rather wonder that Eleanor should not take it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
sent you to look at it, I suppose?"

<p/>"No."

<p/>"It has been your own doing entirely?" Catherine said nothing. After a
short silence, during which he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had closely observed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, "As
there is nothing in the room in itself to raise curiosity, this must
have proceeded from a sentiment of respect for my mother’s character,
as described by Eleanor, which does honour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) memory. The world, I
believe, never saw a better woman. But it is not often that virtue can
boast an interest such as this. The domestic, unpretending merits of a
person never known do not often create that kind of fervent, venerating
tenderness which would prompt a visit like yours. Eleanor, I suppose,
has talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) a great deal?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, a great deal. That is—no, not much, but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did say was very
interesting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) dying so suddenly"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>(slowly, and with hesitation it was
spoken), "and you—none of you being at home—and your father, I
thought—perhaps had not been very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And from these circumstances,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) replied (his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quick eye fixed on
hers), "you infer perhaps the probability of some
negligence—some<div class="bookquote">"—(involuntarily she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) head)—" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or it may be—of
something still less pardonable.<div class="bookquote">" She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) eyes towards him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) more
fully than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had ever done before. " (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>My mother’s illness," he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
continued, "the seizure which ended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) death, _was_ sudden. The
malady itself, one from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had often suffered, a bilious
fever—its cause therefore constitutional. On the third day, in short,
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could be prevailed on, a physician attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), a very
respectable man, and one in whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had always placed great
confidence. Upon his (<font color='blue'><b>physician</b></font>) opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) danger, two others were called in
the next day, and remained in almost constant attendance for four and
twenty hours. On the fifth day she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) died. During the progress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
disorder, Frederick and I (_we_ were both at home) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) repeatedly;
and from our own observation can bear witness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) having received
every possible attention which could spring from the affection of those
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), or which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) situation in life could command. Poor Eleanor
was absent, and at such a distance as to return only to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mother
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) coffin."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But your father,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, "was _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ afflicted?"

<p/>"For a time, greatly so. You have erred in supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not attached
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), I am persuaded, as well as it was possible for
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to—we have not all, you know, the same tenderness of
disposition—and I will not pretend to say that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
might not often have had much to bear, but though his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) temper injured
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) judgment never did. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) value of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was sincere; and, if not
permanently, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was truly afflicted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) death."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am very glad of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine; "it would have been very
shocking!"

<p/>"If I understand you rightly, you had formed a surmise of such horror
as I have hardly words to—Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful
nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been
judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live.
Remember that we are English, that we are Christians. Consult your own
understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of
what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such
atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetrated
without being known, in a country like this, where social and literary
intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a
neighbourhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay
everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been
admitting?"

<p/>They had reached the end of the gallery, and with tears of shame she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
ran off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own room.
