<p/>As Fanny could not doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answer was conveying a real
disappointment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was rather in expectation, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knowledge of
Miss Crawford’s temper, of being urged again; and though no second
letter arrived for the space of a week, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had still the same feeling
when it did come.

<p/>On receiving it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could instantly decide on its containing little
writing, and was persuaded of its having the air of a letter of haste
and business. Its object was unquestionable; and two moments were
enough to start the probability of its being merely to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) notice
that they should be in Portsmouth that very day, and to throw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) into
all the agitation of doubting what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to do in such a case. If
two moments, however, can surround with difficulties, a third can
disperse them; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had opened the letter, the possibility of
Mr. and Miss Crawford’s having applied to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
permission was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ease. This was the letter—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A most scandalous, ill-natured rumour has just reached me, and I
write, dear Fanny, to warn you against giving the least credit to it,
should it spread into the country. Depend upon it, there is some
mistake, and that a day or two will clear it up; at any rate, that
Henry is blameless, and in spite of a moment’s _etourderie_, thinks of
nobody but you. Say not a word of it; hear nothing, surmise nothing,
whisper nothing till I write again. I am sure it will be all hushed up,
and nothing proved but Rushworth’s folly. If they are gone, I would lay
my life they are only gone to Mansfield Park, and Julia with them. But
why would not you let us come for you? I wish you may not repent
it.—Yours, etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Fanny stood aghast. As no scandalous, ill-natured rumour had reached
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to understand much of this strange
letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could only perceive that it must relate to Wimpole Street
and Mr. Crawford, and only conjecture that something very imprudent had
just occurred in that quarter to draw the notice of the world, and to
excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) jealousy, in Miss Crawford’s apprehension, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heard it.
Miss Crawford need not be alarmed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was only sorry for the
parties concerned and for Mansfield, if the report should spread so
far; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might not. If the Rushworths were gone themselves
to Mansfield, as was to be inferred from what Miss Crawford said, it
was not likely that anything unpleasant should have preceded them, or
at least should make any impression.

<p/>As to Mr. Crawford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might give him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own
disposition, convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not capable of being steadily
attached to any one woman in the world, and shame him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) from persisting
any longer in addressing herself.

<p/>It was very strange! She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had begun to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and to
fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) something more than common; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister
still said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cared for nobody else. Yet there must have been some
marked display of attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin, there must have been some
strong indiscretion, since her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) correspondent was not of a sort to
regard a slight one.

<p/>Very uncomfortable she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was, and must continue, till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heard from Miss
Crawford again. It was impossible to banish the letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
thoughts, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not relieve herself by speaking of it to any
human being. Miss Crawford need not have urged secrecy with so much
warmth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might have trusted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sense of what was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousin.

<p/>The next day came and brought no second letter. Fanny was disappointed.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could still think of little else all the morning; but, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
father came back in the afternoon with the daily newspaper as usual,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so far from expecting any elucidation through such a channel
that the subject was for a moment out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was deep in other musing. The remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) first evening in
that room, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) newspaper, came across her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). No candle
was now wanted. The sun was yet an hour and half above the horizon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had, indeed, been three months there; and the sun’s rays
falling strongly into the parlour, instead of cheering, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) still
more melancholy, for sunshine appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a totally different thing
in a town and in the country. Here, its power was only a glare: a
stifling, sickly glare, serving but to bring forward stains and dirt
that might otherwise have slept. There was neither health nor gaiety in
sunshine in a town. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat in a blaze of oppressive heat, in a cloud
of moving dust, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes could only wander from the walls, marked
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father’s head, to the table cut and notched by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brothers,
where stood the tea-board never thoroughly cleaned, the cups and
saucers wiped in streaks, the milk a mixture of motes floating in thin
blue, and the bread and butter growing every minute more greasy than
even Rebecca’s hands had first produced it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) father read his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
newspaper, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) mother lamented over the ragged carpet as usual,
while the tea was in preparation, and wished Rebecca would mend it; and
Fanny was first roused by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) calling out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), after humphing and
considering over a particular paragraph: <div class="bookquote">"What’s the name of your great
cousins in town, Fan?"

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>A moment’s recollection enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to say, <div class="bookquote">"Rushworth, sir."

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And don’t they live in Wimpole Street?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, sir."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Then, there’s the devil to pay among them, that’s all! There"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>(holding
out the paper to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)); "much good may such fine relations do you. I
don’t know what Sir Thomas may think of such matters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) may be too
much of the courtier and fine gentleman to like his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter the less.
But, by G—! if she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) belonged to _me_, I’d give her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) the rope’s end as
long as I could stand over her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>). A little flogging for man and woman too
would be the best way of preventing such things."

<p/>Fanny read to herself that "it was with infinite concern the newspaper
had to announce to the world a matrimonial _fracas_ in the family of
Mr. R. of Wimpole Street; the beautiful Mrs. R., whose name had not
long been enrolled in the lists of Hymen, and who had promised to
become so brilliant a leader in the fashionable world, having quitted
her (<font color='blue'><b>R.</b></font>) husband’s roof in company with the well-known and captivating Mr.
C., the intimate friend and associate of Mr. R., and it was not known
even to the editor of the newspaper whither they were gone."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a mistake, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny instantly; "it must be a mistake, it
cannot be true; it must mean some other people."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke from the instinctive wish of delaying shame; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke with a
resolution which sprung from despair, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not,
could not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
read. The truth rushed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have spoken at all,
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could even have breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to
herself.

<p/>Mr. Price cared too little about the report to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) much answer.
<div class="bookquote">"It might be all a lie,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) acknowledged; <div class="bookquote">"but so many fine ladies were
going to the devil nowadays that way, that there was no answering for
anybody."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed, I hope it is not true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Price plaintively; "it would
be so very shocking! If I have spoken once to Rebecca about that
carpet, I am sure I have spoke at least a dozen times; have not I,
Betsey? And it would not be ten minutes’ work."

<p/>The horror of a mind like Fanny’s, as it received the conviction of
such guilt, and began to take in some part of the misery that must
ensue, can hardly be described. At first, it was a sort of
stupefaction; but every moment was quickening her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) perception of the
horrible evil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dared not indulge a hope, of
the paragraph being false. Miss Crawford’s letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had read
so often as to make every line her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own, was in frightful conformity
with it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eager defence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hope of its being
_hushed_ _up_, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) evident agitation, were all of a piece with
something very bad; and if there was a woman of character in existence,
who could treat as a trifle this sin of the first magnitude, who would
try to gloss it over, and desire to have it unpunished, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
believe Miss Crawford to be the woman! Now she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own
mistake as to _who_ were gone, or _said_ to be gone. It was not Mr. and
Mrs. Rushworth; it was Mrs. Rushworth and Mr. Crawford.

<p/>Fanny seemed to herself never to have been shocked before. There was no
possibility of rest. The evening passed without a pause of misery, the
night was totally sleepless. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed only from feelings of sickness
to shudderings of horror; and from hot fits of fever to cold. The event
was so shocking, that there were moments even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart revolted
from it as impossible: when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought it could not be. A woman
married only six months ago; a man professing himself devoted, even
_engaged_ to another; that other her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) near relation; the whole family,
both families connected as they were by tie upon tie; all friends, all
intimate together! It was too horrible a confusion of guilt, too gross
a complication of evil, for human nature, not in a state of utter
barbarism, to be capable of! yet her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) judgment told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) it was so. _His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_
unsettled affections, wavering with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) vanity, _Maria’s_ decided
attachment, and no sufficient principle on either side, gave it
possibility: Miss Crawford’s letter stampt it a fact.

<p/>What would be the consequence? Whom would it not injure? Whose views
might it not affect? Whose peace would it not cut up for ever? Miss
Crawford, herself, Edmund; but it was dangerous, perhaps, to tread such
ground. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) confined herself, or tried to confine herself, to the
simple, indubitable family misery which must envelop all, if it were
indeed a matter of certified guilt and public exposure. The mother’s
sufferings, the father’s; there she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) paused. Julia’s, Tom’s, Edmund’s;
there a yet longer pause. They were the two on whom it would fall most
horribly. Sir Thomas’s parental solicitude and high sense of honour and
decorum, Edmund’s upright principles, unsuspicious temper, and genuine
strength of feeling, made her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) think it scarcely possible for them to
support life and reason under such disgrace; and it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
that, as far as this world alone was concerned, the greatest blessing
to every one of kindred with Mrs. Rushworth would be instant
annihilation.

<p/>Nothing happened the next day, or the next, to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) terrors. Two
posts came in, and brought no refutation, public or private. There was
no second letter to explain away the first from Miss Crawford; there
was no intelligence from Mansfield, though it was now full time for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
to hear again from her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) aunt. This was an evil omen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, indeed,
scarcely the shadow of a hope to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind, and was reduced to so
low and wan and trembling a condition, as no mother, not unkind, except
Mrs. Price could have overlooked, when the third day did bring the
sickening knock, and a letter was again put into her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hands. It bore the
London postmark, and came from Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear Fanny,—You know our present wretchedness. May God support you
under your share! We have been here two days, but there is nothing to
be done. They cannot be traced. You may not have heard of the last
blow—Julia’s elopement; she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) is gone to Scotland with Yates. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) left
London a few hours before we entered it. At any other time this would
have been felt dreadfully. Now it seems nothing; yet it is an heavy
aggravation. My father is not overpowered. More cannot be hoped. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is
still able to think and act; and I write, by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) desire, to propose
your returning home. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is anxious to get you there for my mother’s
sake. I shall be at Portsmouth the morning after you receive this, and
hope to find you ready to set off for Mansfield. My father wishes you
to invite Susan to go with you for a few months. Settle it as you like;
say what is proper; I am sure you will feel such an instance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
kindness at such a moment! Do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meaning, however I may
confuse it. You may imagine something of my present state. There is no
end of the evil let loose upon us. You will see me early by the
mail.—Yours, etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>Never had Fanny more wanted a cordial. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt such a one as
this letter contained. To-morrow! to leave Portsmouth to-morrow! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was, in the greatest danger of being exquisitely
happy, while so many were miserable. The evil which brought such good
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dreaded lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should learn to be insensible of it. To be
going so soon, sent for so kindly, sent for as a comfort, and with
leave to take Susan, was altogether such a combination of blessings as
set her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) heart in a glow, and for a time seemed to distance every pain,
and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) incapable of suitably sharing the distress even of those
whose distress she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) thought of most. Julia’s elopement could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
comparatively but little; she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was amazed and shocked; but it could not
occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), could not dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) was obliged to call
herself to think of it, and acknowledge it to be terrible and grievous,
or it was escaping her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), in the midst of all the agitating pressing
joyful cares attending this summons to herself.

<p/>There is nothing like employment, active indispensable employment, for
relieving sorrow. Employment, even melancholy, may dispel melancholy,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) occupations were hopeful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had so much to do, that not even
the horrible story of Mrs. Rushworth (now fixed to the last point of
certainty), could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) as it had done before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had not time to
be miserable. Within twenty-four hours she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was hoping to be gone; her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
father and mother must be spoken to, Susan prepared, everything got
ready. Business followed business; the day was hardly long enough. The
happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was imparting, too, happiness very little alloyed by the
black communication which must briefly precede it—the joyful consent of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father and mother to Susan’s going with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)—the general
satisfaction with which the going of both seemed regarded, and the
ecstasy of Susan herself, was all serving to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) spirits.

<p/>The affliction of the Bertrams was little felt in the family. Mrs.
Price talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) poor sister for a few minutes, but how to find
anything to hold Susan’s clothes, because Rebecca took away all the
boxes and spoilt them, was much more in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) thoughts: and as for Susan,
now unexpectedly gratified in the first wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) heart, and knowing
nothing personally of those who had sinned, or of those who were
sorrowing—if she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) could help rejoicing from beginning to end, it was as
much as ought to be expected from human virtue at fourteen.

<p/>As nothing was really left for the decision of Mrs. Price, or the good
offices of Rebecca, everything was rationally and duly accomplished,
and the girls were ready for the morrow. The advantage of much sleep to
prepare them for their journey was impossible. The cousin who was
travelling towards them could hardly have less than visited their
agitated spirits—one all happiness, the other all varying and
indescribable perturbation.

<p/>By eight in the morning Edmund was in the house. The girls heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
entrance from above, and Fanny went down. The idea of immediately
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), with the knowledge of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be suffering, brought
back all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own first feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and in misery. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
ready to sink as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) entered the parlour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was alone, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
instantly; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself pressed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart with only these
words, just articulate, "My Fanny, my only sister; my only comfort
now!" She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could say nothing; nor for some minutes could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) say more.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) turned away to recover himself, and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) spoke again, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
voice still faltered, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) manner shewed the wish of self-command, and
the resolution of avoiding any farther allusion. "Have you breakfasted?
When shall you be ready? Does Susan go?<div class="bookquote">" were questions following each
other rapidly. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) great object was to be off as soon as possible. When
Mansfield was considered, time was precious; and the state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) own
mind made him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) find relief only in motion. It was settled that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) should
order the carriage to the door in half an hour. Fanny answered for
their having breakfasted and being quite ready in half an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had
already ate, and declined staying for their meal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) would walk round
the ramparts, and join them with the carriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) was gone again; glad
to get away even from Fanny.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) looked very ill; evidently suffering under violent emotions, which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) was determined to suppress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew it must be so, but it was
terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>The carriage came; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) entered the house again at the same moment,
just in time to spend a few minutes with the family, and be a
witness—but that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) saw nothing—of the tranquil manner in which the
daughters were parted with, and just in time to prevent their sitting
down to the breakfast-table, which, by dint of much unusual activity,
was quite and completely ready as the carriage drove from the door.
Fanny’s last meal in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father’s house was in character with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
first: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was dismissed from it as hospitably as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been
welcomed.

<p/>How her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart swelled with joy and gratitude as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed the barriers
of Portsmouth, and how Susan’s face wore its broadest smiles, may be
easily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>)
bonnet, those smiles were unseen.

<p/>The journey was likely to be a silent one. Edmund’s deep sighs often
reached Fanny. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) been alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart must have opened
in spite of every resolution; but Susan’s presence drove him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) quite into
himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attempts to talk on indifferent subjects could never
be long supported.

<p/>Fanny watched him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with never-failing solicitude, and sometimes catching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) eye, revived an affectionate smile, which comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but the
first day’s journey passed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hearing a word from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) on the
subjects that were weighing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) down. The next morning produced a
little more. Just before their setting out from Oxford, while Susan was
stationed at a window, in eager observation of the departure of a large
family from the inn, the other two were standing by the fire; and
Edmund, particularly struck by the alteration in Fanny’s looks, and
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ignorance of the daily evils of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father’s house,
attributing an undue share of the change, attributing _all_ to the
recent event, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and said in a low, but very expressive
tone, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No wonder—you must feel it—you must suffer. How a man who had
once loved, could desert you! But _yours_—your regard was new compared
with——Fanny, think of _me_!"

<p/>The first division of their journey occupied a long day, and brought
them, almost knocked up, to Oxford; but the second was over at a much
earlier hour. They were in the environs of Mansfield long before the
usual dinner-time, and as they approached the beloved place, the hearts
of both sisters sank a little. Fanny began to dread the meeting with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunts and Tom, under so dreadful a humiliation; and Susan to feel
with some anxiety, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) best manners, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) lately acquired
knowledge of what was practised here, was on the point of being called
into action. Visions of good and ill breeding, of old vulgarisms and
new gentilities, were before her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) was meditating much upon
silver forks, napkins, and finger-glasses. Fanny had been everywhere
awake to the difference of the country since February; but when they
entered the Park her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) perceptions and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasures were of the keenest
sort. It was three months, full three months, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) quitting it,
and the change was from winter to summer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye fell everywhere on
lawns and plantations of the freshest green; and the trees, though not
fully clothed, were in that delightful state when farther beauty is
known to be at hand, and when, while much is actually given to the
sight, more yet remains for the imagination. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) enjoyment, however,
was for herself alone. Edmund could not share it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>),
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was leaning back, sunk in a deeper gloom than ever, and with
eyes closed, as if the view of cheerfulness oppressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and the
lovely scenes of home must be shut out.

<p/>It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) melancholy again; and the knowledge of what must be
enduring there, invested even the house, modern, airy, and well
situated as it was, with a melancholy aspect.

<p/>By one of the suffering party within they were expected with such
impatience as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never known before. Fanny had scarcely passed the
