<p/>Harriet slept at Hartfield that night. For some weeks past she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been spending more than half her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) time there, and gradually getting to have a bed-room appropriated to herself; and Emma judged it best in every respect, safest and kindest, to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with them as much as possible just at present. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to go the next morning for an hour or two to Mrs. Goddard's, but it was then to be settled that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) should return to Hartfield, to make a regular visit of some days.

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was gone, Mr. Knightley called, and sat some time with Mr. Woodhouse and Emma, till Mr. Woodhouse, who had previously made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind to walk out, was persuaded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter not to defer it, and was induced by the entreaties of both, though against the scruples of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own civility, to leave Mr. Knightley for that purpose. Mr. Knightley, who had nothing of ceremony about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), was offering by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) short, decided answers, an amusing contrast to the protracted apologies and civil hesitations of the other.

<p/>"Well, I believe, if you will excuse me, Mr. Knightley, if you will not consider me as doing a very rude thing, I shall take Emma's advice and go out for a quarter of an hour. As the sun is out, I believe I had better take my three turns while I can. I treat you without ceremony, Mr. Knightley. We invalids think we are privileged people."

<p/>"My dear sir, do not make a stranger of me."

<p/>"I leave an excellent substitute in my daughter. Emma will be happy to entertain you. And therefore I think I will beg your excuse and take my three turns my winter walk."

<p/>"You cannot do better, sir."

<p/>"I would ask for the pleasure of your company, Mr. Knightley, but I am a very slow walker, and my pace would be tedious to you; and, besides, you have another long walk before you, to Donwell Abbey."

<p/>"Thank you, sir, thank you; I am going this moment myself; and I think the sooner you go the better. I will fetch your greatcoat and open the garden door for you."

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse at last was off; but Mr. Knightley, instead of being immediately off likewise, sat down again, seemingly inclined for more chat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) began speaking of Harriet, and speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with more voluntary praise than Emma had ever heard before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot rate her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) beauty as you do,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); "but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a pretty little creature, and I am inclined to think very well of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) disposition. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) character depends upon those she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is with; but in good hands she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will turn out a valuable woman."

<p/>"I am glad you think so; and the good hands, I hope, may not be wanting."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Come,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), "you are anxious for a compliment, so I will tell you that you have improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). You have cured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) school-girl's giggle; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) really does you credit."

<p/>"Thank you. I should be mortified indeed if I did not believe I had been of some use; but it is not every body who will bestow praise where they may. You do not often overpower me with it."

<p/>"You are expecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) again, you say, this morning?"

<p/>"Almost every moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has been gone longer already than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intended."

<p/>"Something has happened to delay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); some visitors perhaps."

<p/>"Highbury gossips! Tiresome wretches!"

<p/>"Harriet may not consider every body tiresome that you would."

<p/>Emma knew this was too true for contradiction, and therefore said nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) presently added, with a smile,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not pretend to fix on times or places, but I must tell you that I have good reason to believe your little friend will soon hear of something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) advantage."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>"Indeed! how so? of what sort?"

<p/>"A very serious sort, I assure you;<div class="bookquote">" still smiling.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Very serious! I can think of but one thing Who is in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)? Who makes you their confidant?"

<p/>Emma was more than half in hopes of Mr. Elton's having dropt a hint. Mr. Knightley was a sort of general friend and adviser, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew Mr. Elton looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have reason to think,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) replied, "that Harriet Smith will soon have an offer of marriage, and from a most unexceptionable quarter: Robert Martin is the man. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) visit to Abbey-Mill, this summer, seems to have done his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is desperately in love and means to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is very obliging,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma; "but is he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sure that Harriet means to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Well, well, means to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) an offer then. Will that do? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to the Abbey two evenings ago, on purpose to consult me about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knows I have a thorough regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) family, and, I believe, considers me as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) best friends. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to ask me whether I thought it would be imprudent in him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to settle so early; whether I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) too young: in short, whether I approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) choice altogether; having some apprehension perhaps of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being considered (especially since your making so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)) as in a line of society above him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). I was very much pleased with all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said. I never hear better sense from any one than Robert Martin. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) always speaks to the purpose; open, straightforward, and very well judging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told me every thing; his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) circumstances and plans, and what they all proposed doing in the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is an excellent young man, both as son and brother. I had no hesitation in advising him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to marry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) proved to me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could afford it; and that being the case, I was convinced he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could not do better. I praised the fair lady too, and altogether sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) away very happy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never esteemed my opinion before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would have thought highly of me then; and, I dare say, left the house thinking me the best friend and counsellor man ever had. This happened the night before last. Now, as we may fairly suppose, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) would not allow much time to pass before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) spoke to the lady, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does not appear to have spoken yesterday, it is not unlikely that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be at Mrs. Goddard's to-day; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) may be detained by a visitor, without thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) at all a tiresome wretch."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pray, Mr. Knightley,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, who had been smiling to herself through a great part of this speech, "how do you know that Mr. Martin did not speak yesterday?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), surprized, "I do not absolutely know it; but it may be inferred. Was not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the whole day with you?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Come,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "I will tell you something, in return for what you have told me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did speak yesterday that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wrote, and was refused."

<p/>This was obliged to be repeated before it could be believed; and Mr. Knightley actually looked red with surprize and displeasure, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stood up, in tall indignation, and said,

<p/>"Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a greater simpleton than I ever believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). What is the foolish girl about?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! to be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, "it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. A man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)."

<p/>"Nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. But what is the meaning of this? Harriet Smith refuse Robert Martin? madness, if it is so; but I hope you are mistaken."

<p/>"I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer! nothing could be clearer."

<p/>"You saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer! you wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) answer too. Emma, this is your doing. You persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)."

<p/>"And if I did, (which, however, I am far from allowing) I should not feel that I had done wrong. Mr. Martin is a very respectable young man, but I cannot admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to be Harriet's equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) should have ventured to address her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). By your account, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does seem to have had some scruples. It is a pity that they were ever got over."

<p/>"Not Harriet's equal!<div class="bookquote">" exclaimed Mr. Knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) equal indeed, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is as much her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) superior in sense as in situation. Emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. What are Harriet Smith's claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than Robert Martin? She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. At her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) age she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) can have no experience, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is pretty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is good tempered, and that is all. My only scruple in advising the match was on his (<font color='blue'><b>boarder</b></font>) account, as being beneath his (<font color='blue'><b>boarder</b></font>) deserts, and a bad connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>boarder</b></font>). I felt that, as to fortune, in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>boarder</b></font>) might do much better; and that as to a rational companion or useful helpmate, he (<font color='blue'><b>boarder</b></font>) could not do worse. But I could not reason so to a man in love, and was willing to trust to there being no harm in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having that sort of disposition, which, in good hands, like his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), might be easily led aright and turn out very well. The advantage of the match I felt to be all on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side; and had not the smallest doubt (nor have I now) that there would be a general cry-out upon her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) extreme good luck. Even your satisfaction I made sure of. It crossed my mind immediately that you would not regret your friend's leaving Highbury, for the sake of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being settled so well. I remember saying to myself, 'Even Emma, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partiality for Harriet, will think this a good match.'"

<p/>"I cannot help wondering at your knowing so little of Emma as to say any such thing. What! think a farmer, (and with all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) sense and all his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) merit Mr. Martin is nothing more,) a good match for my intimate friend! Not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) leaving Highbury for the sake of marrying a man whom I could never admit as an acquaintance of my own! I wonder you should think it possible for me to have such feelings. I assure you mine are very different. I must think your statement by no means fair. You are not just to Harriet's claims. They would be estimated very differently by others as well as myself; Mr. Martin may be the richest of the two, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is undoubtedly her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferior as to rank in society. The sphere in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) moves is much above his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). It would be a degradation."

<p/>"A degradation to illegitimacy and ignorance, to be married to a respectable, intelligent gentleman-farmer!"

<p/>"As to the circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) birth, though in a legal sense she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may be called Nobody, it will not hold in common sense. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is brought up. There can scarcely be a doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father is a gentleman and a gentleman of fortune. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) improvement or comfort. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is a gentleman's daughter, is indubitable to me; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) associates with gentlemen's daughters, no one, I apprehend, will deny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is superior to Mr. Robert Martin."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Whoever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) parents,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, "whoever may have had the charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into what you would call good society. After receiving a very indifferent education she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is left in Mrs. Goddard's hands to shift as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can; to move, in short, in Mrs. Goddard's line, to have Mrs. Goddard's acquaintance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) friends evidently thought this good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and it was good enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) desired nothing better herself. Till you chose to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) into a friend, her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) mind had no distaste for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own set, nor any ambition beyond it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was as happy as possible with the Martins in the summer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had no sense of superiority then. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) has it now, you have given it. You have been no friend to Harriet Smith, Emma. Robert Martin would never have proceeded so far, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not felt persuaded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not being disinclined to him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has too much real feeling to address any woman on the haphazard of selfish passion. And as to conceit, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is the farthest from it of any man I know. Depend upon it he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had encouragement.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>It was most convenient to Emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chose rather to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own line of the subject again.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>You are a very warm friend to Mr. Martin; but, as I said before, are unjust to Harriet. Harriet's claims to marry well are not so contemptible as you represent them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is not a clever girl, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has better sense than you are aware of, and does not deserve to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) understanding spoken of so slightingly. Waiving that point, however, and supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be, as you describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), only pretty and good-natured, let me tell you, that in the degree she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) possesses them, they are not trivial recommendations to the world in general, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is, in fact, a beautiful girl, and must be thought so by ninety-nine people out of an hundred; and till it appears that men are much more philosophic on the subject of beauty than they are generally supposed; till they do fall in love with well-informed minds instead of handsome faces, a girl, with such loveliness as Harriet, has a certainty of being admired and sought after, of having the power of chusing from among many, consequently a claim to be nice. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) good-nature, too, is not so very slight a claim, comprehending, as it does, real, thorough sweetness of temper and manner, a very humble opinion of herself, and a great readiness to be pleased with other people. I am very much mistaken if your sex in general would not think such beauty, and such temper, the highest claims a woman could possess."

<p/>"Upon my word, Emma, to hear you abusing the reason you have, is almost enough to make me think so too. Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do."

<p/>"To be sure!<div class="bookquote">" cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) playfully. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I know that is the feeling of you all. I know that such a girl as Harriet is exactly what every man delights in what at once bewitches his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) senses and satisfies his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgment. Oh! Harriet may pick and chuse. Were you, yourself, ever to marry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) is the very woman for you. And is she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), at seventeen, just entering into life, just beginning to be known, to be wondered at because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does not accept the first offer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) receives? No pray let her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) have time to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have always thought it a very foolish intimacy,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley presently, "though I have kept my thoughts to myself; but I now perceive that it will be a very unfortunate one for Harriet. You will puff her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) up with such ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own beauty, and of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) has a claim to, that, in a little while, nobody within her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reach will be good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Vanity working on a weak head, produces every sort of mischief. Nothing so easy as for a young lady to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expectations too high. Miss Harriet Smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is a very pretty girl. Men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. Men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) parentage came to be revealed. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to expect to marry greatly, and teach her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) may be a parlour-boarder at Mrs. Goddard's all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) life or, at least, (for Harriet Smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master's son."

<p/>"We think so very differently on this point, Mr. Knightley, that there can be no use in canvassing it. We shall only be making each other more angry. But as to my letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) marry Robert Martin, it is impossible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and so decidedly, I think, as must prevent any second application. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must abide by the evil of having refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), whatever it may be; and as to the refusal itself, I will not pretend to say that I might not influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) a little; but I assure you there was very little for me or for any body to do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance is so much against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) manner so bad, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ever were disposed to favour him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) is not now. I can imagine, that before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had seen any body superior, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might tolerate him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was the brother of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friends, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) took pains to please her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and altogether, having seen nobody better (that must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great assistant) she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might not, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was at Abbey-Mill, find him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) disagreeable. But the case is altered now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knows now what gentlemen are; and nothing but a gentleman in education and manner has any chance with Harriet."

<p/>"Nonsense, errant nonsense, as ever was talked!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Knightley. " (<font color='red'><b>Robert Martin</b></font>)</div>Robert Martin's manners have sense, sincerity, and good-humour to recommend them; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mind has more true gentility than Harriet Smith could understand."

<p/>Emma made no answer, and tried to look cheerfully unconcerned, but was really feeling uncomfortable and wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) very much to be gone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not repent what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had done; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still thought herself a better judge of such a point of female right and refinement than he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) could be; but yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a sort of habitual respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) judgment in general, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dislike having it so loudly against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and to have him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) sitting just opposite to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in angry state, was very disagreeable. Some minutes passed in this unpleasant silence, with only one attempt on Emma's side to talk of the weather, but he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) was thinking. The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) thoughts appeared at last in these words.

<p/>"Robert Martin has no great loss if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can but think so; and I hope it will not be long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does. Your views for Harriet are best known to yourself; but as you make no secret of your love of match-making, it is fair to suppose that views, and plans, and projects you have; and as a friend I shall just hint to you that if Elton is the man, I think it will be all labour in vain."

<p/>Emma laughed and disclaimed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) continued,

<p/>"Depend upon it, Elton will not do. Elton is a very good sort of man, and a very respectable vicar of Highbury, but not at all likely to make an imprudent match. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows the value of a good income as well as any body. Elton may talk sentimentally, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will act rationally. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is as well acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own claims, as you can be with Harriet's. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knows that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a very handsome young man, and a great favourite wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) goes; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) general way of talking in unreserved moments, when there are only men present, I am convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) does not mean to throw himself away. I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speak with great animation of a large family of young ladies that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sisters are intimate with, who have all twenty thousand pounds apiece."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am very much obliged to you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing again. "If I had set my heart on Mr. Elton's marrying Harriet, it would have been very kind to open my eyes; but at present I only want to keep Harriet to myself. I have done with match-making indeed. I could never hope to equal my own doings at Randalls. I shall leave off while I am well."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Good morning to you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), rising and walking off abruptly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was very much vexed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) felt the disappointment of the young man, and was mortified to have been the means of promoting it, by the sanction he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given; and the part which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was persuaded Emma had taken in the affair, was provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) exceedingly.

<p/>Emma remained in a state of vexation too; but there was more indistinctness in the causes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)'s, than in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not always feel so absolutely satisfied with herself, so entirely convinced that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinions were right and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) adversary's wrong, as Mr. Knightley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) walked off in more complete self-approbation than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not so materially cast down, however, but that a little time and the return of Harriet were very adequate restoratives. Harriet's staying away so long was beginning to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) uneasy. The possibility of the young man's coming to Mrs. Goddard's that morning, and meeting with Harriet and pleading his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own cause, gave alarming ideas. The dread of such a failure after all became the prominent uneasiness; and when Harriet appeared, and in very good spirits, and without having any such reason to give for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) long absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt a satisfaction which settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own mind, and convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that let Mr. Knightley think or say what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done nothing which woman's friendship and woman's feelings would not justify.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had frightened her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a little about Mr. Elton; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered that Mr. Knightley could not have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had done, neither with the interest, nor (she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must be allowed to tell herself, in spite of Mr. Knightley's pretensions) with the skill of such an observer on such a question as herself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had spoken it hastily and in anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was able to believe, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had rather said what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished resentfully to be true, than what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew any thing about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly might have heard Mr. Elton speak with more unreserve than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever done, and Mr. Elton might not be of an imprudent, inconsiderate disposition as to money matters; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might naturally be rather attentive than otherwise to them; but then, Mr. Knightley did not make due allowance for the influence of a strong passion at war with all interested motives. Mr. Knightley saw no such passion, and of course thought nothing of its effects; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw too much of it to feel a doubt of its overcoming any hesitations that a reasonable prudence might originally suggest; and more than a reasonable, becoming degree of prudence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very sure did not belong to Mr. Elton.

<p/>Harriet's cheerful look and manner established hers: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) came back, not to think of Mr. Martin, but to talk of Mr. Elton. Miss Nash had been telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) something, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) repeated immediately with great delight. Mr. Perry had been to Mrs. Goddard's to attend a sick child, and Miss Nash had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had told Miss Nash, that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was coming back yesterday from Clayton Park, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had met Mr. Elton, and found to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) great surprize, that Mr. Elton was actually on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) road to London, and not meaning to return till the morrow, though it was the whist-club night, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been never known to miss before; and Mr. Perry had remonstrated with him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) about it, and told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) how shabby it was in him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), their best player, to absent himself, and tried very much to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to put off his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) journey only one day; but it would not do; Mr. Elton had been determined to go on, and had said in a very particular way indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was going on business which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not put off for any inducement in the world; and something about a very enviable commission, and being the bearer of something exceedingly precious. Mr. Perry could not quite understand him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) was very sure there must be a lady in the case, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) told him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) so; and Mr. Elton only looked very conscious and smiling, and rode off in great spirits. Miss Nash had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) all this, and had talked a great deal more about Mr. Elton; and said, looking so very significantly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>), "that she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) did not pretend to understand what his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) business might be, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) only knew that any woman whom Mr. Elton could prefer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) should think the luckiest woman in the world; for, beyond a doubt, Mr. Elton had not his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) equal for beauty or agreeableness."
