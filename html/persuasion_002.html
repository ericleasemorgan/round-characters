<p/>Mr Shepherd, a civil, cautious lawyer, who, whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) hold
or his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) views on Sir Walter, would rather have the disagreeable prompted
by anybody else, excused himself from offering the slightest hint, and
only begged leave to recommend an implicit reference to the excellent
judgement of Lady Russell, from whose known good sense he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) fully
expected to have just such resolute measures advised as he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) meant to see
finally adopted.

<p/>Lady Russell was most anxiously zealous on the subject, and gave it
much serious consideration.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a woman rather of sound than of
quick abilities, whose difficulties in coming to any decision in this
instance were great, from the opposition of two leading principles.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was of strict integrity herself, with a delicate sense of honour;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was as desirous of saving Sir Walter's feelings, as solicitous
for the credit of the family, as aristocratic in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ideas of what was
due to them, as anybody of sense and honesty could well be.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a
benevolent, charitable, good woman, and capable of strong attachments,
most correct in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) conduct, strict in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) notions of decorum, and with
manners that were held a standard of good-breeding.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had a
cultivated mind, and was, generally speaking, rational and consistent;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had prejudices on the side of ancestry; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had a value for
rank and consequence, which blinded her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) a little to the faults of those
who possessed them.  Herself the widow of only a knight, she (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) gave the
dignity of a baronet all its due; and Sir Walter, independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
claims as an old acquaintance, an attentive neighbour, an obliging
landlord, the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>widow</b></font>) very dear friend, the father of Anne and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sisters, was, as being Sir Walter, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) apprehension, entitled to
a great deal of compassion and consideration under his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) present
difficulties.

<p/>They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was very
anxious to have it done with the least possible pain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) and
Elizabeth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drew up plans of economy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) made exact calculations,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did what nobody else thought of doing:  she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted Anne, who
never seemed considered by the others as having any interest in the
question. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted, and in a degree was influenced by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in
marking out the scheme of retrenchment which was at last submitted to
Sir Walter. Every emendation of Anne's had been on the side of honesty
against importance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted more vigorous measures, a more complete
reformation, a quicker release from debt, a much higher tone of
indifference for everything but justice and equity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If we can persuade your father to all this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell,
looking over her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) paper, "much may be done.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will adopt these
regulations, in seven years he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) will be clear; and I hope we may be able
to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) and Elizabeth, that Kellynch Hall has a respectability
in itself which cannot be affected by these reductions; and that the
true dignity of Sir Walter Elliot will be very far from lessened in the
eyes of sensible people, by acting like a man of principle.  What will
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be doing, in fact, but what very many of our first families have
done, or ought to do?  There will be nothing singular in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) case; and
it is singularity which often makes the worst part of our suffering, as
it always does of our conduct.  I have great hope of prevailing.  We
must be serious and decided; for after all, the person who has
contracted debts must pay them; and though a great deal is due to the
feelings of the gentleman, and the head of a house, like your father,
there is still more due to the character of an honest man."

<p/>This was the principle on which Anne wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father to be
proceeding, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends to be urging him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered it as an act
of indispensable duty to clear away the claims of creditors with all
the expedition which the most comprehensive retrenchments could secure,
and saw no dignity in anything short of it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted it to be
prescribed, and felt as a duty.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rated Lady Russell's influence
highly; and as to the severe degree of self-denial which her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
conscience prompted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed there might be little more difficulty
in persuading them to a complete, than to half a reformation.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and Elizabeth inclined her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to think that the
sacrifice of one pair of horses would be hardly less painful than of
both, and so on, through the whole list of Lady Russell's too gentle
reductions.

<p/>How Anne's more rigid requisitions might have been taken is of little
consequence.  Lady Russell's had no success at all: could not be put up
with, were not to be borne. "What! every comfort of life knocked off!
Journeys, London, servants, horses, table--contractions and
restrictions every where!  To live no longer with the decencies even of
a private gentleman!  No, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would sooner quit Kellynch Hall at once,
than remain in it on such disgraceful terms."

<p/>"Quit Kellynch Hall.<div class="bookquote">"  The hint was immediately taken up by Mr
Shepherd, whose interest was involved in the reality of Sir Walter's
retrenching, and who was perfectly persuaded that nothing would be done
without a change of abode.  " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Since the idea had been started in the
very quarter which ought to dictate, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had no scruple," he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) said, "in
confessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) judgement to be entirely on that side.  It did not
appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) that Sir Walter could materially alter his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) style of
living in a house which had such a character of hospitality and ancient
dignity to support.  In any other place Sir Walter might judge for
himself; and would be looked up to, as regulating the modes of life in
whatever way he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might choose to model his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) household."

<p/>Sir Walter would quit Kellynch Hall; and after a very few days more of
doubt and indecision, the great question of whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) should go was
settled, and the first outline of this important change made out.

<p/>There had been three alternatives, London, Bath, or another house in
the country.  All Anne's wishes had been for the latter.  A small house
in their own neighbourhood, where they might still have Lady Russell's
society, still be near Mary, and still have the pleasure of sometimes
seeing the lawns and groves of Kellynch, was the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
ambition.  But the usual fate of Anne attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in having something
very opposite from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) inclination fixed on.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) disliked Bath, and
did not think it agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and Bath was to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) home.

<p/>Sir Walter had at first thought more of London; but Mr Shepherd felt
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) could not be trusted in London, and had been skilful enough to
dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) from it, and make Bath preferred.  It was a much safer
place for a gentleman in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) predicament:  he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might there be important
at comparatively little expense.  Two material advantages of Bath over
London had of course been given all their weight:  its more convenient
distance from Kellynch, only fifty miles, and Lady Russell's spending
some part of every winter there; and to the very great satisfaction of
Lady Russell, whose first views on the projected change had been for
Bath, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were induced to believe that they should
lose neither consequence nor enjoyment by settling there.

<p/>Lady Russell felt obliged to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) dear Anne's known wishes.  It
would be too much to expect Sir Walter to descend into a small house in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own neighbourhood.  Anne herself would have found the
mortifications of it more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) foresaw, and to Sir Walter's
feelings they must have been dreadful.  And with regard to Anne's
dislike of Bath, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered it as a prejudice and mistake arising,
first, from the circumstance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) having been three years at school
there, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mother's death; and secondly, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) happening to be
not in perfectly good spirits the only winter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had afterwards
spent there with herself.

<p/>Lady Russell was fond of Bath, in short, and disposed to think it must
suit them all; and as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend's health, by passing all the
warm months with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) at Kellynch Lodge, every danger would be avoided;
and it was in fact, a change which must do both health and spirits
good.  Anne had been too little from home, too little seen. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits
were not high.  A larger society would improve them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
be more known.

<p/>The undesirableness of any other house in the same neighbourhood for
Sir Walter was certainly much strengthened by one part, and a very
material part of the scheme, which had been happily engrafted on the
beginning.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not only to quit his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) home, but to see it in the
hands of others; a trial of fortitude, which stronger heads than Sir
Walter's have found too much.  Kellynch Hall was to be let.  This,
however, was a profound secret, not to be breathed beyond their own
circle.

<p/>Sir Walter could not have borne the degradation of being known to
design letting his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) house.  Mr Shepherd had once mentioned the word
<div class="bookquote">"advertise,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr Shepherd</b></font>)</div>but never dared approach it again.  Sir Walter spurned the
idea of its being offered in any manner; forbad the slightest hint
being dropped of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) having such an intention; and it was only on the
supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) being spontaneously solicited by some most
unexceptionable applicant, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own terms, and as a great favour,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would let it at all.

<p/>How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!  Lady Russell
had another excellent one at hand, for being extremely glad that Sir
Walter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) family were to remove from the country.  Elizabeth had
been lately forming an intimacy, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished to see interrupted.
It was with the daughter of Mr Shepherd, who had returned, after an
unprosperous marriage, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's house, with the additional
burden of two children.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a clever young woman, who understood
the art of pleasing--the art of pleasing, at least, at Kellynch Hall;
and who had made herself so acceptable to Miss Elliot, as to have been
already staying there more than once, in spite of all that Lady
Russell, who thought it a friendship quite out of place, could hint of
caution and reserve.

<p/>Lady Russell, indeed, had scarcely any influence with Elizabeth, and
seemed to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), rather because she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would love her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), than because
Elizabeth deserved it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) more than
outward attention, nothing beyond the observances of complaisance; had
never succeeded in any point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to carry, against
previous inclination.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been repeatedly very earnest in trying
to get Anne included in the visit to London, sensibly open to all the
injustice and all the discredit of the selfish arrangements which shut
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) out, and on many lesser occasions had endeavoured to give Elizabeth
the advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own better judgement and experience; but always in
vain:  Elizabeth would go her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own way; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pursued it in
more decided opposition to Lady Russell than in this selection of Mrs
Clay; turning from the society of so deserving a sister, to bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
affection and confidence on one who ought to have been nothing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
but the object of distant civility.

<p/>From situation, Mrs Clay was, in Lady Russell's estimate, a very
unequal, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) character she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) believed a very dangerous companion;
and a removal that would leave Mrs Clay behind, and bring a choice of
more suitable intimates within Miss Elliot's reach, was therefore an
object of first-rate importance.
