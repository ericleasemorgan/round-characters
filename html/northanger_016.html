<p/>Early the next day, a note from Isabella, speaking peace and tenderness
in every line, and entreating the immediate presence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend on a
matter of the utmost importance, hastened Catherine, in the happiest
state of confidence and curiosity, to Edgar’s Buildings. The two
youngest Miss Thorpes were by themselves in the parlour; and, on Anne’s
quitting it to call her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister, Catherine took the opportunity of
asking the other for some particulars of their yesterday’s party. Maria
desired no greater pleasure than to speak of it; and Catherine
immediately learnt that it had been altogether the most delightful
scheme in the world, that nobody could imagine how charming it had
been, and that it had been more delightful than anybody could conceive.
Such was the information of the first five minutes; the second unfolded
thus much in detail—that they had driven directly to the York Hotel,
ate some soup, and bespoke an early dinner, walked down to the
pump-room, tasted the water, and laid out some shillings in purses and
spars; thence adjourned to eat ice at a pastry-cook’s, and hurrying
back to the hotel, swallowed their dinner in haste, to prevent being in
the dark; and then had a delightful drive back, only the moon was not
up, and it rained a little, and Mr. Morland’s horse was so tired he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
could hardly get it along.

<p/>Catherine listened with heartfelt satisfaction. It appeared that Blaize
Castle had never been thought of; and, as for all the rest, there was
nothing to regret for half an instant. Maria’s intelligence concluded
with a tender effusion of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister Anne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
represented as insupportably cross, from being excluded the party.

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will never forgive me, I am sure; but, you know, how could I help
it? John would have me go, for he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) vowed he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) would not drive her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had such thick ankles. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) will not be in good humour
again this month; but I am determined I will not be cross; it is not a
little matter that puts me out of temper."

<p/>Isabella now entered the room with so eager a step, and a look of such
happy importance, as engaged all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend’s notice. Maria was without
ceremony sent away, and Isabella, embracing Catherine, thus began:
"Yes, my dear Catherine, it is so indeed; your penetration has not
deceived you. Oh! That arch eye of yours! It sees through everything.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Catherine replied only by a look of wondering ignorance.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Nay, my beloved, sweetest friend," continued the other, "compose
yourself. I am amazingly agitated, as you perceive. Let us sit down and
talk in comfort. Well, and so you guessed it the moment you had my
note? Sly creature! Oh! My dear Catherine, you alone, who know my
heart, can judge of my present happiness. Your brother is the most
charming of men. I only wish I were more worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). But what will
your excellent father and mother say? Oh! Heavens! When I think of them
I am so agitated!"

<p/>Catherine’s understanding began to awake: an idea of the truth suddenly
darted into her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind; and, with the natural blush of so new an emotion,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cried out, "Good heaven! My dear Isabella, what do you mean? Can
you—can you really be in love with James?"

<p/>This bold surmise, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) soon learnt comprehended but half the
fact. The anxious affection, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was accused of having
continually watched in Isabella’s every look and action, had, in the
course of their yesterday’s party, received the delightful confession
of an equal love. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart and faith were alike engaged to James.
Never had Catherine listened to anything so full of interest, wonder,
and joy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend engaged! New to such circumstances,
the importance of it appeared unspeakably great, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) contemplated
it as one of those grand events, of which the ordinary course of life
can hardly afford a return. The strength of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not
express; the nature of them, however, contented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend. The
happiness of having such a sister was their first effusion, and the
fair ladies mingled in embraces and tears of joy.

<p/>Delighting, however, as Catherine sincerely did in the prospect of the
connection, it must be acknowledged that Isabella far surpassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) in
tender anticipations. <div class="bookquote">"You will be so infinitely dearer to me, my
Catherine, than either Anne or Maria: I feel that I shall be so much
more attached to my dear Morland’s family than to my own."

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/>This was a pitch of friendship beyond Catherine.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are so like your dear brother,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>continued Isabella, "that I quite
doted on you the first moment I saw you. But so it always is with me;
the first moment settles everything. The very first day that Morland
came to us last Christmas—the very first moment I beheld him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)—my heart
was irrecoverably gone. I remember I wore my yellow gown, with my hair
done up in braids; and when I came into the drawing-room, and John
introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), I thought I never saw anybody so handsome before.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here Catherine secretly acknowledged the power of love; for, though
exceedingly fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother, and partial to all his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) endowments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life thought him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) handsome.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remember too, Miss Andrews drank tea with us that evening, and wore
her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) puce-coloured sarsenet; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>) looked so heavenly that I thought
your brother must certainly fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Andrews</b></font>); I could not sleep a
wink all night for thinking of it. Oh! Catherine, the many sleepless
nights I have had on your brother’s account! I would not have you
suffer half what I have done! I am grown wretchedly thin, I know; but I
will not pain you by describing my anxiety; you have seen enough of it.
I feel that I have betrayed myself perpetually—so unguarded in speaking
of my partiality for the church! But my secret I was always sure would
be safe with _you_."

<p/>Catherine felt that nothing could have been safer; but ashamed of an
ignorance little expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared no longer contest the point, nor
refuse to have been as full of arch penetration and affectionate
sympathy as Isabella chose to consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) found, was
preparing to set off with all speed to Fullerton, to make known his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
situation and ask consent; and here was a source of some real agitation
to the mind of Isabella. Catherine endeavoured to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was herself persuaded, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father and mother would never oppose
their son’s wishes. <div class="bookquote">"It is impossible,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), "for parents to be
more kind, or more desirous of their children’s happiness; I have no
doubt of their consenting immediately."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Morland says exactly the same,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>replied Isabella; "and yet I dare not
expect it; my fortune will be so small; they never can consent to it.
Your brother, who might marry anybody!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here Catherine again discerned the force of love.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>Indeed, Isabella, you are too humble. The difference of fortune can be
nothing to signify."

<p/>"Oh! My sweet Catherine, in _your_ generous heart I know it would
signify nothing; but we must not expect such disinterestedness in many.
As for myself, I am sure I only wish our situations were reversed. Had
I the command of millions, were I mistress of the whole world, your
brother would be my only choice.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This charming sentiment, recommended as much by sense as novelty, gave
Catherine a most pleasing remembrance of all the heroines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
acquaintance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend never looked more lovely than
in uttering the grand idea. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure they will consent," was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
frequent declaration; "I am sure they will be delighted with you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For my own part,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, "my wishes are so moderate that the
smallest income in nature would be enough for me. Where people are
really attached, poverty itself is wealth; grandeur I detest: I would
not settle in London for the universe. A cottage in some retired
village would be ecstasy. There are some charming little villas about
Richmond."

<p/>"Richmond!<div class="bookquote">" cried Catherine. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You must settle near Fullerton. You must
be near us."

<p/>"I am sure I shall be miserable if we do not. If I can but be near
_you_, I shall be satisfied. But this is idle talking! I will not allow
myself to think of such things, till we have your father’s answer.
Morland says that by sending it tonight to Salisbury, we may have it
tomorrow. Tomorrow? I know I shall never have courage to open the
letter. I know it will be the death of me."

<p/>A reverie succeeded this conviction—and when Isabella spoke again, it
was to resolve on the quality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wedding-gown.

<p/>Their conference was put an end to by the anxious young lover himself,
who came to breathe his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) parting sigh before he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) set off for Wiltshire.
Catherine wished to congratulate him (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>), but knew not what to say, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eloquence was only in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes. From them, however, the eight parts of
speech shone out most expressively, and James could combine them with
ease. Impatient for the realization of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) hoped at home, his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
adieus were not long; and they would have been yet shorter, had he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) not
been frequently detained by the urgent entreaties of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fair one that
he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) would go. Twice was he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) called almost from the door by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eagerness
to have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) gone. "Indeed, Morland, I must drive you away. Consider how
far you have to ride. I cannot bear to see you linger so. For heaven’s
sake, waste no more time. There, go, go—I insist on it."

<p/>The two friends, with hearts now more united than ever, were
inseparable for the day; and in schemes of sisterly happiness the hours
flew along. Mrs. Thorpe and her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, who were acquainted with
everything, and who seemed only to want Mr. Morland’s consent, to
consider Isabella’s engagement as the most fortunate circumstance
imaginable for their family, were allowed to join their counsels, and
add their quota of significant looks and mysterious expressions to fill
up the measure of curiosity to be raised in the unprivileged younger
sisters. To Catherine’s simple feelings, this odd sort of reserve
seemed neither kindly meant, nor consistently supported; and its
unkindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would hardly have forborne pointing out, had its
inconsistency been less their friend; but Anne and Maria soon set her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
heart at ease by the sagacity of their "I know what"; and the evening
was spent in a sort of war of wit, a display of family ingenuity, on
one side in the mystery of an affected secret, on the other of
undefined discovery, all equally acute.

<p/>Catherine was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend again the next day, endeavouring to
support her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits and while away the many tedious hours before the
delivery of the letters; a needful exertion, for as the time of
reasonable expectation drew near, Isabella became more and more
desponding, and before the letter arrived, had worked herself into a
state of real distress. But when it did come, where could distress be
found? <div class="bookquote">"I have had no difficulty in gaining the consent of my kind
parents, and am promised that everything in their power shall be done
to forward my happiness,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were the first three lines, and in one moment
all was joyful security. The brightest glow was instantly spread over
Isabella’s features, all care and anxiety seemed removed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) spirits
became almost too high for control, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) called herself without
scruple the happiest of mortals.

<p/>Mrs. Thorpe, with tears of joy, embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) daughter, her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
visitor, and could have embraced half the inhabitants of Bath with
satisfaction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) heart was overflowing with tenderness. It was <div class="bookquote">"dear
John"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"dear Catherine"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>at every word; <div class="bookquote">"dear Anne and dear Maria"
 (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>must immediately be made sharers in their felicity; and two <div class="bookquote">"dears"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>at
once before the name of Isabella were not more than that beloved child
had now well earned. John himself was no skulker in joy. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) not only
bestowed on Mr. Morland the high commendation of being one of the
finest fellows in the world, but swore off many sentences in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
praise.

<p/>The letter, whence sprang all this felicity, was short, containing
little more than this assurance of success; and every particular was
deferred till James could write again. But for particulars Isabella
could well afford to wait. The needful was comprised in Mr. Morland’s
promise; his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) honour was pledged to make everything easy; and by what
means their income was to be formed, whether landed property were to be
resigned, or funded money made over, was a matter in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
disinterested spirit took no concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) knew enough to feel secure of
an honourable and speedy establishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) imagination took a
rapid flight over its attendant felicities. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw herself at the end
of a few weeks, the gaze and admiration of every new acquaintance at
Fullerton, the envy of every valued old friend in Putney, with a
carriage at her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) command, a new name on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tickets, and a brilliant
exhibition of hoop rings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) finger.

<p/>When the contents of the letter were ascertained, John Thorpe, who had
only waited its arrival to begin his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) journey to London, prepared to set
off. <div class="bookquote">"Well, Miss Morland,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) alone in the
parlour, <div class="bookquote">"I am come to bid you good-bye."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Catherine wished him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a good
journey. Without appearing to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) walked to the window,
fidgeted about, hummed a tune, and seemed wholly self-occupied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Shall not you be late at Devizes?"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) made no answer;
but after a minute’s silence burst out with, "A famous good thing this
marrying scheme, upon my soul! A clever fancy of Morland’s and Belle’s.
What do you think of it, Miss Morland? _I_ say it is no bad notion."

<p/>"I am sure I think it a very good one."

<p/>"Do you? That’s honest, by heavens! I am glad you are no enemy to
matrimony, however. Did you ever hear the old song <div class="bookquote">‘Going to One
Wedding Brings on Another?’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I say, you will come to Belle’s wedding, I
hope."

<p/>"Yes; I have promised your sister to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), if possible."

<p/>"And then you know"—twisting himself about and forcing a foolish
laugh—"I say, then you know, we may try the truth of this same old
song."

<p/>"May we? But I never sing. Well, I wish you a good journey. I dine with
Miss Tilney today, and must now be going home."

<p/>"Nay, but there is no such confounded hurry. Who knows when we may be
together again? Not but that I shall be down again by the end of a
fortnight, and a devilish long fortnight it will appear to me."

<p/>"Then why do you stay away so long?<div class="bookquote">" replied Catherine—finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
waited for an answer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That is kind of you, however—kind and good-natured. I shall not forget
it in a hurry. But you have more good nature and all that, than anybody
living, I believe. A monstrous deal of good nature, and it is not only
good nature, but you have so much, so much of everything; and then you
have such—upon my soul, I do not know anybody like you."

<p/>"Oh! dear, there are a great many people like me, I dare say, only a
great deal better. Good morning to you."

<p/>"But I say, Miss Morland, I shall come and pay my respects at Fullerton
before it is long, if not disagreeable."

<p/>"Pray do. My father and mother will be very glad to see you."

<p/>"And I hope—I hope, Miss Morland, _you_ will not be sorry to see me."

<p/>"Oh! dear, not at all. There are very few people I am sorry to see.
Company is always cheerful."

<p/>"That is just my way of thinking. Give me but a little cheerful
company, let me only have the company of the people I love, let me only
be where I like and with whom I like, and the devil take the rest, say
I. And I am heartily glad to hear you say the same. But I have a
notion, Miss Morland, you and I think pretty much alike upon most
matters."

<p/>"Perhaps we may; but it is more than I ever thought of. And as to _most
matters_, to say the truth, there are not many that I know my own mind
about."

<p/>"By Jove, no more do I. It is not my way to bother my brains with what
does not concern me. My notion of things is simple enough. Let me only
have the girl I like, say I, with a comfortable house over my head, and
what care I for all the rest? Fortune is nothing. I am sure of a good
income of my own; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had not a penny, why, so much the better."

<p/>"Very true. I think like you there. If there is a good fortune on one
side, there can be no occasion for any on the other. No matter which
has it, so that there is enough. I hate the idea of one great fortune
looking out for another. And to marry for money I think the wickedest
thing in existence. Good day. We shall be very glad to see you at
Fullerton, whenever it is convenient." And away she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) went. It was not in
the power of all his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gallantry to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) longer. With such news to
communicate, and such a visit to prepare for, her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) departure was not to
be delayed by anything in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) nature to urge; and she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) hurried away,
leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) to the undivided consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own happy address,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) explicit encouragement.

<p/>The agitation which she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had herself experienced on first learning her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
brother’s engagement made her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) expect to raise no inconsiderable emotion
in Mr. and Mrs. Allen, by the communication of the wonderful event. How
great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) disappointment! The important affair, which many words of
preparation ushered in, had been foreseen by them both ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
brother’s arrival; and all that they felt on the occasion was
comprehended in a wish for the young people’s happiness, with a remark,
on the gentleman’s side, in favour of Isabella’s beauty, and on the
lady’s, of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) great good luck. It was to Catherine the most surprising
insensibility. The disclosure, however, of the great secret of James’s
going to Fullerton the day before, did raise some emotion in Mrs.
Allen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could not listen to that with perfect calmness, but
repeatedly regretted the necessity of its concealment, wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could
have known his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) intention, wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
went, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) should certainly have troubled him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) best regards
to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) father and mother, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) kind compliments to all the Skinners.
