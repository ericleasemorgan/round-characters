<p/>Marianne, who had never much toleration for any thing like
impertinence, vulgarity, inferiority of parts, or even difference of
taste from herself, was at this time particularly ill-disposed, from
the state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits, to be pleased with the Miss Steeles, or to
encourage their advances; and to the invariable coldness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>)
behaviour towards them, which checked every endeavour at intimacy on
their side, Elinor principally attributed that preference of herself
which soon became evident in the manners of both, but especially of
Lucy, who missed no opportunity of engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in conversation, or of
striving to improve their acquaintance by an easy and frank
communication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sentiments.

<p/>Lucy was naturally clever; her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) remarks were often just and amusing; and
as a companion for half an hour Elinor frequently found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) agreeable;
but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) powers had received no aid from education: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was ignorant and
illiterate; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) deficiency of all mental improvement, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) want of
information in the most common particulars, could not be concealed from
Miss Dashwood, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) constant endeavour to appear to
advantage. Elinor saw, and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for, the neglect of abilities
which education might have rendered so respectable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, with
less tenderness of feeling, the thorough want of delicacy, of
rectitude, and integrity of mind, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) attentions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
assiduities, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) flatteries at the Park betrayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could have no
lasting satisfaction in the company of a person who joined insincerity
with ignorance; whose want of instruction prevented their meeting in
conversation on terms of equality, and whose conduct toward others made
every show of attention and deference towards herself perfectly
valueless.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You will think my question an odd one, I dare say,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
one day, as they were walking together from the park to the
cottage—<div class="bookquote">"but pray, are you personally acquainted with your
sister-in-law’s mother, Mrs. Ferrars?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor _did_ think the question a very odd one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) countenance
expressed it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had never seen Mrs. Ferrars.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>replied Lucy; "I wonder at that, for I thought you must have
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at Norland sometimes. Then, perhaps, you cannot tell me what
sort of a woman she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is?"

<p/>"No," returned Elinor, cautious of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion of Edward’s
mother, and not very desirous of satisfying what seemed impertinent
curiosity; "I know nothing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in such a
way,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, eyeing Elinor attentively as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; "but perhaps
there may be reasons—I wish I might venture; but however I hope you
will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to be
impertinent."

<p/>Elinor made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a civil reply, and they walked on for a few minutes in
silence. It was broken by Lucy, who renewed the subject again by
saying, with some hesitation,

<p/>"I cannot bear to have you think me impertinently curious. I am sure I
would rather do any thing in the world than be thought so by a person
whose good opinion is so well worth having as yours. And I am sure I
should not have the smallest fear of trusting _you;_ indeed, I should
be very glad of your advice how to manage in such an uncomfortable
situation as I am; but, however, there is no occasion to trouble _you_.
I am sorry you do not happen to know Mrs. Ferrars."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sorry I do _not_,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, in great astonishment, "if it
could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). But really I
never understood that you were at all connected with that family, and
therefore I am a little surprised, I confess, at so serious an inquiry
into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) character."

<p/>"I dare say you are, and I am sure I do not at all wonder at it. But if
I dared tell you all, you would not be so much surprised. Mrs. Ferrars
is certainly nothing to me at present—but the time _may_ come—how soon
it will come must depend upon herself—when we may be very intimately
connected.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) looked down as she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said this, amiably bashful, with only one side
glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) companion to observe its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "what do you mean? Are you acquainted
with Mr. Robert Ferrars? Can you be?<div class="bookquote">" And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not feel much
delighted with the idea of such a sister-in-law.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>No," replied Lucy, "not to Mr. _Robert_ Ferrars—I never saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in my
life; but,<div class="bookquote">" fixing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) eldest brother."

<p/>What felt Elinor at that moment? Astonishment, that would have been as
painful as it was strong, had not an immediate disbelief of the
assertion attended it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turned towards Lucy in silent amazement,
unable to divine the reason or object of such a declaration; and though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) complexion varied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) stood firm in incredulity, and felt in no
danger of an hysterical fit, or a swoon.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may well be surprised,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy; "for to be sure you could
have had no idea of it before; for I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) never dropped the
smallest hint of it to you or any of your family; because it was always
meant to be a great secret, and I am sure has been faithfully kept so
by me to this hour. Not a soul of all my relations know of it but Anne,
and I never should have mentioned it to you, if I had not felt the
greatest dependence in the world upon your secrecy; and I really
thought my behaviour in asking so many questions about Mrs. Ferrars
must seem so odd, that it ought to be explained. And I do not think Mr.
Ferrars can be displeased, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) knows I have trusted you, because I
know he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has the highest opinion in the world of all your family, and
looks upon yourself and the other Miss Dashwoods quite as his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) own
sisters."—She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) paused.

<p/>Elinor for a few moments remained silent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) astonishment at what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself
to speak, and to speak cautiously, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said, with calmness of manner,
which tolerably well concealed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) surprise and solicitude—<div class="bookquote">"May I ask
if your engagement is of long standing?"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"We have been engaged these four years."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Four years!"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor, though greatly shocked, still felt unable to believe it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I did not know,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), "that you were even acquainted till the
other day."

<p/>"Our acquaintance, however, is of many years date. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was under my
uncle’s care, you know, a considerable while."

<p/>"Your uncle!"

<p/>"Yes; Mr. Pratt. Did you never hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) talk of Mr. Pratt?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I think I have,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which
increased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) increase of emotion.

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) was four years with my uncle, who lives at Longstaple, near
Plymouth. It was there our acquaintance begun, for my sister and me was
often staying with my uncle, and it was there our engagement was
formed, though not till a year after he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had quitted as a pupil; but he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
was almost always with us afterwards. I was very unwilling to enter
into it, as you may imagine, without the knowledge and approbation of
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) mother; but I was too young, and loved him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) too well, to be so
prudent as I ought to have been. Though you do not know him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) so well as
me, Miss Dashwood, you must have seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be sensible he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
is very capable of making a woman sincerely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said; but after
a moment’s reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, with revived security of Edward’s
honour and love, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion’s falsehood—"Engaged to Mr. Edward
Ferrars!—I confess myself so totally surprised at what you tell me,
that really—I beg your pardon; but surely there must be some mistake of
person or name. We cannot mean the same Mr. Ferrars."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We can mean no other,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy, smiling. "Mr. Edward Ferrars, the
eldest son of Mrs. Ferrars, of Park Street, and brother of your
sister-in-law, Mrs. John Dashwood, is the person I mean; you must allow
that I am not likely to be deceived as to the name of the man on who
all my happiness depends."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is strange,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, "that I
should never have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even mention your name."

<p/>"No; considering our situation, it was not strange. Our first care has
been to keep the matter secret. You knew nothing of me, or my family,
and, therefore, there could be no _occasion_ for ever mentioning my
name to you; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was always particularly afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister’s
suspecting any thing, _that_ was reason enough for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not mentioning
it."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was silent.—Elinor’s security sunk; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command did not
sink with it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Four years you have been engaged,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with a firm voice.

<p/>"Yes; and heaven knows how much longer we may have to wait. Poor
Edward! It puts him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quite out of heart." Then taking a small miniature
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pocket, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, "To prevent the possibility of mistake, be
so good as to look at this face. It does not do him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) justice, to be
sure, but yet I think you cannot be deceived as to the person it was
drew for.—I have had it above these three years."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) put it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hands as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke; and when Elinor saw the
painting, whatever other doubts her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fear of a too hasty decision, or
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish of detecting falsehood might suffer to linger in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could have none of its being Edward’s face. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned it almost
instantly, acknowledging the likeness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have never been able,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy, "to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) my picture in
return, which I am very much vexed at, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has been always so
anxious to get it! But I am determined to set for it the very first
opportunity."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are quite in the right,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor calmly. They then
proceeded a few paces in silence. Lucy spoke first.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), "I have no doubt in the world of your faithfully
keeping this secret, because you must know of what importance it is to
us, not to have it reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never approve of it,
I dare say. I shall have no fortune, and I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is an exceeding
proud woman."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I certainly did not seek your confidence,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; "but you do me
no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on. Your
secret is safe with me; but pardon me if I express some surprise at so
unnecessary a communication. You must at least have felt that my being
acquainted with it could not add to its safety.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) looked earnestly at Lucy, hoping to discover
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) countenance; perhaps the falsehood of the greatest
part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had been saying; but Lucy’s countenance suffered no
change.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was afraid you would think I was taking a great liberty with you,"
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), "in telling you all this. I have not known you long to be
sure, personally at least, but I have known you and all your family by
description a great while; and as soon as I saw you, I felt almost as
if you was an old acquaintance. Besides in the present case, I really
thought some explanation was due to you after my making such particular
inquiries about Edward’s mother; and I am so unfortunate, that I have
not a creature whose advice I can ask. Anne is the only person that
knows of it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) has no judgment at all; indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does me a
great deal more harm than good, for I am in constant fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
betraying me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) does not know how to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tongue, as you must
perceive, and I am sure I was in the greatest fright in the world
t’other day, when Edward’s name was mentioned by Sir John, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
should out with it all. You can’t think how much I go through in my
mind from it altogether. I only wonder that I am alive after what I
have suffered for Edward’s sake these last four years. Every thing in
such suspense and uncertainty; and seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so seldom—we can hardly
meet above twice a-year. I am sure I wonder my heart is not quite
broke.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) took out her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) handkerchief; but Elinor did not feel very
compassionate.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sometimes." continued Lucy, after wiping her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) eyes, "I think whether it
would not be better for us both to break off the matter entirely.<div class="bookquote">" As
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) looked directly at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) companion. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But then at other
times I have not resolution enough for it. I cannot bear the thoughts
of making him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) so miserable, as I know the very mention of such a thing
would do. And on my own account too—so dear as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) is to me—I don’t
think I could be equal to it. What would you advise me to do in such a
case, Miss Dashwood? What would you do yourself?"

<p/>"Pardon me," replied Elinor, startled by the question; "but I can give
you no advice under such circumstances. Your own judgment must direct
you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>continued Lucy, after a few minutes silence on both
sides, "his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) mother must provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) sometime or other; but poor
Edward is so cast down by it! Did you not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dreadful
low-spirited when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was at Barton? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was so miserable when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left us
at Longstaple, to go to you, that I was afraid you would think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
quite ill."

<p/>"Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) come from your uncle’s, then, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) visited us?"

<p/>"Oh, yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been staying a fortnight with us. Did you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
came directly from town?"

<p/>"No," replied Elinor, most feelingly sensible of every fresh
circumstance in favour of Lucy’s veracity; "I remember he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) told us, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had been staying a fortnight with some friends near Plymouth.<div class="bookquote">" She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
remembered too, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own surprise at the time, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mentioning nothing
farther of those friends, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) total silence with respect even to
their names.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>Did not you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sadly out of spirits?<div class="bookquote">" repeated Lucy.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>We did, indeed, particularly so when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first arrived."

<p/>"I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to exert himself for fear you should suspect what was the
matter; but it made him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so melancholy, not being able to stay more than
a fortnight with us, and seeing me so much affected. Poor fellow! I am
afraid it is just the same with him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) now; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) writes in wretched
spirits. I heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) just before I left Exeter;<div class="bookquote">" taking a letter
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) pocket and carelessly showing the direction to Elinor. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You
know his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, I dare say,—a charming one it is; but that is not
written so well as usual. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) was tired, I dare say, for he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had just
filled the sheet to me as full as possible."

<p/>Elinor saw that it _was_ his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could doubt no longer. This
picture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had allowed herself to believe, might have been
accidentally obtained; it might not have been Edward’s gift; but a
correspondence between them by letter, could subsist only under a
positive engagement, could be authorised by nothing else; for a few
moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was almost overcome—her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart sunk within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could hardly stand; but exertion was indispensably necessary; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
struggled so resolutely against the oppression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings, that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) success was speedy, and for the time complete.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Writing to each other,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>said Lucy, returning the letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
pocket, "is the only comfort we have in such long separations. Yes, _I_
have one other comfort in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) picture, but poor Edward has not even
_that_. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had but my picture, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should be easy. I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
a lock of my hair set in a ring when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was at Longstaple last, and
that was some comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) said, but not equal to a picture.
Perhaps you might notice the ring when you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I did,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was
concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had ever felt
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was mortified, shocked, confounded.

<p/>Fortunately for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), they had now reached the cottage, and the
conversation could be continued no farther. After sitting with them a
few minutes, the Miss Steeles returned to the Park, and Elinor was then
at liberty to think and be wretched.
