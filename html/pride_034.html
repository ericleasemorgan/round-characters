<p/>When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate
herself as much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
employment the examination of all the letters which Jane had
written to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) being in Kent. They contained no actual
complaint, nor was there any revival of past occurrences, or any
communication of present suffering. But in all, and in almost
every line of each, there was a want of that cheerfulness which
had been used to characterise her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) style, and which, proceeding
from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly
disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded.
Elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of
uneasiness, with an attention which it had hardly received on the
first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s shameful boast of what misery he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
been able to inflict, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a keener sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s
sufferings. It was some consolation to think that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to
Rosings was to end on the day after the next—and, a still
greater, that in less than a fortnight she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should herself be with
Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
spirits, by all that affection could do.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin was to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); but Colonel Fitzwilliam had
made it clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had no intentions at all, and agreeable as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not mean to be unhappy about him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>).

<p/>While settling this point, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was suddenly roused by the sound
of the door-bell, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spirits were a little fluttered by the
idea of its being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once
before called late in the evening, and might now come to enquire
particularly after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). But this idea was soon banished, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
spirits were very differently affected, when, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) utter
amazement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw Mr. Darcy walk into the room. In an hurried
manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) immediately began an enquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) health, imputing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to a wish of hearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were better. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) answered
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with cold civility. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sat down for a few moments, and then
getting up, walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but
said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in an agitated manner, and thus began:

<p/>"In vain I have struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not
be repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire
and love you."

<p/>Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stared,
coloured, doubted, and was silent. This he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) considered sufficient
encouragement; and the avowal of all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) felt, and had long
felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), immediately followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke well; but there were
feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) inferiority—of its being a degradation—of the family
obstacles which had always opposed to inclination, were dwelt on
with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) suit.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) deeply-rooted dislike, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not be
insensible to the compliment of such a man’s affection, and
though her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) intentions did not vary for an instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was at
first sorry for the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was to receive; till, roused to
resentment by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) subsequent language, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lost all compassion in
anger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tried, however, to compose herself to answer him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with
patience, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should have done. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) concluded with
representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the strength of that attachment which, in
spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) endeavours, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had found impossible to conquer;
and with expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hope that it would now be rewarded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hand. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could easily see
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no doubt of a favourable answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _spoke_ of
apprehension and anxiety, but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance expressed real
security. Such a circumstance could only exasperate farther, and,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ceased, the colour rose into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cheeks, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/>"In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to
express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however
unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation
should be felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now
thank you. But I cannot—I have never desired your good opinion,
and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry
to have occasioned pain to anyone. It has been most unconsciously
done, however, and I hope will be of short duration. The feelings
which, you tell me, have long prevented the acknowledgment of
your regard, can have little difficulty in overcoming it after
this explanation."

<p/>Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes
fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) face, seemed to catch her (<font color='blue'><b>anyone</b></font>) words with no less
resentment than surprise. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) complexion became pale with anger,
and the disturbance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind was visible in every feature. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was struggling for the appearance of composure, and would not
open his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lips till he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believed himself to have attained it. The
pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings dreadful. At length, with a
voice of forced calmness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said:

<p/>"And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of
expecting! I might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so
little _endeavour_ at civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of
small importance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I might as well enquire,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>replied she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "why with so evident a
desire of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that
you liked me against your will, against your reason, and even
against your character? Was not this some excuse for incivility,
if I _was_ uncivil? But I have other provocations. You know I
have. Had not my feelings decided against you—had they been
indifferent, or had they even been favourable, do you think that
any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been
the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the happiness of a most
beloved sister?"

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the
emotion was short, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) listened without attempting to
interrupt her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) continued:

<p/>"I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive
can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You
dare not, you cannot deny, that you have been the principal, if
not the only means of dividing them from each other—of exposing
one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability, and
the other to its derision for disappointed hopes, and involving
them both in misery of the acutest kind."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) was
listening with an air which proved him (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) wholly unmoved by any
feeling of remorse. He (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) even looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with a smile of
affected incredulity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Can you deny that you have done it?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) repeated.

<p/>With assumed tranquillity he (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) then replied: "I have no wish of
denying that I did everything in my power to separate my friend
from your sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)_
I have been kinder than towards myself.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil
reflection, but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to
conciliate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But it is not merely this affair," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued, "on which my
dislike is founded. Long before it had taken place my opinion of
you was decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which
I received many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject,
what can you have to say? In what imaginary act of friendship can
you here defend yourself? or under what misrepresentation can you
here impose upon others?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said
Darcy, in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.

<p/>"Who that knows what his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) misfortunes have been, can help feeling
an interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?"

<p/>"His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) misfortunes!" repeated Darcy contemptuously; "yes, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
misfortunes have been great indeed."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And of your infliction,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth with energy. "You have
reduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) present state of poverty—comparative poverty.
You have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been
designed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). You have deprived the best years of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) life of
that independence which was no less his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) due than his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) desert. You
have done all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
misfortune with contempt and ridicule."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>cried Darcy, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walked with quick steps across the
room, "is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you
hold me! I thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults,
according to this calculation, are heavy indeed! But perhaps,"
added he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), stopping in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walk, and turning towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), "these
offenses might have been overlooked, had not your pride been hurt
by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented
my forming any serious design. These bitter accusations might
have been suppressed, had I, with greater policy, concealed my
struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled
by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by reflection,
by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence. Nor
am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and
just. Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your
connections?—to congratulate myself on the hope of relations,
whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?"

<p/>Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
tried to the utmost to speak with composure when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/>"You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of
your declaration affected me in any other way, than as it spared
me the concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you
behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) start at this, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said nothing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
continued:

<p/>"You could not have made the offer of your hand in any possible
way that would have tempted me to accept it."

<p/>Again his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) astonishment was obvious; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with an
expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went on:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"From the very beginning—from the first moment, I may almost
say—of my acquaintance with you, your manners, impressing me with
the fullest belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your
selfish disdain of the feelings of others, were such as to form
the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have
built so immovable a dislike; and I had not known you a month
before I felt that you were the last man in the world whom I
could ever be prevailed on to marry."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>"You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your
feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have
been. Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and
accept my best wishes for your health and happiness."

<p/>And with these words he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) hastily left the room, and Elizabeth
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the next moment open the front door and quit the house.

<p/>The tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind, was now painfully great. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew not how
to support herself, and from actual weakness sat down and cried
for half-an-hour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reflected on what had
passed, was increased by every review of it. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should
receive an offer of marriage from Mr. Darcy! That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should have
been in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for so many months! So much in love as to
wish to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in spite of all the objections which had made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend’s marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and which must
appear at least with equal force in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own case—was almost
incredible! It was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so
strong an affection. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) abominable pride—his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
shameless avowal of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done with respect to Jane—his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
unpardonable assurance in acknowledging, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not
justify it, and the unfeeling manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had mentioned
Mr. Wickham, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cruelty towards whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not attempted to
deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
attachment had for a moment excited. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) continued in very
agitated reflections till the sound of Lady Catherine’s carriage
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feel how unequal she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to encounter Charlotte’s
observation, and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) room.
