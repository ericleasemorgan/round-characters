<p/>Edward, having carried his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) thanks to Colonel Brandon, proceeded with
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) happiness to Lucy; and such was the excess of it by the time he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
reached Bartlett’s Buildings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was able to assure Mrs.
Jennings, who called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) again the next day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
congratulations, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in such spirits before in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) life.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own happiness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own spirits, were at least very certain; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) joined Mrs. Jennings most heartily in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) expectation of their
being all comfortably together in Delaford Parsonage before Michaelmas.
So far was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), at the same time, from any backwardness to give Elinor
that credit which Edward _would_ give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friendship for them both with the most grateful warmth, was ready to
own all their obligation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and openly declared that no exertion
for their good on Miss Dashwood’s part, either present or future, would
ever surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) capable of doing any thing in
the world for those she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) really valued. As for Colonel Brandon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
not only ready to worship him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) as a saint, but was moreover truly
anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should be treated as one in all worldly concerns;
anxious that his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) tithes should be raised to the utmost; and secretly
resolved to avail herself, at Delaford, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) possibly could,
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) servants, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) carriage, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) cows, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) poultry.

<p/>It was now above a week since John Dashwood had called in Berkeley
Street, and as since that time no notice had been taken by them of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
wife’s indisposition, beyond one verbal enquiry, Elinor began to feel
it necessary to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a visit.—This was an obligation, however, which
not only opposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own inclination, but which had not the assistance
of any encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companions. Marianne, not contented with
absolutely refusing to go herself, was very urgent to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister’s going at all; and Mrs. Jennings, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) carriage was
always at Elinor’s service, so very much disliked Mrs. John Dashwood,
that not even her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) curiosity to see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) looked after the late
discovery, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) strong desire to affront her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) by taking Edward’s
part, could overcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) unwillingness to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) company again. The
consequence was, that Elinor set out by herself to pay a visit, for
which no one could really have less inclination, and to run the risk of
a tête-à-tête with a woman, whom neither of the others had so much
reason to dislike.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was denied; but before the carriage could turn from the
house, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband accidentally came out. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expressed great pleasure
in meeting Elinor, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had been just going to call in
Berkeley Street, and, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that Fanny would be very glad to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to come in.

<p/>They walked up stairs in to the drawing-room.—Nobody was there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Fanny is in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own room, I suppose,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>): "I will go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
presently, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not have the least objection in the
world to seeing _you_. Very far from it, indeed. _Now_ especially there
cannot be—but however, you and Marianne were always great favourites.
Why would not Marianne come?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor made what excuse she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am not sorry to see you alone," he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) replied, "for I have a good deal
to say to you. This living of Colonel Brandon’s—can it be true?—has he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
really given it to Edward?—I heard it yesterday by chance, and was
coming to you on purpose to enquire farther about it."

<p/>"It is perfectly true.—Colonel Brandon has given the living of Delaford
to Edward."

<p/>"Really!—Well, this is very astonishing!—no relationship!—no connection
between them!—and now that livings fetch such a price!—what was the
value of this?"

<p/>"About two hundred a year."

<p/>"Very well—and for the next presentation to a living of that
value—supposing the late incumbent to have been old and sickly, and
likely to vacate it soon—he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) might have got I dare say—fourteen hundred
pounds. And how came he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) not to have settled that matter before this
person’s death? _Now_, indeed it would be too late to sell it, but a
man of Colonel Brandon’s sense! I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should be so improvident in
a point of such common, such natural, concern! Well, I am convinced
that there is a vast deal of inconsistency in almost every human
character. I suppose, however—on recollection—that the case may
probably be _this_. Edward is only to hold the living till the person
to whom the Colonel has really sold the presentation, is old enough to
take it. Aye, aye, that is the fact, depend upon it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor contradicted it, however, very positively; and by relating that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had herself been employed in conveying the offer from Colonel
Brandon to Edward, and, therefore, must understand the terms on which
it was given, obliged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to submit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) authority.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It is truly astonishing!"—he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) cried, after hearing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said—"what
could be the Colonel’s motive?"

<p/>"A very simple one—to be of use to Mr. Ferrars."

<p/>"Well, well; whatever Colonel Brandon may be, Edward is a very lucky
man.—You will not mention the matter to Fanny, however, for though I
have broke it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) bears it vastly well,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) will not like
to hear it much talked of.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor had some difficulty here to refrain from observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
thought Fanny might have borne with composure, an acquisition of wealth
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, by which neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) child could be possibly
impoverished.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Ferrars,<div class="bookquote">" added he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) voice to the tone becoming so
important a subject, " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars</b></font>)</div>knows nothing about it at present, and I believe
it will be best to keep it entirely concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) as long as may
be. When the marriage takes place, I fear she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) must hear of it all."

<p/>"But why should such precaution be used? Though it is not to be
supposed that Mrs. Ferrars can have the smallest satisfaction in
knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son has money enough to live upon, for _that_ must be
quite out of the question; yet why, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) late behaviour, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
supposed to feel at all? She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) has done with her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cast him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off
for ever, and has made all those over whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had any influence, cast
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) off likewise. Surely, after doing so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cannot be imagined liable
to any impression of sorrow or of joy on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) account: she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) cannot be
interested in any thing that befalls him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would not be so weak as
to throw away the comfort of a child, and yet retain the anxiety of a
parent!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah! Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>John/John Dashwood/Mrs. John Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said John, "your reasoning is very good, but it is
founded on ignorance of human nature. When Edward’s unhappy match takes
place, depend upon it his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother will feel as much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had never
discarded him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>); and, therefore every circumstance that may accelerate
that dreadful event, must be concealed from her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) as much as possible.
Mrs. Ferrars can never forget that Edward is her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son."

<p/>"You surprise me; I should think it must nearly have escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) memory
by _this_ time."

<p/>"You wrong her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) exceedingly. Mrs. Ferrars is one of the most
affectionate mothers in the world.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor was silent.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>We think _now_,"—said Mr. Dashwood, after a short pause, "of
_Robert’s_ marrying Miss Morton."

<p/>Elinor, smiling at the grave and decisive importance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother’s
tone, calmly replied,—

<p/>"The lady, I suppose, has no choice in the affair."

<p/>"Choice!—how do you mean?"

<p/>"I only mean that I suppose, from your manner of speaking, it must be
the same to Miss Morton whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Morton</b></font>) marry Edward or Robert."

<p/>"Certainly, there can be no difference; for Robert will now to all
intents and purposes be considered as the eldest son;—and as to any
thing else, they are both very agreeable young men: I do not know that
one is superior to the other."

<p/>Elinor said no more, and John was also for a short time silent.—His (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
reflections ended thus.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Of _one_ thing, my dear sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>kindly taking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand, and speaking
in an awful whisper, "I may assure you;—and I _will_ do it, because I
know it must gratify you. I have good reason to think—indeed I have it
from the best authority, or I should not repeat it, for otherwise it
would be very wrong to say any thing about it,—but I have it from the
very best authority,—not that I ever precisely heard Mrs. Ferrars say
it herself—but her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) daughter _did_, and I have it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>),—that in
short, whatever objections there might be against a certain—a certain
connection, you understand me,—it would have been far preferable to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>),—it would not have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) half the vexation that _this_ does. I
was exceedingly pleased to hear that Mrs. Ferrars considered it in that
light; a very gratifying circumstance you know to us all. <div class="bookquote">‘It would
have been beyond comparison,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said, <div class="bookquote">‘the least evil of the two, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would be glad to compound _now_ for nothing worse.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>But however,
all that is quite out of the question,—not to be thought of or
mentioned—as to any attachment you know, it never could be: all that is
gone by. But I thought I would just tell you of this, because I knew
how much it must please you. Not that you have any reason to regret, my
dear Elinor. There is no doubt of your doing exceedingly well,—quite as
well, or better, perhaps, all things considered. Has Colonel Brandon
been with you lately?"

<p/>Elinor had heard enough, if not to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) vanity, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
self-importance, to agitate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) nerves and fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind;—and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
therefore glad to be spared from the necessity of saying much in reply
herself, and from the danger of hearing any thing more from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
brother, by the entrance of Mr. Robert Ferrars. After a few moments’
chat, John Dashwood, recollecting that Fanny was yet uninformed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
sister’s being there, quitted the room in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and Elinor was
left to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquaintance with Robert, who, by the gay
unconcern, the happy self-complacency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) manner while enjoying so
unfair a division of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother’s love and liberality, to the prejudice
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) banished brother, earned only by his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own dissipated course of
life, and that brother’s integrity, was confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most
unfavourable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) head and heart.

<p/>They had scarcely been two minutes by themselves, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) began to
speak of Edward; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>), too, had heard of the living, and was very
inquisitive on the subject. Elinor repeated the particulars of it, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had given them to John; and their effect on Robert, though very
different, was not less striking than it had been on _him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)_. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) laughed
most immoderately. The idea of Edward’s being a clergyman, and living
in a small parsonage-house, diverted him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) beyond measure;—and when to
that was added the fanciful imagery of Edward reading prayers in a
white surplice, and publishing the banns of marriage between John Smith
and Mary Brown, he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could conceive nothing more ridiculous.

<p/>Elinor, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited in silence and immovable gravity, the
conclusion of such folly, could not restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from being fixed
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with a look that spoke all the contempt it excited. It was a
look, however, very well bestowed, for it relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings,
and gave no intelligence to him (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was recalled from wit to wisdom,
not by any reproof of hers, but by his (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own sensibility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We may treat it as a joke,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), at last, recovering from the
affected laugh which had considerably lengthened out the genuine gaiety
of the moment; "but, upon my soul, it is a most serious business. Poor
Edward! he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is ruined for ever. I am extremely sorry for it; for I know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be a very good-hearted creature; as well-meaning a fellow
perhaps, as any in the world. You must not judge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), Miss Dashwood,
from _your_ slight acquaintance. Poor Edward! His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) manners are certainly
not the happiest in nature. But we are not all born, you know, with the
same powers,—the same address. Poor fellow! to see him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) in a circle of
strangers! To be sure it was pitiable enough; but upon my soul, I
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has as good a heart as any in the kingdom; and I declare and
protest to you I never was so shocked in my life, as when it all burst
forth. I could not believe it. My mother was the first person who told
me of it; and I, feeling myself called on to act with resolution,
immediately said to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘My dear madam, I do not know what you may
intend to do on the occasion, but as for myself, I must say, that if
Edward does marry this young woman, _I_ never will see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again.’  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>That
was what I said immediately. I was most uncommonly shocked, indeed!
Poor Edward! he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has done for himself completely,—shut himself out for
ever from all decent society! But, as I directly said to my mother, I
am not in the least surprised at it; from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) style of education, it
was always to be expected. My poor mother was half frantic."

<p/>"Have you ever seen the lady?"

<p/>"Yes; once, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was staying in this house, I happened to drop in
for ten minutes; and I saw quite enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). The merest awkward
country girl, without style, or elegance, and almost without beauty. I
remember her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) perfectly. Just the kind of girl I should suppose likely
to captivate poor Edward. I offered immediately, as soon as my mother
related the affair to me, to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) myself, and dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from
the match; but it was too late _then_, I found, to do any thing, for
unluckily, I was not in the way at first, and knew nothing of it till
after the breach had taken place, when it was not for me, you know, to
interfere. But had I been informed of it a few hours earlier, I think
it is most probable that something might have been hit on. I certainly
should have represented it to Edward in a very strong light. <div class="bookquote">‘My dear
fellow,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should have said, <div class="bookquote">‘consider what you are doing. You are
making a most disgraceful connection, and such a one as your family are
unanimous in disapproving.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot help thinking, in short, that
means might have been found. But now it is all too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) must be
starved, you know, that is certain; absolutely starved."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) had just settled this point with great composure, when the entrance
of Mrs. John Dashwood put an end to the subject. But though _she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)_ never
spoke of it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own family, Elinor could see its influence on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind, in the something like confusion of countenance with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
entered, and an attempt at cordiality in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) behaviour to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
even proceeded so far as to be concerned to find that Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister were so soon to leave town, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had hoped to see more of
them;—an exertion in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, who attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) into the room,
and hung enamoured over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) accents, seemed to distinguish every thing
that was most affectionate and graceful.
