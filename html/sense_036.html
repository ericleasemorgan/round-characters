<p/>Within a few days after this meeting, the newspapers announced to the
world, that the lady of Thomas Palmer, Esq. was safely delivered of a
son and heir; a very interesting and satisfactory paragraph, at least
to all those intimate connections who knew it before.

<p/>This event, highly important to Mrs. Jennings’s happiness, produced a
temporary alteration in the disposal of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) time, and influenced, in a
like degree, the engagements of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young friends; for as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wished to
be as much as possible with Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) went thither every morning
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was dressed, and did not return till late in the
evening; and the Miss Dashwoods, at the particular request of the
Middletons, spent the whole of every day in Conduit Street. For their
own comfort they would much rather have remained, at least all the
morning, in Mrs. Jennings’s house; but it was not a thing to be urged
against the wishes of everybody. Their hours were therefore made over
to Lady Middleton and the two Miss Steeles, by whom their company, in
fact was as little valued, as it was professedly sought.

<p/>They had too much sense to be desirable companions to the former; and
by the latter they were considered with a jealous eye, as intruding on
_their_ ground, and sharing the kindness which they wanted to
monopolize. Though nothing could be more polite than Lady Middleton’s
behaviour to Elinor and Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not really like them at all.
Because they neither flattered herself nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not
believe them good-natured; and because they were fond of reading, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
fancied them satirical: perhaps without exactly knowing what it was to
be satirical; but _that_ did not signify. It was censure in common use,
and easily given.

<p/>Their presence was a restraint both on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and on Lucy. It checked the
idleness of one, and the business of the other. Lady Middleton was
ashamed of doing nothing before them, and the flattery which Lucy was
proud to think of and administer at other times, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) feared they would
despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) for offering. Miss Steele was the least discomposed of the
three, by their presence; and it was in their power to reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) to
it entirely. Would either of them only have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) a full and minute
account of the whole affair between Marianne and Mr. Willoughby, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would have thought herself amply rewarded for the sacrifice of the best
place by the fire after dinner, which their arrival occasioned. But
this conciliation was not granted; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) often threw out
expressions of pity for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister to Elinor, and more than once dropt
a reflection on the inconstancy of beaux before Marianne, no effect was
produced, but a look of indifference from the former, or of disgust in
the latter. An effort even yet lighter might have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) their
friend. Would they only have laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) about the Doctor! But so
little were they, any more than the others, inclined to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),
that if Sir John dined from home, she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) might spend a whole day without
hearing any other raillery on the subject, than what she (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was kind
enough to bestow on herself.

<p/>All these jealousies and discontents, however, were so totally
unsuspected by Mrs. Jennings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thought it a delightful thing
for the girls to be together; and generally congratulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young
friends every night, on having escaped the company of a stupid old
woman so long. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) joined them sometimes at Sir John’s, sometimes at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own house; but wherever it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) always came in excellent
spirits, full of delight and importance, attributing Charlotte’s well
doing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) own care, and ready to give so exact, so minute a detail
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) situation, as only Miss Steele had curiosity enough to desire.
One thing _did_ disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>); and of that she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) daily complaint.
Mr. Palmer maintained the common, but unfatherly opinion among his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) sex,
of all infants being alike; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could plainly perceive, at
different times, the most striking resemblance between this baby and
every one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) relations on both sides, there was no convincing his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
father of it; no persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to believe that it was not exactly like
every other baby of the same age; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) even be brought to
acknowledge the simple proposition of its being the finest child in the
world.

<p/>I come now to the relation of a misfortune, which about this time
befell Mrs. John Dashwood. It so happened that while her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) two sisters
with Mrs. Jennings were first calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in Harley Street, another
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) acquaintance had dropt in—a circumstance in itself not
apparently likely to produce evil to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). But while the imaginations of
other people will carry them away to form wrong judgments of our
conduct, and to decide on it by slight appearances, one’s happiness
must in some measure be always at the mercy of chance. In the present
instance, this last-arrived lady allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) fancy to so far outrun
truth and probability, that on merely hearing the name of the Miss
Dashwoods, and understanding them to be Mr. Dashwood’s sisters, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
immediately concluded them to be staying in Harley Street; and this
misconstruction produced within a day or two afterwards, cards of
invitation for them as well as for their brother and sister, to a small
musical party at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) house. The consequence of which was, that Mrs.
John Dashwood was obliged to submit not only to the exceedingly great
inconvenience of sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) carriage for the Miss Dashwoods, but, what
was still worse, must be subject to all the unpleasantness of appearing
to treat them with attention: and who could tell that they might not
expect to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a second time? The power of disappointing
them, it was true, must always be hers. But that was not enough; for
when people are determined on a mode of conduct which they know to be
wrong, they feel injured by the expectation of any thing better from
them.

<p/>Marianne had now been brought by degrees, so much into the habit of
going out every day, that it was become a matter of indifference to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went or not: and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) prepared quietly and mechanically
for every evening’s engagement, though without expecting the smallest
amusement from any, and very often without knowing, till the last
moment, where it was to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dress and appearance she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was grown so perfectly indifferent, as
not to bestow half the consideration on it, during the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
toilet, which it received from Miss Steele in the first five minutes of
their being together, when it was finished. Nothing escaped _her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)_
minute observation and general curiosity; she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) saw every thing, and
asked every thing; was never easy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) knew the price of every part
of Marianne’s dress; could have guessed the number of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gowns
altogether with better judgment than Marianne herself, and was not
without hopes of finding out before they parted, how much her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) washing
cost per week, and how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had every year to spend upon herself.
The impertinence of these kind of scrutinies, moreover, was generally
concluded with a compliment, which though meant as its douceur, was
considered by Marianne as the greatest impertinence of all; for after
undergoing an examination into the value and make of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) gown, the
colour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shoes, and the arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hair, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was almost
sure of being told that upon <div class="bookquote">"her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) word she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looked vastly smart, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
dared to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would make a great many conquests."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>With such encouragement as this, was she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dismissed on the present
occasion, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother’s carriage; which they were ready to enter
five minutes after it stopped at the door, a punctuality not very
agreeable to their sister-in-law, who had preceded them to the house of
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) acquaintance, and was there hoping for some delay on their part
that might inconvenience either herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) coachman.

<p/>The events of this evening were not very remarkable. The party, like
other musical parties, comprehended a great many people who had real
taste for the performance, and a great many more who had none at all;
and the performers themselves were, as usual, in their own estimation,
and that of their immediate friends, the first private performers in
England.

<p/>As Elinor was neither musical, nor affecting to be so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) made no
scruple of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes from the grand pianoforte, whenever it
suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and unrestrained even by the presence of a harp, and
violoncello, would fix them at pleasure on any other object in the
room. In one of these excursive glances she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived among a group of
young men, the very he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), who had given them a lecture on toothpick-cases
at Gray’s. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Gray</b></font>) soon afterwards looking at herself, and
speaking familiarly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother; and had just determined to find out
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) name from the latter, when they both came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and Mr.
Dashwood introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as Mr. Robert Ferrars.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with easy civility, and twisted his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) head into a bow
which assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as plainly as words could have done, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was
exactly the coxcomb she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) described to be by Lucy. Happy
had it been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) regard for Edward had depended less on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
own merit, than on the merit of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) nearest relations! For then his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
brother’s bow must have given the finishing stroke to what the
ill-humour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother and sister would have begun. But while she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
wondered at the difference of the two young men, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not find that
the emptiness and conceit of the one, put her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) out of all charity with
the modesty and worth of the other. Why they _were_ different, Robert
explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) himself in the course of a quarter of an hour’s
conversation; for, talking of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother, and lamenting the extreme
_gaucherie_ which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) really believed kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) from mixing in proper
society, he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) candidly and generously attributed it much less to any
natural deficiency, than to the misfortune of a private education;
while he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) himself, though probably without any particular, any material
superiority by nature, merely from the advantage of a public school,
was as well fitted to mix in the world as any other man.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my soul,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) added, "I believe it is nothing more; and so I often
tell my mother, when she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is grieving about it. <div class="bookquote">‘My dear Madam,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
always say to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘you must make yourself easy. The evil is now
irremediable, and it has been entirely your own doing. Why would you be
persuaded by my uncle, Sir Robert, against your own judgment, to place
Edward under private tuition, at the most critical time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) life? If
you had only sent him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Westminster as well as myself, instead of
sending him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to Mr. Pratt’s, all this would have been prevented.’  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>This
is the way in which I always consider the matter, and my mother is
perfectly convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) error.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor would not oppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) opinion, because, whatever might be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
general estimation of the advantage of a public school, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
think of Edward’s abode in Mr. Pratt’s family, with any satisfaction.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You reside in Devonshire, I think,"—was his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) next observation, "in a
cottage near Dawlish."

<p/>Elinor set him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) right as to its situation; and it seemed rather
surprising to him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) that anybody could live in Devonshire, without living
near Dawlish. He (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) bestowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) hearty approbation however on their
species of house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For my own part,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>), "I am excessively fond of a cottage; there
is always so much comfort, so much elegance about them. And I protest,
if I had any money to spare, I should buy a little land and build one
myself, within a short distance of London, where I might drive myself
down at any time, and collect a few friends about me, and be happy. I
advise every body who is going to build, to build a cottage. My friend
Lord Courtland came to me the other day on purpose to ask my advice,
and laid before me three different plans of Bonomi’s. I was to decide
on the best of them. <div class="bookquote">‘My dear Courtland,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I, immediately throwing
them all into the fire, <div class="bookquote">‘do not adopt either of them, but by all means
build a cottage.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And that I fancy, will be the end of it.

<p/>"Some people imagine that there can be no accommodations, no space in a
cottage; but this is all a mistake. I was last month at my friend
Elliott’s, near Dartford. Lady Elliott wished to give a dance. <div class="bookquote">‘But how
can it be done?’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliott</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">‘my dear Ferrars, do tell me how it is to be
managed. There is not a room in this cottage that will hold ten couple,
and where can the supper be?’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>_I_ immediately saw that there could be
no difficulty in it, so I said, <div class="bookquote">‘My dear Lady Elliott, do not be
uneasy. The dining parlour will admit eighteen couple with ease;
card-tables may be placed in the drawing-room; the library may be open
for tea and other refreshments; and let the supper be set out in the
saloon.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Lady Elliott was delighted with the thought. We measured the
dining-room, and found it would hold exactly eighteen couple, and the
affair was arranged precisely after my plan. So that, in fact, you see,
if people do but know how to set about it, every comfort may be as well
enjoyed in a cottage as in the most spacious dwelling."

<p/>Elinor agreed to it all, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) deserved the
compliment of rational opposition.

<p/>As John Dashwood had no more pleasure in music than his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) eldest sister,
his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) mind was equally at liberty to fix on any thing else; and a thought
struck him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) during the evening, which he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wife, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) approbation, when they got home. The consideration of Mrs.
Dennison’s mistake, in supposing his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) sisters their guests, had
suggested the propriety of their being really invited to become such,
while Mrs. Jennings’s engagements kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) from home. The expense would
be nothing, the inconvenience not more; and it was altogether an
attention which the delicacy of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) conscience pointed out to be
requisite to its complete enfranchisement from his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
father. Fanny was startled at the proposal.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not see how it can be done,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), "without affronting Lady
Middleton, for they spend every day with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); otherwise I should be
exceedingly glad to do it. You know I am always ready to pay them any
attention in my power, as my taking them out this evening shows. But
they are Lady Middleton’s visitors. How can I ask them away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband, but with great humility, did not see the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
objection. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They had already spent a week in this manner in Conduit
Street, and Lady Middleton could not be displeased at their giving the
same number of days to such near relations."

<p/>Fanny paused a moment, and then, with fresh vigor, said,

<p/>"My love, I would ask them with all my heart, if it was in my power.
But I had just settled within myself to ask the Miss Steeles to spend a
few days with us. They are very well behaved, good kind of girls; and I
think the attention is due to them, as their uncle did so very well by
Edward. We can ask your sisters some other year, you know; but the Miss
Steeles may not be in town any more. I am sure you will like them;
indeed, you _do_ like them, you know, very much already, and so does my
mother; and they are such favourites with Harry!"

<p/>Mr. Dashwood was convinced. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw the necessity of inviting the Miss
Steeles immediately, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) conscience was pacified by the resolution
of inviting his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sisters another year; at the same time, however, slyly
suspecting that another year would make the invitation needless, by
bringing Elinor to town as Colonel Brandon’s wife, and Marianne as
_their_ visitor.

<p/>Fanny, rejoicing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) escape, and proud of the ready wit that had
procured it, wrote the next morning to Lucy, to request her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) company and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) sister’s, for some days, in Harley Street, as soon as Lady
Middleton could spare them. This was enough to make Lucy really and
reasonably happy. Mrs. Dashwood seemed actually working for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>),
herself; cherishing all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hopes, and promoting all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) views! Such an
opportunity of being with Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) family was, above all things,
the most material to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) interest, and such an invitation the most
gratifying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings! It was an advantage that could not be too
gratefully acknowledged, nor too speedily made use of; and the visit to
Lady Middleton, which had not before had any precise limits, was
instantly discovered to have been always meant to end in two days’
time.

<p/>When the note was shown to Elinor, as it was within ten minutes after
its arrival, it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for the first time, some share in the
expectations of Lucy; for such a mark of uncommon kindness, vouchsafed
on so short an acquaintance, seemed to declare that the good-will
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) arose from something more than merely malice against
herself; and might be brought, by time and address, to do every thing
that Lucy wished. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) flattery had already subdued the pride of Lady
Middleton, and made an entry into the close heart of Mrs. John
Dashwood; and these were effects that laid open the probability of
greater.

<p/>The Miss Steeles removed to Harley Street, and all that reached Elinor
of their influence there, strengthened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation of the event.
Sir John, who called on them more than once, brought home such accounts
of the favour they were in, as must be universally striking. Mrs.
Dashwood had never been so much pleased with any young women in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was with them; had given each of them a needle book made
by some emigrant; called Lucy by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) Christian name; and did not know
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) should ever be able to part with them.
