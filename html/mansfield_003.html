<p/>The first event of any importance in the family was the death of Mr.
Norris, which happened when Fanny was about fifteen, and necessarily
introduced alterations and novelties. Mrs. Norris, on quitting the
Parsonage, removed first to the Park, and afterwards to a small house
of Sir Thomas’s in the village, and consoled herself for the loss of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) husband by considering that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could do very well without him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); and
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) reduction of income by the evident necessity of stricter
economy.

<p/>The living was hereafter for Edmund; and, had his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) uncle died a few
years sooner, it would have been duly given to some friend to hold till
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were old enough for orders. But Tom’s extravagance had, previous to
that event, been so great as to render a different disposal of the next
presentation necessary, and the younger brother must help to pay for
the pleasures of the elder. There was another family living actually
held for Edmund; but though this circumstance had made the arrangement
somewhat easier to Sir Thomas’s conscience, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not but feel it to
be an act of injustice, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) earnestly tried to impress his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest
son with the same conviction, in the hope of its producing a better
effect than anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had yet been able to say or do.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I blush for you, Tom,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) most dignified manner; "I blush
for the expedient which I am driven on, and I trust I may pity your
feelings as a brother on the occasion. You have robbed Edmund for ten,
twenty, thirty years, perhaps for life, of more than half the income
which ought to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). It may hereafter be in my power, or in yours (I
hope it will), to procure him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) better preferment; but it must not be
forgotten that no benefit of that sort would have been beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
natural claims on us, and that nothing can, in fact, be an equivalent
for the certain advantage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is now obliged to forego through the
urgency of your debts."

<p/>Tom listened with some shame and some sorrow; but escaping as quickly
as possible, could soon with cheerful selfishness reflect, firstly,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) had not been half so much in debt as some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) friends;
secondly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father had made a most tiresome piece of work of it;
and, thirdly, that the future incumbent, whoever he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) might be, would, in
all probability, die very soon.

<p/>On Mr. Norris’s death the presentation became the right of a Dr. Grant,
who came consequently to reside at Mansfield; and on proving to be a
hearty man of forty-five, seemed likely to disappoint Mr. Bertram’s
calculations. But <div class="bookquote">"no, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was a short-necked, apoplectic sort of
fellow, and, plied well with good things, would soon pop off."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had a wife about fifteen years his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) junior, but no children; and they
entered the neighbourhood with the usual fair report of being very
respectable, agreeable people.

<p/>The time was now come when Sir Thomas expected his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister-in-law to
claim her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) share in their niece, the change in Mrs. Norris’s situation,
and the improvement in Fanny’s age, seeming not merely to do away any
former objection to their living together, but even to give it the most
decided eligibility; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own circumstances were rendered less
fair than heretofore, by some recent losses on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) West India estate,
in addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son’s extravagance, it became not undesirable
to himself to be relieved from the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) support, and the
obligation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) future provision. In the fullness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) belief that
such a thing must be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mentioned its probability to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife; and the
first time of the subject’s occurring to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) again happening to be when
Fanny was present, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) calmly observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), "So, Fanny, you are
going to leave us, and live with my sister. How shall you like it?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny was too much surprised to do more than repeat her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s words,
" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Going to leave you?"

<p/>"Yes, my dear; why should you be astonished? You have been five years
with us, and my sister always meant to take you when Mr. Norris died.
But you must come up and tack on my patterns all the same."

<p/>The news was as disagreeable to Fanny as it had been unexpected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had never received kindness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, and could not love
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall be very sorry to go away,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with a faltering voice.

<p/>"Yes, I dare say you will; _that’s_ natural enough. I suppose you have
had as little to vex you since you came into this house as any creature
in the world."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope I am not ungrateful, aunt,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny modestly.

<p/>"No, my dear; I hope not. I have always found you a very good girl."

<p/>"And am I never to live here again?"

<p/>"Never, my dear; but you are sure of a comfortable home. It can make
very little difference to you, whether you are in one house or the
other."

<p/>Fanny left the room with a very sorrowful heart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not feel the
difference to be so small, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not think of living with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
with anything like satisfaction. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) met with Edmund she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) distress.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Cousin,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), "something is going to happen which I do not like
at all; and though you have often persuaded me into being reconciled to
things that I disliked at first, you will not be able to do it now. I
am going to live entirely with my aunt Norris."

<p/>"Indeed!"

<p/>"Yes; my aunt Bertram has just told me so. It is quite settled. I am to
leave Mansfield Park, and go to the White House, I suppose, as soon as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) is removed there."

<p/>"Well, Fanny, and if the plan were not unpleasant to you, I should call
it an excellent one."

<p/>"Oh, cousin!"

<p/>"It has everything else in its favour. My aunt is acting like a
sensible woman in wishing for you. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is choosing a friend and
companion exactly where she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ought, and I am glad her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) love of money does
not interfere. You will be what you ought to be to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). I hope it does
not distress you very much, Fanny?"

<p/>"Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I love this house and everything in
it: I shall love nothing there. You know how uncomfortable I feel with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>"I can say nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner to you as a child; but it was the
same with us all, or nearly so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never knew how to be pleasant to
children. But you are now of an age to be treated better; I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
is behaving better already; and when you are her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) only companion, you
_must_ be important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>"I can never be important to any one."

<p/>"What is to prevent you?"

<p/>"Everything. My situation, my foolishness and awkwardness."

<p/>"As to your foolishness and awkwardness, my dear Fanny, believe me, you
never have a shadow of either, but in using the words so improperly.
There is no reason in the world why you should not be important where
you are known. You have good sense, and a sweet temper, and I am sure
you have a grateful heart, that could never receive kindness without
wishing to return it. I do not know any better qualifications for a
friend and companion."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are too kind,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, colouring at such praise; "how shall I
ever thank you as I ought, for thinking so well of me. Oh! cousin, if I
am to go away, I shall remember your goodness to the last moment of my
life."

<p/>"Why, indeed, Fanny, I should hope to be remembered at such a distance
as the White House. You speak as if you were going two hundred miles
off instead of only across the park; but you will belong to us almost
as much as ever. The two families will be meeting every day in the
year. The only difference will be that, living with your aunt, you will
necessarily be brought forward as you ought to be. _Here_ there are too
many whom you can hide behind; but with _her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)_ you will be forced to
speak for yourself."

<p/>"Oh! do not say so."

<p/>"I must say it, and say it with pleasure. Mrs. Norris is much better
fitted than my mother for having the charge of you now. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) is of a
temper to do a great deal for anybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) really interests herself
about, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) will force you to do justice to your natural powers."

<p/>Fanny sighed, and said, "I cannot see things as you do; but I ought to
believe you to be right rather than myself, and I am very much obliged
to you for trying to reconcile me to what must be. If I could suppose
my aunt really to care for me, it would be delightful to feel myself of
consequence to anybody. _Here_, I know, I am of none, and yet I love
the place so well."

<p/>"The place, Fanny, is what you will not quit, though you quit the
house. You will have as free a command of the park and gardens as ever.
Even _your_ constant little heart need not take fright at such a
nominal change. You will have the same walks to frequent, the same
library to choose from, the same people to look at, the same horse to
ride."

<p/>"Very true. Yes, dear old grey pony! Ah! cousin, when I remember how
much I used to dread riding, what terrors it gave me to hear it talked
of as likely to do me good (oh! how I have trembled at my uncle’s
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) lips if horses were talked of), and then think of the kind
pains you took to reason and persuade me out of my fears, and convince
me that I should like it after a little while, and feel how right you
proved to be, I am inclined to hope you may always prophesy as well."

<p/>"And I am quite convinced that your being with Mrs. Norris will be as
good for your mind as riding has been for your health, and as much for
your ultimate happiness too."

<p/>So ended their discourse, which, for any very appropriate service it
could render Fanny, might as well have been spared, for Mrs. Norris had
not the smallest intention of taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). It had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>),
on the present occasion, but as a thing to be carefully avoided. To
prevent its being expected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had fixed on the smallest habitation
which could rank as genteel among the buildings of Mansfield parish,
the White House being only just large enough to receive herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
servants, and allow a spare room for a friend, of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) made a very
particular point. The spare rooms at the Parsonage had never been
wanted, but the absolute necessity of a spare room for a friend was now
never forgotten. Not all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) precautions, however, could save her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) from
being suspected of something better; or, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) very display of
the importance of a spare room might have misled Sir Thomas to suppose
it really intended for Fanny. Lady Bertram soon brought the matter to a
certainty by carelessly observing to Mrs. Norris—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I think, sister, we need not keep Miss Lee any longer, when Fanny goes
to live with you."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Norris almost started. "Live with me, dear Lady Bertram! what do
you mean?"

<p/>"Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) not to live with you? I thought you had settled it with Sir
Thomas."

<p/>"Me! never. I never spoke a syllable about it to Sir Thomas, nor he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to
me. Fanny live with me! the last thing in the world for me to think of,
or for anybody to wish that really knows us both. Good heaven! what
could I do with Fanny? Me! a poor, helpless, forlorn widow, unfit for
anything, my spirits quite broke down; what could I do with a girl at
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) time of life? A girl of fifteen! the very age of all others to need
most attention and care, and put the cheerfullest spirits to the test!
Sure Sir Thomas could not seriously expect such a thing! Sir Thomas is
too much my friend. Nobody that wishes me well, I am sure, would
propose it. How came Sir Thomas to speak to you about it?"

<p/>"Indeed, I do not know. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought it best."

<p/>"But what did he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) say? He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not say he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) _wished_ me to take Fanny. I
am sure in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) heart he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not wish me to do it."

<p/>"No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) only said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought it very likely; and I thought so too. We
both thought it would be a comfort to you. But if you do not like it,
there is no more to be said. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is no encumbrance here."

<p/>"Dear sister, if you consider my unhappy state, how can she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) be any
comfort to me? Here am I, a poor desolate widow, deprived of the best
of husbands, my health gone in attending and nursing him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), my spirits
still worse, all my peace in this world destroyed, with hardly enough
to support me in the rank of a gentlewoman, and enable me to live so as
not to disgrace the memory of the dear departed—what possible comfort
could I have in taking such a charge upon me as Fanny? If I could wish
it for my own sake, I would not do so unjust a thing by the poor girl.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is in good hands, and sure of doing well. I must struggle through
my sorrows and difficulties as I can."

<p/>"Then you will not mind living by yourself quite alone?"

<p/>"Lady Bertram, I do not complain. I know I cannot live as I have done,
but I must retrench where I can, and learn to be a better manager. I
_have_ _been_ a liberal housekeeper enough, but I shall not be ashamed
to practise economy now. My situation is as much altered as my income.
A great many things were due from poor Mr. Norris, as clergyman of the
parish, that cannot be expected from me. It is unknown how much was
consumed in our kitchen by odd comers and goers. At the White House,
matters must be better looked after. I _must_ live within my income, or
I shall be miserable; and I own it would give me great satisfaction to
be able to do rather more, to lay by a little at the end of the year."

<p/>"I dare say you will. You always do, don’t you?"

<p/>"My object, Lady Bertram, is to be of use to those that come after me.
It is for your children’s good that I wish to be richer. I have nobody
else to care for, but I should be very glad to think I could leave a
little trifle among them worth their having."

<p/>"You are very good, but do not trouble yourself about them. They are
sure of being well provided for. Sir Thomas will take care of that."

<p/>"Why, you know, Sir Thomas’s means will be rather straitened if the
Antigua estate is to make such poor returns."

<p/>"Oh! _that_ will soon be settled. Sir Thomas has been writing about it,
I know."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Lady Bertram,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Norris, moving to go, "I can only say
that my sole desire is to be of use to your family: and so, if Sir
Thomas should ever speak again about my taking Fanny, you will be able
to say that my health and spirits put it quite out of the question;
besides that, I really should not have a bed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), for I must
keep a spare room for a friend."

<p/>Lady Bertram repeated enough of this conversation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband to
convince him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) how much he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had mistaken his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) sister-in-law’s views; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was from that moment perfectly safe from all expectation, or the
slightest allusion to it from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not but wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
refusing to do anything for a niece whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been so forward to
adopt; but, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took early care to make him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), as well as Lady
Bertram, understand that whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) possessed was designed for their
family, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) soon grew reconciled to a distinction which, at the same
time that it was advantageous and complimentary to them, would enable
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) better to provide for Fanny himself.

<p/>Fanny soon learnt how unnecessary had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fears of a removal; and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spontaneous, untaught felicity on the discovery, conveyed some
consolation to Edmund for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) disappointment in what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had expected to
be so essentially serviceable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Mrs. Norris took possession of
the White House, the Grants arrived at the Parsonage, and these events
over, everything at Mansfield went on for some time as usual.

<p/>The Grants showing a disposition to be friendly and sociable, gave
great satisfaction in the main among their new acquaintance. They had
their faults, and Mrs. Norris soon found them out. The Doctor was very
fond of eating, and would have a good dinner every day; and Mrs. Grant,
instead of contriving to gratify him (<font color='blue'><b>Doctor</b></font>) at little expense, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) cook
as high wages as they did at Mansfield Park, and was scarcely ever seen
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) offices. Mrs. Norris could not speak with any temper of such
grievances, nor of the quantity of butter and eggs that were regularly
consumed in the house. "Nobody loved plenty and hospitality more than
herself; nobody more hated pitiful doings; the Parsonage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) believed,
had never been wanting in comforts of any sort, had never borne a bad
character in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ _time_, but this was a way of going on that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
could not understand. A fine lady in a country parsonage was quite out
of place. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)_ store-room, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought, might have been good enough
for Mrs. Grant to go into. Inquire where she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) would, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could not find
out that Mrs. Grant had ever had more than five thousand pounds."

<p/>Lady Bertram listened without much interest to this sort of invective.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could not enter into the wrongs of an economist, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) felt all
the injuries of beauty in Mrs. Grant’s being so well settled in life
without being handsome, and expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) astonishment on that point
almost as often, though not so diffusely, as Mrs. Norris discussed the
other.

<p/>These opinions had been hardly canvassed a year before another event
arose of such importance in the family, as might fairly claim some
place in the thoughts and conversation of the ladies. Sir Thomas found
it expedient to go to Antigua himself, for the better arrangement of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) affairs, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eldest son with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), in the hope of
detaching him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) from some bad connexions at home. They left England with
the probability of being nearly a twelvemonth absent.

<p/>The necessity of the measure in a pecuniary light, and the hope of its
utility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son, reconciled Sir Thomas to the effort of quitting the
rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, and of leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters to the direction of
others at their present most interesting time of life. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not
think Lady Bertram quite equal to supply his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) place with them, or
rather, to perform what should have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own; but, in Mrs. Norris’s
watchful attention, and in Edmund’s judgment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had sufficient
confidence to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) go without fears for their conduct.

<p/>Lady Bertram did not at all like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was not disturbed by any alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) safety, or solicitude for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
comfort, being one of those persons who think nothing can be dangerous,
or difficult, or fatiguing to anybody but themselves.

<p/>The Miss Bertrams were much to be pitied on the occasion: not for their
sorrow, but for their want of it. Their father was no object of love to
them; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never seemed the friend of their pleasures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
absence was unhappily most welcome. They were relieved by it from all
restraint; and without aiming at one gratification that would probably
have been forbidden by Sir Thomas, they felt themselves immediately at
their own disposal, and to have every indulgence within their reach.
Fanny’s relief, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) consciousness of it, were quite equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cousins’; but a more tender nature suggested that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings were
ungrateful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) really grieved because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not grieve. "Sir
Thomas, who had done so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brothers, and who was gone
perhaps never to return! that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should see him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) go without a tear! it
was a shameful insensibility.<div class="bookquote">" He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), moreover, on the
very last morning, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might see William again in the
course of the ensuing winter, and had charged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to write and invite
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to Mansfield as soon as the squadron to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) belonged should be
known to be in England. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>This was so thoughtful and kind!" and would he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
only have smiled upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and called her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">"my dear Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>while he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
said it, every former frown or cold address might have been forgotten.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) speech in a way to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in sad mortification,
by adding, <div class="bookquote">"If William does come to Mansfield, I hope you may be able
to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) that the many years which have passed since you parted
have not been spent on your side entirely without improvement; though,
I fear, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must find his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister at sixteen in some respects too much
like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) sister at ten."  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cried bitterly over this reflection when
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncle was gone; and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousins, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with red eyes, set
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) down as a hypocrite.
