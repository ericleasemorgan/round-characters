<p/>There was one point which Anne, on returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) family, would have
been more thankful to ascertain even than Mr Elliot's being in love
with Elizabeth, which was, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's not being in love with Mrs
Clay; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was very far from easy about it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had been at
home a few hours.  On going down to breakfast the next morning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
found there had just been a decent pretence on the lady's side of
meaning to leave them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could imagine Mrs Clay to have said, that
"now Miss Anne was come, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not suppose herself at all wanted;"
for Elizabeth was replying in a sort of whisper, <div class="bookquote">"That must not be any
reason, indeed.  I assure you I feel it none.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is nothing to me,
compared with you;"   (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in full time to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father say,
"My dear madam, this must not be.  As yet, you have seen nothing of
Bath.  You have been here only to be useful.  You must not run away
from us now.  You must stay to be acquainted with Mrs Wallis, the
beautiful Mrs Wallis.  To your fine mind, I well know the sight of
beauty is a real gratification."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke and looked so much in earnest, that Anne was not surprised to
see Mrs Clay stealing a glance at Elizabeth and herself.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
countenance, perhaps, might express some watchfulness; but the praise
of the fine mind did not appear to excite a thought in her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) sister.  The
lady could not but yield to such joint entreaties, and promise to stay.

<p/>In the course of the same morning, Anne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father chancing to be
alone together, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) improved looks; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) "less thin in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) person, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks; her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
complexion, greatly improved; clearer, fresher.  Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) been using any
thing in particular?"  "No, nothing."  <div class="bookquote">"Merely Gowland,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) supposed.
"No, nothing at all."  <div class="bookquote">"Ha! he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was surprised at that;"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and added,
"certainly you cannot do better than to continue as you are; you cannot
be better than well; or I should recommend Gowland, the constant use of
Gowland, during the spring months.  Mrs Clay has been using it at my
recommendation, and you see what it has done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>).  You see how it
has carried away her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) freckles."

<p/>If Elizabeth could but have heard this!  Such personal praise might
have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), especially as it did not appear to Anne that the
freckles were at all lessened.  But everything must take its chance.
The evil of a marriage would be much diminished, if Elizabeth were also
to marry.  As for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might always command a home with Lady
Russell.

<p/>Lady Russell's composed mind and polite manners were put to some trial
on this point, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) intercourse in Camden Place.  The sight of Mrs
Clay in such favour, and of Anne so overlooked, was a perpetual
provocation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) there; and vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as much when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was away, as a
person in Bath who drinks the water, gets all the new publications, and
has a very large acquaintance, has time to be vexed.

<p/>As Mr Elliot became known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) grew more charitable, or more
indifferent, towards the others.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) manners were an immediate
recommendation; and on conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found the solid so fully
supporting the superficial, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was at first, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) told Anne,
almost ready to exclaim, <div class="bookquote">"Can this be Mr Elliot?"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>and could not
seriously picture to herself a more agreeable or estimable man.
Everything united in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); good understanding, correct opinions,
knowledge of the world, and a warm heart.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had strong feelings of
family attachment and family honour, without pride or weakness; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lived with the liberality of a man of fortune, without display; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
judged for himself in everything essential, without defying public
opinion in any point of worldly decorum.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was steady, observant,
moderate, candid; never run away with by spirits or by selfishness,
which fancied itself strong feeling; and yet, with a sensibility to
what was amiable and lovely, and a value for all the felicities of
domestic life, which characters of fancied enthusiasm and violent
agitation seldom really possess.  She (<font color='blue'><b>himself</b></font>) was sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not been
happy in marriage.  Colonel Wallis said it, and Lady Russell saw it;
but it had been no unhappiness to sour his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) mind, nor (she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) began pretty
soon to suspect) to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinking of a second choice.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
satisfaction in Mr Elliot outweighed all the plague of Mrs Clay.

<p/>It was now some years since Anne had begun to learn that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
excellent friend could sometimes think differently; and it did not
surprise her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), therefore, that Lady Russell should see nothing
suspicious or inconsistent, nothing to require more motives than
appeared, in Mr Elliot's great desire of a reconciliation.  In Lady
Russell's view, it was perfectly natural that Mr Elliot, at a mature
time of life, should feel it a most desirable object, and what would
very generally recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) among all sensible people, to be on good
terms with the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) family; the simplest process in the world of
time upon a head naturally clear, and only erring in the heyday of
youth.  Anne presumed, however, still to smile about it, and at last to
mention <div class="bookquote">"Elizabeth."   (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>Lady Russell listened, and looked, and made only
this cautious reply:--"Elizabeth! very well; time will explain."

<p/>It was a reference to the future, which Anne, after a little
observation, felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must submit to.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could determine nothing at
present.  In that house Elizabeth must be first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in the
habit of such general observance as <div class="bookquote">"Miss Elliot,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>that any
particularity of attention seemed almost impossible.  Mr Elliot, too,
it must be remembered, had not been a widower seven months.  A little
delay on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side might be very excusable.  In fact, Anne could never
see the crape round his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hat, without fearing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the
inexcusable one, in attributing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) such imaginations; for though
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) marriage had not been very happy, still it had existed so many
years that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not comprehend a very rapid recovery from the
awful impression of its being dissolved.

<p/>However it might end, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was without any question their pleasantest
acquaintance in Bath:  she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nobody equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and it was a great
indulgence now and then to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) about Lyme, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) seemed to
have as lively a wish to see again, and to see more of, as herself.
They went through the particulars of their first meeting a great many
times.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with some
earnestness.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew it well; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remembered another person's
look also.

<p/>They did not always think alike.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) value for rank and connexion she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
perceived was greater than hers.  It was not merely complaisance, it
must be a liking to the cause, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) enter warmly into her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father and sister's solicitudes on a subject which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought unworthy
to excite them.  The Bath paper one morning announced the arrival of
the Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) daughter, the Honourable
Miss Carteret; and all the comfort of No. --, Camden Place, was swept
away for many days; for the Dalrymples (in Anne's opinion, most
unfortunately) were cousins of the Elliots; and the agony was how to
introduce themselves properly.

<p/>Anne had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister before in contact with
nobility, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must acknowledge herself disappointed.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hoped
better things from their high ideas of their own situation in life, and
was reduced to form a wish which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never foreseen; a wish that
they had more pride; for "our cousins Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret;" <div class="bookquote">"our cousins, the Dalrymples,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>sounded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) ears all day
long.

<p/>Sir Walter had once been in company with the late viscount, but had
never seen any of the rest of the family; and the difficulties of the
case arose from there having been a suspension of all intercourse by
letters of ceremony, ever since the death of that said late viscount,
when, in consequence of a dangerous illness of Sir Walter's at the same
time, there had been an unlucky omission at Kellynch.  No letter of
condolence had been sent to Ireland.  The neglect had been visited on
the head of the sinner; for when poor Lady Elliot died herself, no
letter of condolence was received at Kellynch, and, consequently, there
was but too much reason to apprehend that the Dalrymples considered the
relationship as closed.  How to have this anxious business set to
rights, and be admitted as cousins again, was the question:  and it was
a question which, in a more rational manner, neither Lady Russell nor
Mr Elliot thought unimportant.  "Family connexions were always worth
preserving, good company always worth seeking; Lady Dalrymple had taken
a house, for three months, in Laura Place, and would be living in
style.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Laura</b></font>) had been at Bath the year before, and Lady Russell had
heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) spoken of as a charming woman.  It was very desirable that
the connexion should be renewed, if it could be done, without any
compromise of propriety on the side of the Elliots."

<p/>Sir Walter, however, would choose his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own means, and at last wrote a
very fine letter of ample explanation, regret, and entreaty, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
right honourable cousin.  Neither Lady Russell nor Mr Elliot could
admire the letter; but it did all that was wanted, in bringing three
lines of scrawl from the Dowager Viscountess.  <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was very much
honoured, and should be happy in their acquaintance."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The toils of the
business were over, the sweets began.  They visited in Laura Place,
they had the cards of Dowager Viscountess Dalrymple, and the Honourable
Miss Carteret, to be arranged wherever they might be most visible:  and
<div class="bookquote">"Our cousins in Laura Place," (<font color='red'><b>Miss Carteret</b></font>)</div>--<div class="bookquote">"Our cousin, Lady Dalrymple and Miss
Carteret,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Carteret</b></font>)</div>were talked of to everybody.

<p/>Anne was ashamed.  Had Lady Dalrymple and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) daughter even been very
agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) would still have been ashamed of the agitation they
created, but they were nothing.  There was no superiority of manner,
accomplishment, or understanding.  Lady Dalrymple had acquired the name
of <div class="bookquote">"a charming woman,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>because she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) had a smile and a civil answer for
everybody.  Miss Carteret, with still less to say, was so plain and so
awkward, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) would never have been tolerated in Camden Place but
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) birth.

<p/>Lady Russell confessed she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had expected something better; but yet <div class="bookquote">"it
was an acquaintance worth having;"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and when Anne ventured to speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
opinion of them to Mr Elliot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) agreed to their being nothing in
themselves, but still maintained that, as a family connexion, as good
company, as those who would collect good company around them, they had
their value.  Anne smiled and said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My idea of good company, Mr Elliot, is the company of clever,
well-informed people, who have a great deal of conversation; that is
what I call good company."

 (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"You are mistaken,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gently, "that is not good company; that is
the best.  Good company requires only birth, education, and manners,
and with regard to education is not very nice.  Birth and good manners
are essential; but a little learning is by no means a dangerous thing
in good company; on the contrary, it will do very well.  My cousin Anne
shakes her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is not satisfied.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is fastidious.  My dear
cousin" (sitting down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)), "you have a better right to be
fastidious than almost any other woman I know; but will it answer?
Will it make you happy?  Will it not be wiser to accept the society of
those good ladies in Laura Place, and enjoy all the advantages of the
connexion as far as possible?  You may depend upon it, that they will
move in the first set in Bath this winter, and as rank is rank, your
being known to be related to them will have its use in fixing your
family (our family let me say) in that degree of consideration which we
must all wish for."

<p/>"Yes," sighed Anne, "we shall, indeed, be known to be related to them!"
then recollecting herself, and not wishing to be answered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) added,
<div class="bookquote">"I certainly do think there has been by far too much trouble taken to
procure the acquaintance.  I suppose"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>(smiling) "I have more pride than
any of you; but I confess it does vex me, that we should be so
solicitous to have the relationship acknowledged, which we may be very
sure is a matter of perfect indifference to them."

<p/>"Pardon me, dear cousin, you are unjust in your own claims.  In London,
perhaps, in your present quiet style of living, it might be as you say:
but in Bath; Sir Walter Elliot and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) family will always be worth
knowing:  always acceptable as acquaintance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "I certainly am proud, too proud to enjoy a welcome
which depends so entirely upon place."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I love your indignation,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"it is very natural.  But here you
are in Bath, and the object is to be established here with all the
credit and dignity which ought to belong to Sir Walter Elliot.  You
talk of being proud; I am called proud, I know, and I shall not wish to
believe myself otherwise; for our pride, if investigated, would have
the same object, I have no doubt, though the kind may seem a little
different.  In one point, I am sure, my dear cousin,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>(he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) continued,
speaking lower, though there was no one else in the room) "in one
point, I am sure, we must feel alike.  We must feel that every addition
to your father's society, among his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) equals or superiors, may be of use
in diverting his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thoughts from those who are beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked, as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spoke, to the seat which Mrs Clay had been lately
occupying:  a sufficient explanation of what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) particularly meant; and
though Anne could not believe in their having the same sort of pride,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was pleased with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for not liking Mrs Clay; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) conscience
admitted that his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishing to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) father's getting great
acquaintance was more than excusable in the view of defeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>).
