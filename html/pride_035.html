<p/>Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and
meditations which had at length closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not
yet recover from the surprise of what had happened; it was
impossible to think of anything else; and, totally indisposed for
employment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resolved, soon after breakfast, to indulge
herself in air and exercise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was proceeding directly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s sometimes
coming there stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and instead of entering the park, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
turned up the lane, which led farther from the turnpike-road. The
park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon
passed one of the gates into the ground.

<p/>After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the
gates and look into the park. The five weeks which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had now
passed in Kent had made a great difference in the country, and
every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
on the point of continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walk, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) caught a glimpse of
a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was
moving that way; and, fearful of its being Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
directly retreating. But the person who advanced was now near
enough to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and stepping forward with eagerness,
pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) name. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had turned away; but on hearing herself
called, though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
moved again towards the gate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had by that time reached it
also, and, holding out a letter, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) instinctively took,
said, with a look of haughty composure, "I have been walking in
the grove some time in the hope of meeting you. Will you do me
the honour of reading that letter?" And then, with a slight bow,
turned again into the plantation, and was soon out of sight.

<p/>With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest
curiosity, Elizabeth opened the letter, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still
increasing wonder, perceived an envelope containing two sheets of
letter-paper, written quite through, in a very close hand. The
envelope itself was likewise full. Pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way along the
lane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then began it. It was dated from Rosings, at eight
o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:—

<p/>"Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the
apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments
or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to
you. I write without any intention of paining you, or humbling
myself, by dwelling on wishes which, for the happiness of both,
cannot be too soon forgotten; and the effort which the formation
and the perusal of this letter must occasion, should have been
spared, had not my character required it to be written and read.
You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand your
attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but
I demand it of your justice.

<p/>"Two offenses of a very different nature, and by no means of
equal magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first
mentioned was, that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I
had detached Mr. Bingley from your sister, and the other, that I
had, in defiance of various claims, in defiance of honour and
humanity, ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the
prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and wantonly to have thrown
off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged favourite of my
father, a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on
our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect its
exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two
young persons, whose affection could be the growth of only a few
weeks, could bear no comparison. But from the severity of that
blame which was last night so liberally bestowed, respecting each
circumstance, I shall hope to be in the future secured, when the
following account of my actions and their motives has been read.
If, in the explanation of them, which is due to myself, I am
under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive
to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must be
obeyed, and further apology would be absurd.

<p/>"I had not been long in Hertfordshire, before I saw, in common
with others, that Bingley preferred your elder sister to any
other young woman in the country. But it was not till the evening
of the dance at Netherfield that I had any apprehension of his (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>)
feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him (<font color='blue'><b>others</b></font>) in love
before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with you,
I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental
information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given
rise to a general expectation of their marriage. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) spoke of it
as a certain event, of which the time alone could be undecided.
From that moment I observed my friend’s behaviour attentively;
and I could then perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) partiality for Miss Bennet was
beyond what I had ever witnessed in him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). Your sister I also
watched. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) look and manners were open, cheerful, and engaging
as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar regard, and I
remained convinced from the evening’s scrutiny, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
received his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) attentions with pleasure, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not invite them by
any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken
here, _I_ must have been in error. Your superior knowledge of
your sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have
been misled by such error to inflict pain on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), your resentment
has not been unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert,
that the serenity of your sister’s countenance and air was such
as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that,
however amiable her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) temper, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) heart was not likely to be easily
touched. That I was desirous of believing her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) indifferent is
certain—but I will venture to say that my investigation and
decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears. I did
not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to be indifferent because I wished it; I believed
it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason. My
objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last
night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion
to put aside, in my own case; the want of connection could not be
so great an evil to my friend as to me. But there were other
causes of repugnance; causes which, though still existing, and
existing to an equal degree in both instances, I had myself
endeavoured to forget, because they were not immediately before
me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The situation of
your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in
comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently, so
almost uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger
sisters, and occasionally even by your father. Pardon me. It
pains me to offend you. But amidst your concern for the defects
of your nearest relations, and your displeasure at this
representation of them, let it give you consolation to consider
that, to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of
the like censure, is praise no less generally bestowed on you and
your elder sister, than it is honourable to the sense and
disposition of both. I will only say farther that from what
passed that evening, my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and
every inducement heightened which could have led me before, to
preserve my friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy
connection. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) left Netherfield for London, on the day following,
as you, I am certain, remember, with the design of soon
returning.

<p/>"The part which I acted is now to be explained. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sisters’
uneasiness had been equally excited with my own; our coincidence
of feeling was soon discovered, and, alike sensible that no time
was to be lost in detaching their brother, we shortly resolved on
joining him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) directly in London. We accordingly went—and there I
readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the
certain evils of such a choice. I described, and enforced them
earnestly. But, however this remonstrance might have staggered or
delayed his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) determination, I do not suppose that it would
ultimately have prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded
by the assurance that I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s
indifference. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had before believed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to return his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) affection
with sincere, if not with equal regard. But Bingley has great
natural modesty, with a stronger dependence on my judgement than
on his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own. To convince him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had deceived
himself, was no very difficult point. To persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) against
returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been
given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself
for having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct in
the whole affair on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it
is that I condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to
conceal from him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself,
as it was known to Miss Bingley; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother is even yet
ignorant of it. That they might have met without ill consequence
is perhaps probable; but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) regard did not appear to me enough
extinguished for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) without some danger. Perhaps this
concealment, this disguise was beneath me; it is done, however,
and it was done for the best. On this subject I have nothing more
to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your
sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done and though the motives
which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient,
I have not yet learnt to condemn them.

<p/>"With respect to that other, more weighty accusation, of having
injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by laying before you
the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) connection with my family. Of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has
_particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what
I shall relate, I can summon more than one witness of undoubted
veracity.

<p/>"Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for
many years the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose
good conduct in the discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) trust naturally inclined my
father to be of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); and on George Wickham, who was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) godson, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) kindness was therefore liberally bestowed. My
father supported him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) at school, and afterwards at Cambridge—most
important assistance, as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own father, always poor from the
extravagance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife, would have been unable to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a
gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this young
man’s society, whose manners were always engaging; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had also
the highest opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and hoping the church would be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
profession, intended to provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in it. As for myself, it
is many, many years since I first began to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a very
different manner. The vicious propensities—the want of principle,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was careful to guard from the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) best
friend, could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly
the same age with himself, and who had opportunities of seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy could not have. Here
again I shall give you pain—to what degree you only can tell. But
whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has created, a
suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
real character—it adds even another motive.

<p/>"My excellent father died about five years ago; and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the last so steady, that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
will he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) particularly recommended it to me, to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
advancement in the best manner that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) profession might
allow—and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) took orders, desired that a valuable family
living might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) as soon as it became vacant. There was also a
legacy of one thousand pounds. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own father did not long
survive mine, and within half a year from these events, Mr.
Wickham wrote to inform me that, having finally resolved against
taking orders, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hoped I should not think it unreasonable for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage, in lieu of
the preferment, by which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could not be benefited. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had some
intention, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, of studying law, and I must be aware that
the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient
support therein. I rather wished, than believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to be
sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman;
the business was therefore soon settled—he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) resigned all claim to
assistance in the church, were it possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could ever be
in a situation to receive it, and accepted in return three
thousand pounds. All connection between us seemed now dissolved.
I thought too ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to Pemberley, or admit his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
society in town. In town I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) chiefly lived, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
studying the law was a mere pretence, and being now free from all
restraint, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) life was a life of idleness and dissipation. For
about three years I heard little of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); but on the decease of
the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>)
applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>)
circumstances, he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) assured me, and I had no difficulty in
believing it, were exceedingly bad. He (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) had found the law a most
unprofitable study, and was now absolutely resolved on being
ordained, if I would present him (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) to the living in question—of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) trusted there could be little doubt, as he (<font color='blue'><b>incumbent</b></font>) was well
assured that I had no other person to provide for, and I could
not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will
hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for
resisting every repetition to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) resentment was in
proportion to the distress of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) circumstances—and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
doubtless as violent in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) abuse of me to others as in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
reproaches to myself. After this period every appearance of
acquaintance was dropped. How he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lived I know not. But last
summer he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was again most painfully obtruded on my notice.

<p/>"I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget
myself, and which no obligation less than the present should
induce me to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I
feel no doubt of your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten
years my junior, was left to the guardianship of my mother’s
nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and myself. About a year ago, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
was taken from school, and an establishment formed for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) in
London; and last summer she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) went with the lady who presided over
it, to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr. Wickham, undoubtedly
by design; for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance
between him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were most
unhappily deceived; and by her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) connivance and aid, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) so far
recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart
retained a strong impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) kindness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) as a child,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was persuaded to believe herself in love, and to consent
to an elopement. She (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) was then but fifteen, which must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
excuse; and after stating her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) imprudence, I am happy to add, that
I owed the knowledge of it to herself. I joined them unexpectedly
a day or two before the intended elopement, and then Georgiana,
unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) almost looked up to as a father, acknowledged the whole
to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I acted. Regard for my
sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public exposure; but I
wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately, and Mrs.
Younge was of course removed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) charge. Mr. Wickham’s chief
object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty
thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of
revenging himself on me was a strong inducement. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) revenge
would have been complete indeed.

<p/>"This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in which we
have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely reject
it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty
towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form
of falsehood he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had imposed on you; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) success is not
perhaps to be wondered at. Ignorant as you previously were of
everything concerning either, detection could not be in your
power, and suspicion certainly not in your inclination.

<p/>"You may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last
night; but I was not then master enough of myself to know what
could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here
related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant
intimacy, and, still more, as one of the executors of my father’s
will, has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of
these transactions. If your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_
assertions valueless, you cannot be prevented by the same cause
from confiding in my cousin; and that there may be the
possibility of consulting him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), I shall endeavour to find some
opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of
the morning. I will only add, God bless you.
