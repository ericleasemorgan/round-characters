<p/>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
letter as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) possibly could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was no sooner in
possession of it than, hurrying into the little copse, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was least likely to be interrupted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat down on one of the
benches and prepared to be happy; for the length of the letter
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that it did not contain a denial.

<p/>"Gracechurch Street, _Sept_. 6.

<p/>"My dear Niece,

<p/>"I have just received your letter, and shall devote this whole
morning to answering it, as I foresee that a _little_ writing
will not comprise what I have to tell you. I must confess myself
surprised by your application; I did not expect it from _you_.
Don’t think me angry, however, for I only mean to let you know
that I had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on _your_
side. If you do not choose to understand me, forgive my
impertinence. Your uncle is as much surprised as I am—and nothing
but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to act as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has done. But if you are really innocent and
ignorant, I must be more explicit.

<p/>"On the very day of my coming home from Longbourn, your uncle had
a most unexpected visitor. Mr. Darcy called, and was shut up with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) several hours. It was all over before I arrived; so my
curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as _yours_ seems to have
been. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came to tell Mr. Gardiner that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had found out where
your sister and Mr. Wickham were, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had seen and talked
with them both; Wickham repeatedly, Lydia once. From what I can
collect, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) left Derbyshire only one day after ourselves, and
came to town with the resolution of hunting for them. The motive
professed was his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) conviction of its being owing to himself that
Wickham’s worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it
impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) generously imputed the whole to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mistaken pride, and
confessed that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had before thought it beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) to lay his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
private actions open to the world. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) character was to speak for
itself. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) called it, therefore, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) duty to step forward, and
endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself.
If he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) _had another_ motive, I am sure it would never disgrace
him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been some days in town, before he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was able to
discover them; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had something to direct his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) search, which
was more than _we_ had; and the consciousness of this was another
reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) resolving to follow us.

<p/>"There is a lady, it seems, a Mrs. Younge, who was some time ago
governess to Miss Darcy, and was dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) charge on
some cause of disapprobation, though he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) did not say what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
then took a large house in Edward-street, and has since
maintained herself by letting lodgings. This Mrs. Younge was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
knew, intimately acquainted with Wickham; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) for
intelligence of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) got to town. But it was two or
three days before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could get from her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wanted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) would
not betray her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) trust, I suppose, without bribery and corruption,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) really did know where her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) friend was to be found. Wickham
indeed had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) on their first arrival in London, and had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) been able to receive them into her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>) house, they would have
taken up their abode with her (<font color='blue'><b>Younge</b></font>). At length, however, our kind
friend procured the wished-for direction. They were in —— street.
He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw Wickham, and afterwards insisted on seeing Lydia. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
first object with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) acknowledged, had been to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) present disgraceful situation, and return to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>),
offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) assistance, as far as it would go. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) found
Lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cared
for none of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) friends; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wanted no help of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would not
hear of leaving Wickham. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was sure they should be married some
time or other, and it did not much signify when. Since such were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) feelings, it only remained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) thought, to secure and
expedite a marriage, which, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) very first conversation with
Wickham, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) easily learnt had never been _his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_ design. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment, on account of
some debts of honour, which were very pressing; and scrupled not
to lay all the ill-consequences of Lydia’s flight on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own
folly alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) meant to resign his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) commission immediately; and
as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) future situation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could conjecture very little about
it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must go somewhere, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) did not know where, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) should have nothing to live on.

<p/>"Mr. Darcy asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) why he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not married your sister at once.
Though Mr. Bennet was not imagined to be very rich, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would have
been able to do something for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) situation must have
been benefited by marriage. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) found, in reply to this
question, that Wickham still cherished the hope of more
effectually making his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) fortune by marriage in some other country.
Under such circumstances, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was not likely to be proof
against the temptation of immediate relief.

<p/>"They met several times, for there was much to be discussed.
Wickham of course wanted more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could get; but at length
was reduced to be reasonable.

<p/>"Everything being settled between _them_, Mr. Darcy’s next step
was to make your uncle acquainted with it, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) first called in
Gracechurch street the evening before I came home. But Mr.
Gardiner could not be seen, and Mr. Darcy found, on further
enquiry, that your father was still with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), but would quit town
the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not judge your father to be a person
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could so properly consult as your uncle, and therefore
readily postponed seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) till after the departure of the
former. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not leave his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) name, and till the next day it was
only known that a gentleman had called on business.

<p/>"On Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came again. Your father was gone, your uncle at
home, and, as I said before, they had a great deal of talk
together.

<p/>"They met again on Sunday, and then _I_ saw him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) too. It was not
all settled before Monday: as soon as it was, the express was
sent off to Longbourn. But our visitor was very obstinate. I
fancy, Lizzy, that obstinacy is the real defect of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) character,
after all. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) has been accused of many faults at different times,
but _this_ is the true one. Nothing was to be done that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did
not do himself; though I am sure (and I do not speak it to be
thanked, therefore say nothing about it), your uncle would most
readily have settled the whole.

<p/>"They battled it together for a long time, which was more than
either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved. But at
last your uncle was forced to yield, and instead of being allowed
to be of use to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) niece, was forced to put up with only having
the probable credit of it, which went sorely against the grain;
and I really believe your letter this morning gave him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) great
pleasure, because it required an explanation that would rob him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) borrowed feathers, and give the praise where it was due.
But, Lizzy, this must go no farther than yourself, or Jane at
most.

<p/>"You know pretty well, I suppose, what has been done for the
young people. His (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) debts are to be paid, amounting, I believe, to
considerably more than a thousand pounds, another thousand in
addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own settled upon _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_, and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) commission
purchased. The reason why all this was to be done by him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) alone,
was such as I have given above. It was owing to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
reserve and want of proper consideration, that Wickham’s
character had been so misunderstood, and consequently that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had
been received and noticed as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was. Perhaps there was some truth
in _this_; though I doubt whether _his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)_ reserve, or _anybody’s_
reserve, can be answerable for the event. But in spite of all
this fine talking, my dear Lizzy, you may rest perfectly assured
that your uncle would never have yielded, if we had not given him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
credit for _another interest_ in the affair.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When all this was resolved on, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) returned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) friends,
who were still staying at Pemberley; but it was agreed that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
should be in London once more when the wedding took place, and
all money matters were then to receive the last finish.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I believe I have now told you every thing. It is a relation
which you tell me is to give you great surprise; I hope at least
it will not afford you any displeasure. Lydia came to us; and
Wickham had constant admission to the house. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_ was exactly
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had been, when I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in Hertfordshire; but I would
not tell you how little I was satisfied with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ behaviour
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) staid with us, if I had not perceived, by Jane’s letter
last Wednesday, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) conduct on coming home was exactly of a
piece with it, and therefore what I now tell you can give you no
fresh pain. I talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) repeatedly in the most serious
manner, representing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) all the wickedness of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
done, and all the unhappiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had brought on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family. If
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heard me, it was by good luck, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not
listen. I was sometimes quite provoked, but then I recollected my
dear Elizabeth and Jane, and for their sakes had patience with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>"Mr. Darcy was punctual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) return, and as Lydia informed you,
attended the wedding. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dined with us the next day, and was to
leave town again on Wednesday or Thursday. Will you be very angry
with me, my dear Lizzy, if I take this opportunity of saying
(what I was never bold enough to say before) how much I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).
His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to us has, in every respect, been as pleasing as
when we were in Derbyshire. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) understanding and opinions all
please me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wants nothing but a little more liveliness, and
_that_, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) marry _prudently_, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wife may teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I
thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) very sly;—he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) hardly ever mentioned your name. But
slyness seems the fashion.

<p/>"Pray forgive me if I have been very presuming, or at least do
not punish me so far as to exclude me from P. I shall never be
quite happy till I have been all round the park. A low phaeton,
with a nice little pair of ponies, would be the very thing.

<p/>"But I must write no more. The children have been wanting me this
half hour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yours, very sincerely,
" (<font color='red'><b>M.</b></font>)</div>M. GARDINER."

<p/>The contents of this letter threw Elizabeth into a flutter of
spirits, in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure
or pain bore the greatest share. The vague and unsettled
suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what Mr. Darcy might
have been doing to forward her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s match, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be
probable, and at the same time dreaded to be just, from the pain
of obligation, were proved beyond their greatest extent to be
true! He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had followed them purposely to town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had taken on
himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a
research; in which supplication had been necessary to a woman
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must abominate and despise, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was reduced to
meet, frequently meet, reason with, persuade, and finally bribe,
the man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) always most wished to avoid, and whose very name
it was punishment to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to pronounce. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done all this for a
girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could neither regard nor esteem. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) heart did
whisper that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had done it for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). But it was a hope shortly
checked by other considerations, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) soon felt that even her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
vanity was insufficient, when required to depend on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)—for a woman who had already refused him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)—as able to
overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against
relationship with Wickham. Brother-in-law of Wickham! Every kind
of pride must revolt from the connection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had, to be sure,
done much. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was ashamed to think how much. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had given a
reason for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) interference, which asked no extraordinary stretch
of belief. It was reasonable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) should feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had been
wrong; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had liberality, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had the means of exercising it;
and though she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) would not place herself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) principal
inducement, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could, perhaps, believe that remaining partiality
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) endeavours in a cause where her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) peace of
mind must be materially concerned. It was painful, exceedingly
painful, to know that they were under obligations to a person who
could never receive a return. They owed the restoration of Lydia,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) character, every thing, to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Oh! how heartily did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
grieve over every ungracious sensation she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had ever encouraged,
every saucy speech she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had ever directed towards him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). For herself
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was humbled; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). Proud that in a cause
of compassion and honour, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been able to get the better of
himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) read over her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) aunt’s commendation of him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) again and
again. It was hardly enough; but it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was even
sensible of some pleasure, though mixed with regret, on finding
how steadfastly both she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle had been persuaded that
affection and confidence subsisted between Mr. Darcy and herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was roused from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) seat, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) reflections, by some one’s
approach; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could strike into another path, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was
overtaken by Wickham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid I interrupt your solitary ramble, my dear sister?"
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You certainly do,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) replied with a smile; <div class="bookquote">"but it does not
follow that the interruption must be unwelcome."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"I should be sorry indeed, if it were. _We_ were always good
friends; and now we are better."

<p/>"True. Are the others coming out?"

<p/>"I do not know. Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are going in the carriage
to Meryton. And so, my dear sister, I find, from our uncle and
aunt, that you have actually seen Pemberley.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) replied in the affirmative.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I almost envy you the pleasure, and yet I believe it would be
too much for me, or else I could take it in my way to Newcastle.
And you saw the old housekeeper, I suppose? Poor Reynolds, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)
was always very fond of me. But of course she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did not mention my
name to you."

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) did."

<p/>"And what did she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) say?"

<p/>"That you were gone into the army, and she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) was afraid had—not
turned out well. At such a distance as _that_, you know, things
are strangely misrepresented."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) replied, biting his (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) lips. Elizabeth hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
silenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) soon afterwards said:

<p/>"I was surprised to see Darcy in town last month. We passed each
other several times. I wonder what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can be doing there."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps preparing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) marriage with Miss de Bourgh,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth. "It must be something particular, to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) there at
this time of year."

<p/>"Undoubtedly. Did you see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) while you were at Lambton? I
thought I understood from the Gardiners that you had."

<p/>"Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) introduced us to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister."

<p/>"And do you like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Very much."

<p/>"I have heard, indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is uncommonly improved within
this year or two. When I last saw her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was not very
promising. I am very glad you liked her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will turn out
well."

<p/>"I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has got over the most trying age."

<p/>"Did you go by the village of Kympton?"

<p/>"I do not recollect that we did."

<p/>"I mention it, because it is the living which I ought to have
had. A most delightful place!—Excellent Parsonage House! It would
have suited me in every respect."

<p/>"How should you have liked making sermons?"

<p/>"Exceedingly well. I should have considered it as part of my
duty, and the exertion would soon have been nothing. One ought
not to repine;—but, to be sure, it would have been such a thing
for me! The quiet, the retirement of such a life would have
answered all my ideas of happiness! But it was not to be. Did you
ever hear Darcy mention the circumstance, when you were in Kent?"

<p/>"I _have_ heard from authority, which I thought _as good_, that
it was left you conditionally only, and at the will of the
present patron."

<p/>"You have. Yes, there was something in _that_; I told you so from
the first, you may remember."

<p/>"I _did_ hear, too, that there was a time, when sermon-making was
not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present; that you
actually declared your resolution of never taking orders, and
that the business had been compromised accordingly."

<p/>"You did! and it was not wholly without foundation. You may
remember what I told you on that point, when first we talked of
it."

<p/>They were now almost at the door of the house, for she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had walked
fast to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>); and unwilling, for her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sister’s sake, to
provoke him (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) only said in reply, with a good-humoured smile:

<p/>"Come, Mr. Wickham, we are brother and sister, you know. Do not
let us quarrel about the past. In future, I hope we shall be
always of one mind."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) held out her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hand; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) kissed it with affectionate gallantry,
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hardly knew how to look, and they entered the house.
