<p/>Harriet Smith's intimacy at Hartfield was soon a settled thing. Quick and decided in her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ways, Emma lost no time in inviting, encouraging, and telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to come very often; and as their acquaintance increased, so did their satisfaction in each other. As a walking companion, Emma had very early foreseen how useful she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). In that respect Mrs. Weston's loss had been important. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father never went beyond the shrubbery, where two divisions of the ground sufficed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) long walk, or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) short, as the year varied; and since Mrs. Weston's marriage her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) exercise had been too much confined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had ventured once alone to Randalls, but it was not pleasant; and a Harriet Smith, therefore, one whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could summon at any time to a walk, would be a valuable addition to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) privileges. But in every respect, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) saw more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) approved her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and was confirmed in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) kind designs.

<p/>Harriet certainly was not clever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had a sweet, docile, grateful disposition, was totally free from conceit, and only desiring to be guided by any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked up to. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) early attachment to herself was very amiable; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inclination for good company, and power of appreciating what was elegant and clever, shewed that there was no want of taste, though strength of understanding must not be expected. Altogether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was quite convinced of Harriet Smith's being exactly the young friend she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted exactly the something which her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) home required. Such a friend as Mrs. Weston was out of the question. Two such could never be granted. Two such she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not want. It was quite a different sort of thing, a sentiment distinct and independent. Mrs. Weston was the object of a regard which had its basis in gratitude and esteem. Harriet would be loved as one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be useful. For Mrs. Weston there was nothing to be done; for Harriet every thing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first attempts at usefulness were in an endeavour to find out who were the parents, but Harriet could not tell. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was ready to tell every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) power, but on this subject questions were vain. Emma was obliged to fancy what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never believe that in the same situation she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should not have discovered the truth. Harriet had no penetration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been satisfied to hear and believe just what Mrs. Goddard chose to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and looked no farther.

<p/>Mrs. Goddard, and the teachers, and the girls and the affairs of the school in general, formed naturally a great part of the conversation and but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) acquaintance with the Martins of Abbey-Mill Farm, it must have been the whole. But the Martins occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) thoughts a good deal; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had spent two very happy months with them, and now loved to talk of the pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) visit, and describe the many comforts and wonders of the place. Emma encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talkativeness amused by such a picture of another set of beings, and enjoying the youthful simplicity which could speak with so much exultation of Mrs. Martin's having <div class="bookquote">"two parlours, two very good parlours, indeed; one of them quite as large as Mrs. Goddard's drawing-room; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) having an upper maid who had lived five-and-twenty years with her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and of their having eight cows, two of them Alderneys, and one a little Welch cow, a very pretty little Welch cow indeed; and of Mrs. Martin's saying as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so fond of it, it should be called her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) cow; and of their having a very handsome summer-house in their garden, where some day next year they were all to drink tea: a very handsome summer-house, large enough to hold a dozen people."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Martin</b></font>)</div><p/>For some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was amused, without thinking beyond the immediate cause; but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to understand the family better, other feelings arose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had taken up a wrong idea, fancying it was a mother and daughter, a son and son's wife, who all lived together; but when it appeared that the Mr. Martin, who bore a part in the narrative, and was always mentioned with approbation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) great good-nature in doing something or other, was a single man; that there was no young Mrs. Martin, no wife in the case; she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did suspect danger to her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) poor little friend from all this hospitality and kindness, and that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) were not taken care of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might be required to sink herself forever.

<p/>With this inspiriting notion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) questions increased in number and meaning; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) particularly led Harriet to talk more of Mr. Martin, and there was evidently no dislike to it. Harriet was very ready to speak of the share he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had had in their moonlight walks and merry evening games; and dwelt a good deal upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so very good-humoured and obliging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gone three miles round one day in order to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) some walnuts, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had said how fond she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was of them, and in every thing else he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so very obliging. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) shepherd's son into the parlour one night on purpose to sing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very fond of singing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could sing a little himself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very clever, and understood every thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had a very fine flock, and, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was with them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had been bid more for his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wool than any body in the country. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed every body spoke well of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) mother and sisters were very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). Mrs. Martin had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) one day (and there was a blush as she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said it,) that it was impossible for any body to be a better son, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was sure, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) married, he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would make a good husband. Not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to marry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was in no hurry at all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well done, Mrs. Martin!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>thought Emma. <div class="bookquote">"You know what you are about."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"And when she (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had come away, Mrs. Martin was so very kind as to send Mrs. Goddard a beautiful goose the finest goose Mrs. Goddard had ever seen. Mrs. Goddard had dressed it on a Sunday, and asked all the three teachers, Miss Nash, and Miss Prince, and Miss Richardson, to sup with her (<font color='blue'><b>Richardson</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Martin</b></font>)</div>Mr. Martin, I suppose, is not a man of information beyond the line of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) own business? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does not read?"

<p/>"Oh yes! that is, no I do not know but I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read a good deal but not what you would think any thing of. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads the Agricultural Reports, and some other books that lay in one of the window seats but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) reads all them to himself. But sometimes of an evening, before we went to cards, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would read something aloud out of the Elegant Extracts, very entertaining. And I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has read the Vicar of Wakefield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) never read the Romance of the Forest, nor The Children of the Abbey. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had never heard of such books before I mentioned them, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is determined to get them now as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) can."

<p/>The next question was

<p/>"What sort of looking man is Mr. Martin?"

<p/>"Oh! not handsome not at all handsome. I thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) very plain at first, but I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) so plain now. One does not, you know, after a time. But did you never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)? He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is in Highbury every now and then, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is sure to ride through every week in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) way to Kingston. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has passed you very often."

<p/>"That may be, and I may have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fifty times, but without having any idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) name. A young farmer, whether on horseback or on foot, is the very last sort of person to raise my curiosity. The yeomanry are precisely the order of people with whom I feel I can have nothing to do. A degree or two lower, and a creditable appearance might interest me; I might hope to be useful to their families in some way or other. But a farmer can need none of my help, and is, therefore, in one sense, as much above my notice as in every other he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is below it."

<p/>"To be sure. Oh yes! It is not likely you should ever have observed him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>); but he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) knows you very well indeed I mean by sight."

<p/>"I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) being a very respectable young man. I know, indeed, that he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) is so, and, as such, wish him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) well. What do you imagine his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) age to be?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) was four-and-twenty the 8th of last June, and my birthday is the 23rd just a fortnight and a day's difference which is very odd."

<p/>"Only four-and-twenty. That is too young to settle. His (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) mother is perfectly right not to be in a hurry. They seem very comfortable as they are, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) were to take any pains to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would probably repent it. Six years hence, if he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) could meet with a good sort of young woman in the same rank as his (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) own, with a little money, it might be very desirable."

<p/>"Six years hence! Dear Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>farmer</b></font>) would be thirty years old!"

<p/>"Well, and that is as early as most men can afford to marry, who are not born to an independence. Mr. Martin, I imagine, has his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) fortune entirely to make cannot be at all beforehand with the world. Whatever money he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might come into when his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) father died, whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) share of the family property, it is, I dare say, all afloat, all employed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) stock, and so forth; and though, with diligence and good luck, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) may be rich in time, it is next to impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) should have realised any thing yet."

<p/>"To be sure, so it is. But they live very comfortably. They have no indoors man, else they do not want for any thing; and Mrs. Martin talks of taking a boy another year."

<p/>"I wish you may not get into a scrape, Harriet, whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) does marry; I mean, as to being acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) wife for though his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) sisters, from a superior education, are not to be altogether objected to, it does not follow that he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) might marry any body at all fit for you to notice. The misfortune of your birth ought to make you particularly careful as to your associates. There can be no doubt of your being a gentleman's daughter, and you must support your claim to that station by every thing within your own power, or there will be plenty of people who would take pleasure in degrading you."

<p/>"Yes, to be sure, I suppose there are. But while I visit at Hartfield, and you are so kind to me, Miss Woodhouse, I am not afraid of what any body can do."

<p/>"You understand the force of influence pretty well, Harriet; but I would have you so firmly established in good society, as to be independent even of Hartfield and Miss Woodhouse. I want to see you permanently well connected, and to that end it will be advisable to have as few odd acquaintance as may be; and, therefore, I say that if you should still be in this country when Mr. Martin marries, I wish you may not be drawn in by your intimacy with the sisters, to be acquainted with the wife, who will probably be some mere farmer's daughter, without education."

<p/>"To be sure. Yes. Not that I think Mr. Martin would ever marry any body but what had had some education and been very well brought up. However, I do not mean to set up my opinion against yours and I am sure I shall not wish for the acquaintance of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) wife. I shall always have a great regard for the Miss Martins, especially Elizabeth, and should be very sorry to give them up, for they are quite as well educated as me. But if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) marries a very ignorant, vulgar woman, certainly I had better not visit her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), if I can help it."

<p/>Emma watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) through the fluctuations of this speech, and saw no alarming symptoms of love. The young man had been the first admirer, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) trusted there was no other hold, and that there would be no serious difficulty, on Harriet's side, to oppose any friendly arrangement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own.

<p/>They met Mr. Martin the very next day, as they were walking on the Donwell road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companion. Emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quick eye sufficiently acquainted with Mr. Robert Martin. His (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) appearance was very neat, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) looked like a sensible young man, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) person had no other advantage; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) must lose all the ground he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had gained in Harriet's inclination. Harriet was not insensible of manner; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had voluntarily noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. Mr. Martin looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not know what manner was.

<p/>They remained but a few minutes together, as Miss Woodhouse must not be kept waiting; and Harriet then came running to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with a smiling face, and in a flutter of spirits, which Miss Woodhouse hoped very soon to compose.

<p/>"Only think of our happening to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)! How very odd! It was quite a chance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) had not gone round by Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not think we ever walked this road. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) thought we walked towards Randalls most days. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has not been able to get the Romance of the Forest yet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was so busy the last time he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was at Kingston that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) quite forgot it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) goes again to-morrow. So very odd we should happen to meet! Well, Miss Woodhouse, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) like what you expected? What do you think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)? Do you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) so very plain?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is very plain, undoubtedly remarkably plain: but that is nothing compared with his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) entire want of gentility. I had no right to expect much, and I did not expect much; but I had no idea that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could be so very clownish, so totally without air. I had imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), I confess, a degree or two nearer gentility."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, in a mortified voice, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is not so genteel as real gentlemen."

<p/>"I think, Harriet, since your acquaintance with us, you have been repeatedly in the company of some such very real gentlemen, that you must yourself be struck with the difference in Mr. Martin. At Hartfield, you have had very good specimens of well educated, well bred men. I should be surprized if, after seeing them, you could be in company with Mr. Martin again without perceiving him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to be a very inferior creature and rather wondering at yourself for having ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) at all agreeable before. Do not you begin to feel that now? Were not you struck? I am sure you must have been struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) awkward look and abrupt manner, and the uncouthness of a voice which I heard to be wholly unmodulated as I stood here."

<p/>"Certainly, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is not like Mr. Knightley. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has not such a fine air and way of walking as Mr. Knightley. I see the difference plain enough. But Mr. Knightley is so very fine a man!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley's air is so remarkably good that it is not fair to compare Mr. Martin with him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). You might not see one in a hundred with gentleman so plainly written as in Mr. Knightley. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not the only gentleman you have been lately used to. What say you to Mr. Weston and Mr. Elton? Compare Mr. Martin with either of them. Compare their manner of carrying themselves; of walking; of speaking; of being silent. You must see the difference."

<p/>"Oh yes! there is a great difference. But Mr. Weston is almost an old man. Mr. Weston must be between forty and fifty."

<p/>"Which makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good manners the more valuable. The older a person grows, Harriet, the more important it is that their manners should not be bad; the more glaring and disgusting any loudness, or coarseness, or awkwardness becomes. What is passable in youth is detestable in later age. Mr. Martin is now awkward and abrupt; what will he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) be at Mr. Weston's time of life?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no saying, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>replied Harriet rather solemnly.

<p/>"But there may be pretty good guessing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be a completely gross, vulgar farmer, totally inattentive to appearances, and thinking of nothing but profit and loss."

<p/>"Will he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), indeed? That will be very bad."

<p/>"How much his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business engrosses him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) already is very plain from the circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) forgetting to inquire for the book you recommended. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a great deal too full of the market to think of any thing else which is just as it should be, for a thriving man. What has he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to do with books? And I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will thrive, and be a very rich man in time and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being illiterate and coarse need not disturb us."

<p/>"I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not remember the book" was all Harriet's answer, and spoken with a degree of grave displeasure which Emma thought might be safely left to itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), therefore, said no more for some time. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) next beginning was,

<p/>"In one respect, perhaps, Mr. Elton's manners are superior to Mr. Knightley's or Mr. Weston's. They have more gentleness. They might be more safely held up as a pattern. There is an openness, a quickness, almost a bluntness in Mr. Weston, which every body likes in him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), because there is so much good-humour with it but that would not do to be copied. Neither would Mr. Knightley's downright, decided, commanding sort of manner, though it suits him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very well; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) figure, and look, and situation in life seem to allow it; but if any young man were to set about copying him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would not be sufferable. On the contrary, I think a young man might be very safely recommended to take Mr. Elton as a model. Mr. Elton is good-humoured, cheerful, obliging, and gentle. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seems to me to be grown particularly gentle of late. I do not know whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has any design of ingratiating himself with either of us, Harriet, by additional softness, but it strikes me that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manners are softer than they used to be. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) means any thing, it must be to please you. Did not I tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) said of you the other day?"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) then repeated some warm personal praise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had drawn from Mr. Elton, and now did full justice to; and Harriet blushed and smiled, and said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had always thought Mr. Elton very agreeable.

<p/>Mr. Elton was the very person fixed on by Emma for driving the young farmer out of Harriet's head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought it would be an excellent match; and only too palpably desirable, natural, and probable, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to have much merit in planning it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared it was what every body else must think of and predict. It was not likely, however, that any body should have equalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the date of the plan, as it had entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brain during the very first evening of Harriet's coming to Hartfield. The longer she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) considered it, the greater was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sense of its expediency. Mr. Elton's situation was most suitable, quite the gentleman himself, and without low connexions; at the same time, not of any family that could fairly object to the doubtful birth of Harriet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a comfortable home for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and Emma imagined a very sufficient income; for though the vicarage of Highbury was not large, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was known to have some independent property; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought very highly of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) as a good-humoured, well-meaning, respectable young man, without any deficiency of useful understanding or knowledge of the world.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had already satisfied herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thought Harriet a beautiful girl, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) trusted, with such frequent meetings at Hartfield, was foundation enough on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side; and on Harriet's there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have all the usual weight and efficacy. And he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was reckoned very handsome; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) person much admired in general, though not by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), there being a want of elegance of feature which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not dispense with: but the girl who could be gratified by a Robert Martin's riding about the country to get walnuts for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) might very well be conquered by Mr. Elton's admiration.
