<p/>Miss Bingley’s letter arrived, and put an end to doubt. The very
first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled
in London for the winter, and concluded with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother’s regret
at not having had time to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) respects to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friends in
Hertfordshire before he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) left the country.

<p/>Hope was over, entirely over; and when Jane could attend to the
rest of the letter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) found little, except the professed
affection of the writer, that could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) any comfort. Miss
Darcy’s praise occupied the chief of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) many attractions
were again dwelt on, and Caroline boasted joyfully of their
increasing intimacy, and ventured to predict the accomplishment
of the wishes which had been unfolded in her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) former letter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>)
wrote also with great pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother’s being an inmate
of Mr. Darcy’s house, and mentioned with raptures some plans of
the latter with regard to new furniture.

<p/>Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all
this, heard it in silent indignation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart was divided
between concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, and resentment against all
others. To Caroline’s assertion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother’s being partial to
Miss Darcy she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) paid no credit. That he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was really fond of Jane,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doubted no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had ever done; and much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
always been disposed to like him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not think without
anger, hardly without contempt, on that easiness of temper, that
want of proper resolution, which now made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the slave of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
designing friends, and led him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own happiness
to the caprice of their inclination. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own happiness,
however, been the only sacrifice, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might have been allowed to
sport with it in whatever manner he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thought best, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister’s was involved in it, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) must be sensible
himself. It was a subject, in short, on which reflection would be
long indulged, and must be unavailing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could think of nothing
else; and yet whether Bingley’s regard had really died away, or
were suppressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friends’ interference; whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been
aware of Jane’s attachment, or whether it had escaped his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
observation; whatever were the case, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
must be materially affected by the difference, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister’s
situation remained the same, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) peace equally wounded.

<p/>A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet’s leaving them
together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield
and its master, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not help saying:

<p/>"Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself! She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) can
have no idea of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gives me by her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) continual
reflections on him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). But I will not repine. It cannot last long.
He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) will be forgot, and we shall all be as we were before.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister with incredulous solicitude, but
said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You doubt me," cried Jane, slightly colouring; "indeed, you have
no reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my
acquaintance, but that is all. I have nothing either to hope or
fear, and nothing to reproach him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) with. Thank God! I have not
_that_ pain. A little time, therefore—I shall certainly try to
get the better."

<p/>With a stronger voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon added, "I have this comfort
immediately, that it has not been more than an error of fancy on
my side, and that it has done no harm to anyone but myself."

<p/>"My dear Jane!" exclaimed Elizabeth, "you are too good. Your
sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic; I do not know
what to say to you. I feel as if I had never done you justice, or
loved you as you deserve.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Bennet eagerly disclaimed all extraordinary merit, and threw
back the praise on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister’s warm affection.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>Nay," said Elizabeth, "this is not fair. _You_ wish to think all
the world respectable, and are hurt if I speak ill of anybody.
_I_ only want to think _you_ perfect, and you set yourself
against it. Do not be afraid of my running into any excess, of my
encroaching on your privilege of universal good-will. You need
not. There are few people whom I really love, and still fewer of
whom I think well. The more I see of the world, the more am I
dissatisfied with it; and every day confirms my belief of the
inconsistency of all human characters, and of the little
dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or
sense. I have met with two instances lately, one I will not
mention; the other is Charlotte’s marriage. It is unaccountable!
In every view it is unaccountable!"

<p/>"My dear Lizzy, do not give way to such feelings as these. They
will ruin your happiness. You do not make allowance enough for
difference of situation and temper. Consider Mr. Collins’s
respectability, and Charlotte’s steady, prudent character.
Remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is one of a large family; that as to fortune,
it is a most eligible match; and be ready to believe, for
everybody’s sake, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) may feel something like regard and
esteem for our cousin."

<p/>"To oblige you, I would try to believe almost anything, but no
one else could be benefited by such a belief as this; for were I
persuaded that Charlotte had any regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), I should only
think worse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) understanding than I now do of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) heart. My
dear Jane, Mr. Collins is a conceited, pompous, narrow-minded,
silly man; you know he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, as well as I do; and you must feel, as
well as I do, that the woman who married him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot have a proper
way of thinking. You shall not defend her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), though it is Charlotte
Lucas. You shall not, for the sake of one individual, change the
meaning of principle and integrity, nor endeavour to persuade
yourself or me, that selfishness is prudence, and insensibility
of danger security for happiness."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must think your language too strong in speaking of both,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane; "and I hope you will be convinced of it by seeing
them happy together. But enough of this. You alluded to something
else. You mentioned _two_ instances. I cannot misunderstand you,
but I entreat you, dear Lizzy, not to pain me by thinking _that
person_ to blame, and saying your opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) is sunk. We must
not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured. We must
not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and
circumspect. It is very often nothing but our own vanity that
deceives us. Women fancy admiration means more than it does."

<p/>"And men take care that they should."

<p/>"If it is designedly done, they cannot be justified; but I have
no idea of there being so much design in the world as some
persons imagine."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am far from attributing any part of Mr. Bingley’s conduct to
design,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; "but without scheming to do wrong, or to
make others unhappy, there may be error, and there may be misery.
Thoughtlessness, want of attention to other people’s feelings,
and want of resolution, will do the business."

<p/>"And do you impute it to either of those?"

<p/>"Yes; to the last. But if I go on, I shall displease you by
saying what I think of persons you esteem. Stop me whilst you
can."

<p/>"You persist, then, in supposing his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) sisters influence him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Yes, in conjunction with his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) friend."

<p/>"I cannot believe it. Why should they try to influence him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)? They
can only wish his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) happiness; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is attached to me, no
other woman can secure it."

<p/>"Your first position is false. They may wish many things besides
his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) happiness; they may wish his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) increase of wealth and
consequence; they may wish him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to marry a girl who has all the
importance of money, great connections, and pride."

<p/>"Beyond a doubt, they do wish him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to choose Miss Darcy," replied
Jane; "but this may be from better feelings than you are
supposing. They have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) much longer than they have known
me; no wonder if they love her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) better. But, whatever may be their
own wishes, it is very unlikely they should have opposed their
brother’s. What sister would think herself at liberty to do it,
unless there were something very objectionable? If they believed
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attached to me, they would not try to part us; if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) were so,
they could not succeed. By supposing such an affection, you make
everybody acting unnaturally and wrong, and me most unhappy. Do
not distress me by the idea. I am not ashamed of having been
mistaken—or, at least, it is light, it is nothing in comparison
of what I should feel in thinking ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters. Let
me take it in the best light, in the light in which it may be
understood."

<p/>Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr.
Bingley’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) returning
no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did
not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ever
considering it with less perplexity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) daughter endeavoured to
convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not believe herself, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and
transient liking, which ceased when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) no more; but
though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the same story to repeat every day. Mrs. Bennet’s best
comfort was that Mr. Bingley must be down again in the summer.

<p/>Mr. Bennet treated the matter differently. <div class="bookquote">"So, Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
one day, "your sister is crossed in love, I find. I congratulate
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Next to being married, a girl likes to be crossed a little
in love now and then. It is something to think of, and it gives
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) a sort of distinction among her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) companions. When is your turn
to come? You will hardly bear to be long outdone by Jane. Now is
your time. Here are officers enough in Meryton to disappoint all
the young ladies in the country. Let Wickham be your man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is a
pleasant fellow, and would jilt you creditably."

<p/>"Thank you, sir, but a less agreeable man would satisfy me. We
must not all expect Jane’s good fortune."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"True,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, "but it is a comfort to think that
whatever of that kind may befall you, you have an affectionate
mother who will make the most of it."

<p/>Mr. Wickham’s society was of material service in dispelling the
gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of
the Longbourn family. They saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) often, and to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) other
recommendations was now added that of general unreserve. The
whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) claims on Mr.
Darcy, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had suffered from him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), was now openly
acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to
know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had
known anything of the matter.

<p/>Miss Bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might
be any extenuating circumstances in the case, unknown to the
society of Hertfordshire; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) mild and steady candour always
pleaded for allowances, and urged the possibility of mistakes—but
by everybody else Mr. Darcy was condemned as the worst of men.
