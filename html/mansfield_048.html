<p/>It had been a miserable party, each of the three believing themselves
most miserable. Mrs. Norris, however, as most attached to Maria, was
really the greatest sufferer. Maria was her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) first favourite, the
dearest of all; the match had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) own contriving, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been
wont with such pride of heart to feel and say, and this conclusion of
it almost overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was an altered creature, quieted, stupefied, indifferent to
everything that passed. The being left with her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister and nephew, and
all the house under her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) care, had been an advantage entirely thrown
away; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been unable to direct or dictate, or even fancy herself
useful. When really touched by affliction, her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) active powers had been
all benumbed; and neither Lady Bertram nor Tom had received from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
the smallest support or attempt at support. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had done no more for
them than they had done for each other. They had been all solitary,
helpless, and forlorn alike; and now the arrival of the others only
established her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) superiority in wretchedness. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) companions were
relieved, but there was no good for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_. Edmund was almost as welcome
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother as Fanny to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt; but Mrs. Norris, instead of having
comfort from either, was but the more irritated by the sight of the
person whom, in the blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) anger, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could have charged as
the daemon of the piece. Had Fanny accepted Mr. Crawford this could not
have happened.

<p/>Susan too was a grievance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had not spirits to notice her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) in more
than a few repulsive looks, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) as a spy, and an intruder,
and an indigent niece, and everything most odious. By her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) other aunt,
Susan was received with quiet kindness. Lady Bertram could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
much time, or many words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), as Fanny’s sister, to have
a claim at Mansfield, and was ready to kiss and like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and Susan was
more than satisfied, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) came perfectly aware that nothing but
ill-humour was to be expected from aunt Norris; and was so provided
with happiness, so strong in that best of blessings, an escape from
many certain evils, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could have stood against a great deal more
indifference than she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) met with from the others.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was now left a good deal to herself, to get acquainted with the
house and grounds as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could, and spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) days very happily in so
doing, while those who might otherwise have attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) were shut
up, or wholly occupied each with the person quite dependent on them, at
this time, for everything like comfort; Edmund trying to bury his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own
feelings in exertions for the relief of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother’s, and Fanny
devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, returning to every former office with more
than former zeal, and thinking she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could never do enough for one who
seemed so much to want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>To talk over the dreadful business with Fanny, talk and lament, was all
Lady Bertram’s consolation. To be listened to and borne with, and hear
the voice of kindness and sympathy in return, was everything that could
be done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). To be otherwise comforted was out of the question. The
case admitted of no comfort. Lady Bertram did not think deeply, but,
guided by Sir Thomas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) thought justly on all important points; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) saw, therefore, in all its enormity, what had happened, and neither
endeavoured herself, nor required Fanny to advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), to think little
of guilt and infamy.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) affections were not acute, nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind tenacious. After a
time, Fanny found it not impossible to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts to other
subjects, and revive some interest in the usual occupations; but
whenever Lady Bertram _was_ fixed on the event, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) could see it only
in one light, as comprehending the loss of a daughter, and a disgrace
never to be wiped off.

<p/>Fanny learnt from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) all the particulars which had yet transpired. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
aunt was no very methodical narrator, but with the help of some letters
to and from Sir Thomas, and what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) already knew herself, and could
reasonably combine, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon able to understand quite as much as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished of the circumstances attending the story.

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth had gone, for the Easter holidays, to Twickenham, with a
family whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had just grown intimate with: a family of lively,
agreeable manners, and probably of morals and discretion to suit, for
to _their_ house Mr. Crawford had constant access at all times. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
having been in the same neighbourhood Fanny already knew. Mr. Rushworth
had been gone at this time to Bath, to pass a few days with his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother,
and bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back to town, and Maria was with these friends without
any restraint, without even Julia; for Julia had removed from Wimpole
Street two or three weeks before, on a visit to some relations of Sir
Thomas; a removal which her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) father and mother were now disposed to
attribute to some view of convenience on Mr. Yates’s account. Very soon
after the Rushworths’ return to Wimpole Street, Sir Thomas had received
a letter from an old and most particular friend in London, who hearing
and witnessing a good deal to alarm him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in that quarter, wrote to
recommend Sir Thomas’s coming to London himself, and using his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
influence with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter to put an end to the intimacy which was
already exposing her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to unpleasant remarks, and evidently making Mr.
Rushworth uneasy.

<p/>Sir Thomas was preparing to act upon this letter, without communicating
its contents to any creature at Mansfield, when it was followed by
another, sent express from the same friend, to break to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the almost
desperate situation in which affairs then stood with the young people.
Mrs. Rushworth had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) husband’s house: Mr. Rushworth had been in
great anger and distress to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)_ (Mr. Harding) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) advice; Mr.
Harding feared there had been _at_ _least_ very flagrant indiscretion.
The maidservant of Mrs. Rushworth, senior, threatened alarmingly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>)
was doing all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harding</b></font>) power to quiet everything, with the hope of Mrs.
Rushworth’s return, but was so much counteracted in Wimpole Street by
the influence of Mr. Rushworth’s mother, that the worst consequences
might be apprehended.

<p/>This dreadful communication could not be kept from the rest of the
family. Sir Thomas set off, Edmund would go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and the others
had been left in a state of wretchedness, inferior only to what
followed the receipt of the next letters from London. Everything was by
that time public beyond a hope. The servant of Mrs. Rushworth, the
mother, had exposure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) power, and supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mistress, was
not to be silenced. The two ladies, even in the short time they had
been together, had disagreed; and the bitterness of the elder against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) daughter-in-law might perhaps arise almost as much from the
personal disrespect with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) had herself been treated as from
sensibility for her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son.

<p/>However that might be, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was unmanageable. But had she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) been less
obstinate, or of less weight with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) son, who was always guided by the
last speaker, by the person who could get hold of and shut him (<font color='blue'><b>speaker</b></font>) up, the
case would still have been hopeless, for Mrs. Rushworth did not appear
again, and there was every reason to conclude her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to be concealed
somewhere with Mr. Crawford, who had quitted his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle’s house, as for
a journey, on the very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) absenting herself.

<p/>Sir Thomas, however, remained yet a little longer in town, in the hope
of discovering and snatching her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) from farther vice, though all was lost
on the side of character.

<p/>_His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)_ present state Fanny could hardly bear to think of. There was but
one of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) children who was not at this time a source of misery to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).
Tom’s complaints had been greatly heightened by the shock of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
sister’s conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) recovery so much thrown back by it, that even
Lady Bertram had been struck by the difference, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) alarms were
regularly sent off to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) husband; and Julia’s elopement, the
additional blow which had met him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) arrival in London, though its
force had been deadened at the moment, must, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) knew, be sorely felt.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) saw that it was. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letters expressed how much he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) deplored it.
Under any circumstances it would have been an unwelcome alliance; but
to have it so clandestinely formed, and such a period chosen for its
completion, placed Julia’s feelings in a most unfavourable light, and
severely aggravated the folly of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) choice. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) called it a bad thing,
done in the worst manner, and at the worst time; and though Julia was
yet as more pardonable than Maria as folly than vice, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could not but
regard the step she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had taken as opening the worst probabilities of a
conclusion hereafter like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister’s. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) opinion of the set
into which she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had thrown herself.

<p/>Fanny felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) most acutely. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) could have no comfort but in
Edmund. Every other child must be racking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) displeasure
against herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted, reasoning differently from Mrs. Norris,
would now be done away. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ should be justified. Mr. Crawford would
have fully acquitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) conduct in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); but this, though most
material to herself, would be poor consolation to Sir Thomas. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
uncle’s displeasure was terrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>); but what could her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
justification or her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) gratitude and attachment do for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)? His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stay must
be on Edmund alone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was mistaken, however, in supposing that Edmund gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father no
present pain. It was of a much less poignant nature than what the
others excited; but Sir Thomas was considering his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) happiness as very
deeply involved in the offence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sister and friend; cut off by it,
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must be, from the woman whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had been pursuing with undoubted
attachment and strong probability of success; and who, in everything
but this despicable brother, would have been so eligible a connexion.
He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was aware of what Edmund must be suffering on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own behalf, in
addition to all the rest, when they were in town: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had seen or
conjectured his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) feelings; and, having reason to think that one
interview with Miss Crawford had taken place, from which Edmund derived
only increased distress, had been as anxious on that account as on
others to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) out of town, and had engaged him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in taking Fanny home
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, with a view to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) relief and benefit, no less than
theirs. Fanny was not in the secret of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s feelings, Sir Thomas
not in the secret of Miss Crawford’s character. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) been privy to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to belong
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), though her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) twenty thousand pounds had been forty.

<p/>That Edmund must be for ever divided from Miss Crawford did not admit
of a doubt with Fanny; and yet, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) felt the same,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own conviction was insufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wanted
to be assured of it. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) would now speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the unreserve
which had sometimes been too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before, it would be most
consoling; but _that_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found was not to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seldom saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>):
never alone. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) probably avoided being alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). What was to be
inferred? That his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) judgment submitted to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own peculiar and
bitter share of this family affliction, but that it was too keenly felt
to be a subject of the slightest communication. This must be his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) state.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) yielded, but it was with agonies which did not admit of speech.
Long, long would it be ere Miss Crawford’s name passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lips again,
or she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hope for a renewal of such confidential intercourse as had
been.

<p/>It _was_ long. They reached Mansfield on Thursday, and it was not till
Sunday evening that Edmund began to talk to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on the subject. Sitting
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on Sunday evening—a wet Sunday evening—the very time of all
others when, if a friend is at hand, the heart must be opened, and
everything told; no one else in the room, except his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mother, who, after
hearing an affecting sermon, had cried herself to sleep, it was
impossible not to speak; and so, with the usual beginnings, hardly to
be traced as to what came first, and the usual declaration that if she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
would listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) for a few minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) should be very brief, and
certainly never tax her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) kindness in the same way again; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) need not
fear a repetition; it would be a subject prohibited entirely: he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
entered upon the luxury of relating circumstances and sensations of the
first interest to himself, to one of whose affectionate sympathy he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
quite convinced.

<p/>How Fanny listened, with what curiosity and concern, what pain and what
delight, how the agitation of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) voice was watched, and how carefully
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own eyes were fixed on any object but himself, may be imagined. The
opening was alarming. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had seen Miss Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been invited to
see her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had received a note from Lady Stornaway to beg him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to call;
and regarding it as what was meant to be the last, last interview of
friendship, and investing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) with all the feelings of shame and
wretchedness which Crawford’s sister ought to have known, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had gone
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in such a state of mind, so softened, so devoted, as made it for
a few moments impossible to Fanny’s fears that it should be the last.
But as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) story, these fears were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had met
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) said, with a serious—certainly a serious—even an agitated air;
but before he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had been able to speak one intelligible sentence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
introduced the subject in a manner which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) owned had shocked him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>). "<div class="bookquote">‘I
heard you were in town,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">‘I wanted to see you. Let us talk
over this sad business. What can equal the folly of our two relations?’
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I could not answer, but I believe my looks spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt reproved.
Sometimes how quick to feel! With a graver look and voice she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then
added, <div class="bookquote">‘I do not mean to defend Henry at your sister’s expense.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>So she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
began, but how she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) went on, Fanny, is not fit, is hardly fit to be
repeated to you. I cannot recall all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) words. I would not dwell upon
them if I could. Their substance was great anger at the _folly_ of
each. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reprobated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother’s folly in being drawn on by a woman
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had never cared for, to do what must lose him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
adored; but still more the folly of poor Maria, in sacrificing such a
situation, plunging into such difficulties, under the idea of being
really loved by a man who had long ago made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) indifference clear.
Guess what I must have felt. To hear the woman whom—no harsher name
than folly given! So voluntarily, so freely, so coolly to canvass it!
No reluctance, no horror, no feminine, shall I say, no modest
loathings? This is what the world does. For where, Fanny, shall we find
a woman whom nature had so richly endowed? Spoilt, spoilt!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>After a little reflection, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went on with a sort of desperate
calmness. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I will tell you everything, and then have done for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
saw it only as folly, and that folly stamped only by exposure. The want
of common discretion, of caution: his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going down to Richmond for the
whole time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being at Twickenham; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) putting herself in the power
of a servant; it was the detection, in short—oh, Fanny! it was the
detection, not the offence, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reprobated. It was the imprudence
which had brought things to extremity, and obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother to give
up every dearer plan in order to fly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stopt. " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>And what," said Fanny (believing herself required to speak),
"what could you say?"

<p/>"Nothing, nothing to be understood. I was like a man stunned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went
on, began to talk of you; yes, then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to talk of you,
regretting, as well she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might, the loss of such a—. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke
very rationally. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has always done justice to you. <div class="bookquote">‘He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has thrown
away,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘such a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will never see again. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would
have fixed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) happy for ever.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>My dearest
Fanny, I am giving you, I hope, more pleasure than pain by this
retrospect of what might have been—but what never can be now. You do

have done.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>No look or word was given.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>Thank God," said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). "We were all disposed to wonder, but it seems to
have been the merciful appointment of Providence that the heart which
knew no guile should not suffer. She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) spoke of you with high praise and
warm affection; yet, even here, there was alloy, a dash of evil; for in
the midst of it she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) could exclaim, <div class="bookquote">‘Why would not she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) have him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)? It is

him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) ought, they might now have been on the point of marriage,
and Henry would have been too happy and too busy to want any other
object. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would have taken no pains to be on terms with Mrs. Rushworth
again. It would have all ended in a regular standing flirtation, in
yearly meetings at Sotherton and Everingham.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Could you have believed
it possible? But the charm is broken. My eyes are opened."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Cruel!"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, "quite cruel. At such a moment to give way to
gaiety, to speak with lightness, and to you! Absolute cruelty."

<p/>"Cruelty, do you call it? We differ there. No, hers is not a cruel
nature. I do not consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as meaning to wound my feelings. The evil
lies yet deeper: in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) total ignorance, unsuspiciousness of there
being such feelings; in a perversion of mind which made it natural to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to treat the subject as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was speaking only as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
been used to hear others speak, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) imagined everybody else would
speak. Hers are not faults of temper. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not voluntarily give
unnecessary pain to any one, and though I may deceive myself, I cannot
but think that for me, for my feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would—. Hers are faults of
principle, Fanny; of blunted delicacy and a corrupted, vitiated mind.
Perhaps it is best for me, since it leaves me so little to regret. Not
so, however. Gladly would I submit to all the increased pain of losing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), rather than have to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as I do. I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so."

<p/>"Did you?"

<p/>"Yes; when I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so."

<p/>"How long were you together?"

<p/>"Five-and-twenty minutes. Well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went on to say that what remained
now to be done was to bring about a marriage between them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of
it, Fanny, with a steadier voice than I can.<div class="bookquote">" He (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was obliged to pause
more than once as he (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">‘We must persuade Henry to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),’

one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stamp, and therefore I hope we may find no insuperable
difficulty. My influence, which is not small shall all go that way; and
when once married, and properly supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own family, people of
respectability as they are, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) may recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) footing in society to a
certain degree. In some circles, we know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would never be admitted,
but with good dinners, and large parties, there will always be those
who will be glad of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acquaintance; and there is, undoubtedly, more
liberality and candour on those points than formerly. What I advise is,
that your father be quiet. Do not let him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) injure his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own cause by
interference. Persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to let things take their course. If by any
officious exertions of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is induced to leave Henry’s protection,
there will be much less chance of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) than if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remain
with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I know how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is likely to be influenced. Let Sir Thomas
trust to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) honour and compassion, and it may all end well; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
get his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughter away, it will be destroying the chief hold.’ (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"

<p/>After repeating this, Edmund was so much affected that Fanny, watching
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with silent, but most tender concern, was almost sorry that the
subject had been entered on at all. It was long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could speak
again. At last, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Now, Fanny," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), "I shall soon have done. I have
told you the substance of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said. As soon as I could speak,
I replied that I had not supposed it possible, coming in such a state
of mind into that house as I had done, that anything could occur to
make me suffer more, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been inflicting deeper wounds in
almost every sentence. That though I had, in the course of our
acquaintance, been often sensible of some difference in our opinions,
on points, too, of some moment, it had not entered my imagination to
conceive the difference could be such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now proved it. That
the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) treated the dreadful crime committed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
brother and my sister (with whom lay the greater seduction I pretended
not to say), but the manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of the crime itself,
giving it every reproach but the right; considering its ill
consequences only as they were to be braved or overborne by a defiance
of decency and impudence in wrong; and last of all, and above all,
recommending to us a compliance, a compromise, an acquiescence in the
continuance of the sin, on the chance of a marriage which, thinking as
I now thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, should rather be prevented than sought;
all this together most grievously convinced me that I had never
understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before, and that, as far as related to mind, it had been
the creature of my own imagination, not Miss Crawford, that I had been
too apt to dwell on for many months past. That, perhaps, it was best
for me; I had less to regret in sacrificing a friendship, feelings,
hopes which must, at any rate, have been torn from me now. And yet,
that I must and would confess that, could I have restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had appeared to me before, I would infinitely prefer any increase
of the pain of parting, for the sake of carrying with me the right of
tenderness and esteem. This is what I said, the purport of it; but, as
you may imagine, not spoken so collectedly or methodically as I have
repeated it to you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was astonished, exceedingly astonished—more
than astonished. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) change countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned extremely
red. I imagined I saw a mixture of many feelings: a great, though short
struggle; half a wish of yielding to truths, half a sense of shame, but
habit, habit carried it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have laughed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could. It was a
sort of laugh, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) answered, <div class="bookquote">‘A pretty good lecture, upon my word.
Was it part of your last sermon? At this rate you will soon reform
everybody at Mansfield and Thornton Lacey; and when I hear of you next,
it may be as a celebrated preacher in some great society of Methodists,
or as a missionary into foreign parts.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) tried to speak carelessly,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was not so careless as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wanted to appear. I only said in
reply, that from my heart I wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) well, and earnestly hoped that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might soon learn to think more justly, and not owe the most
valuable knowledge we could any of us acquire, the knowledge of
ourselves and of our duty, to the lessons of affliction, and
immediately left the room. I had gone a few steps, Fanny, when I heard
the door open behind me. <div class="bookquote">‘Mr. Bertram,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). I looked back. <div class="bookquote">‘Mr.
Bertram,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with a smile; but it was a smile ill-suited to the
conversation that had passed, a saucy playful smile, seeming to invite
in order to subdue me; at least it appeared so to me. I resisted; it
was the impulse of the moment to resist, and still walked on. I have
since, sometimes, for a moment, regretted that I did not go back, but I
know I was right, and such has been the end of our acquaintance. And
what an acquaintance has it been! How have I been deceived! Equally in
brother and sister deceived! I thank you for your patience, Fanny. This
has been the greatest relief, and now we will have done."

<p/>And such was Fanny’s dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words, that for five minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought they _had_ done. Then, however, it all came on again, or
something very like it, and nothing less than Lady Bertram’s rousing
thoroughly up could really close such a conversation. Till that
happened, they continued to talk of Miss Crawford alone, and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had attached him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and how delightful nature had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and how
excellent she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have been, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) fallen into good hands earlier.
Fanny, now at liberty to speak openly, felt more than justified in
adding to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) real character, by some hint of what
share his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) brother’s state of health might be supposed to have in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
wish for a complete reconciliation. This was not an agreeable
intimation. Nature resisted it for a while. It would have been a vast
deal pleasanter to have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) more disinterested in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attachment;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) vanity was not of a strength to fight long against reason. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
submitted to believe that Tom’s illness had influenced her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), only
reserving for himself this consoling thought, that considering the many
counteractions of opposing habits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had certainly been _more_
attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) than could have been expected, and for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sake been
more near doing right. Fanny thought exactly the same; and they were
also quite agreed in their opinion of the lasting effect, the indelible
impression, which such a disappointment must make on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mind. Time
would undoubtedly abate somewhat of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sufferings, but still it was a
sort of thing which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never could get entirely the better of; and as
to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever meeting with any other woman who could—it was too
impossible to be named but with indignation. Fanny’s friendship was all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had to cling to.
