<p/>Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but as neither provocation nor resentment were discerned by Mr. Knightley, who had been of the party, and had seen only proper attention and pleasing behaviour on each side, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was expressing the next morning, being at Hartfield again on business with Mr. Woodhouse, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) approbation of the whole; not so openly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might have done had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father been out of the room, but speaking plain enough to be very intelligible to Emma. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been used to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unjust to Jane, and had now great pleasure in marking an improvement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A very pleasant evening,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) began, as soon as Mr. Woodhouse had been talked into what was necessary, told that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) understood, and the papers swept away; "particularly pleasant. You and Miss Fairfax gave us some very good music. I do not know a more luxurious state, sir, than sitting at one's ease to be entertained a whole evening by two such young women; sometimes with music and sometimes with conversation. I am sure Miss Fairfax must have found the evening pleasant, Emma. You left nothing undone. I was glad you made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) play so much, for having no instrument at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) grandmother's, it must have been a real indulgence."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am happy you approved,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling; "but I hope I am not often deficient in what is due to guests at Hartfield."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father instantly; "that I am sure you are not. There is nobody half so attentive and civil as you are. If any thing, you are too attentive. The muffin last night if it had been handed round once, I think it would have been enough."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, nearly at the same time; "you are not often deficient; not often deficient either in manner or comprehension. I think you understand me, therefore."

<p/>An arch look expressed "I understand you well enough;<div class="bookquote">" but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said only, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Miss Fairfax is reserved."

<p/>"I always told you she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was a little; but you will soon overcome all that part of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reserve which ought to be overcome, all that has its foundation in diffidence. What arises from discretion must be honoured."

<p/>"You think her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) diffident. I do not see it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), moving from his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) chair into one close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "you are not going to tell me, I hope, that you had not a pleasant evening."

<p/>"Oh! no; I was pleased with my own perseverance in asking questions; and amused to think how little information I obtained."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am disappointed,"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) only answer.

<p/>"I hope every body had a pleasant evening," said Mr. Woodhouse, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) quiet way. "I had. Once, I felt the fire rather too much; but then I moved back my chair a little, a very little, and it did not disturb me. Miss Bates was very chatty and good-humoured, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) always is, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) speaks rather too quick. However, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is very agreeable, and Mrs. Bates too, in a different way. I like old friends; and Miss Jane Fairfax is a very pretty sort of young lady, a very pretty and a very well-behaved young lady indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must have found the evening agreeable, Mr. Knightley, because she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had Emma."

<p/>"True, sir; and Emma, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had Miss Fairfax."

<p/>Emma saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety, and wishing to appease it, at least for the present, said, and with a sincerity which no one could question

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is a sort of elegant creature that one cannot keep one's eyes from. I am always watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to admire; and I do pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from my heart."

<p/>Mr. Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were more gratified than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cared to express; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could make any reply, Mr. Woodhouse, whose thoughts were on the Bates's, said

<p/>"It is a great pity that their circumstances should be so confined! a great pity indeed! and I have often wished but it is so little one can venture to do small, trifling presents, of any thing uncommon Now we have killed a porker, and Emma thinks of sending them a loin or a leg; it is very small and delicate Hartfield pork is not like any other pork but still it is pork and, my dear Emma, unless one could be sure of their making it into steaks, nicely fried, as ours are fried, without the smallest grease, and not roast it, for no stomach can bear roast pork I think we had better send the leg do not you think so, my dear?"

<p/>"My dear papa, I sent the whole hind-quarter. I knew you would wish it. There will be the leg to be salted, you know, which is so very nice, and the loin to be dressed directly in any manner they like."

<p/>"That's right, my dear, very right. I had not thought of it before, but that is the best way. They must not over-salt the leg; and then, if it is not over-salted, and if it is very thoroughly boiled, just as Serle boils ours, and eaten very moderately of, with a boiled turnip, and a little carrot or parsnip, I do not consider it unwholesome."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley presently, "I have a piece of news for you. You like news and I heard an article in my way hither that I think will interest you."

<p/>"News! Oh! yes, I always like news. What is it? why do you smile so? where did you hear it? at Randalls?"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had time only to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, not at Randalls; I have not been near Randalls,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>when the door was thrown open, and Miss Bates and Miss Fairfax walked into the room. Full of thanks, and full of news, Miss Bates knew not which to give quickest. Mr. Knightley soon saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) moment, and that not another syllable of communication could rest with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).

<p/>"Oh! my dear sir, how are you this morning? My dear Miss Woodhouse I come quite over-powered. Such a beautiful hind-quarter of pork! You are too bountiful! Have you heard the news? Mr. Elton is going to be married.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma had not had time even to think of Mr. Elton, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so completely surprized that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not avoid a little start, and a little blush, at the sound.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>There is my news: I thought it would interest you," said Mr. Knightley, with a smile which implied a conviction of some part of what had passed between them.

<p/>"But where could you hear it?<div class="bookquote">" cried Miss Bates. " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Where could you possibly hear it, Mr. Knightley? For it is not five minutes since I received Mrs. Cole's note no, it cannot be more than five or at least ten for I had got my bonnet and spencer on, just ready to come out I was only gone down to speak to Patty again about the pork Jane was standing in the passage were not you, Jane? for my mother was so afraid that we had not any salting-pan large enough. So I said I would go down and see, and Jane said, 'Shall I go down instead? for I think you have a little cold, and Patty has been washing the kitchen.<div class="bookquote">' ' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! my dear,' said I well, and just then came the note. A Miss Hawkins that's all I know. A Miss Hawkins of Bath. But, Mr. Knightley, how could you possibly have heard it? for the very moment Mr. Cole told Mrs. Cole of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) sat down and wrote to me. A Miss Hawkins "

<p/>"I was with Mr. Cole on business an hour and a half ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had just read Elton's letter as I was shewn in, and handed it to me directly."

<p/>"Well! that is quite I suppose there never was a piece of news more generally interesting. My dear sir, you really are too bountiful. My mother desires her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) very best compliments and regards, and a thousand thanks, and says you really quite oppress her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We consider our Hartfield pork,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Woodhouse "indeed it certainly is, so very superior to all other pork, that Emma and I cannot have a greater pleasure than "

<p/>"Oh! my dear sir, as my mother says, our friends are only too good to us. If ever there were people who, without having great wealth themselves, had every thing they could wish for, I am sure it is us. We may well say that <div class="bookquote">'our lot is cast in a goodly heritage.'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Well, Mr. Knightley, and so you actually saw the letter; well "

<p/>"It was short merely to announce but cheerful, exulting, of course.<div class="bookquote">"  Here was a sly glance at Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been so fortunate as to I forget the precise words one has no business to remember them. The information was, as you state, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was going to be married to a Miss Hawkins. By his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) style, I should imagine it just settled.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton/Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton going to be married!" said Emma, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will have every body's wishes for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is very young to settle,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>was Mr. Woodhouse's observation. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had better not be in a hurry. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to me very well off as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was. We were always glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at Hartfield."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A new neighbour for us all, Miss Woodhouse!"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bates, joyfully; "my mother is so pleased! she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot bear to have the poor old Vicarage without a mistress. This is great news, indeed. Jane, you have never seen Mr. Elton! no wonder that you have such a curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane's curiosity did not appear of that absorbing nature as wholly to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No I have never seen Mr. Elton," she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) replied, starting on this appeal; "is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a tall man?"

<p/>"Who shall answer that question?<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>My father would say <div class="bookquote">'yes,'  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley 'no;' and Miss Bates and I that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the happy medium. When you have been here a little longer, Miss Fairfax, you will understand that Mr. Elton is the standard of perfection in Highbury, both in person and mind."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very true, Miss Woodhouse, so she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) will. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is the very best young man But, my dear Jane, if you remember, I told you yesterday he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was precisely the height of Mr. Perry. Miss Hawkins, I dare say, an excellent young woman. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) extreme attention to my mother wanting her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) to sit in the vicarage pew, that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) might hear the better, for my mother is a little deaf, you know it is not much, but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not hear quite quick. Jane says that Colonel Campbell is a little deaf. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fancied bathing might be good for it the warm bath but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) says it did him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) no lasting benefit. Colonel Campbell, you know, is quite our angel. And Mr. Dixon seems a very charming young man, quite worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>). It is such a happiness when good people get together and they always do. Now, here will be Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins; and there are the Coles, such very good people; and the Perrys I suppose there never was a happier or a better couple than Mr. and Mrs. Perry. I say, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>turning to Mr. Woodhouse, <div class="bookquote">"I think there are few places with such society as Highbury. I always say, we are quite blessed in our neighbours. My dear sir, if there is one thing my mother loves better than another, it is pork a roast loin of pork "

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"As to who, or what Miss Hawkins is, or how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) has been acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "nothing I suppose can be known. One feels that it cannot be a very long acquaintance. He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) has been gone only four weeks."

<p/>Nobody had any information to give; and, after a few more wonderings, Emma said,

<p/>"You are silent, Miss Fairfax but I hope you mean to take an interest in this news. You, who have been hearing and seeing so much of late on these subjects, who must have been so deep in the business on Miss Campbell's account we shall not excuse your being indifferent about Mr. Elton and Miss Hawkins."

<p/>"When I have seen Mr. Elton," replied Jane, "I dare say I shall be interested but I believe it requires that with me. And as it is some months since Miss Campbell married, the impression may be a little worn off."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has been gone just four weeks, as you observe, Miss Woodhouse,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bates, <div class="bookquote">"four weeks yesterday. A Miss Hawkins! Well, I had always rather fancied it would be some young lady hereabouts; not that I ever Mrs. Cole once whispered to me but I immediately said, ' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates/Bates</b></font>)</div>No, Mr. Elton is a most worthy young man but' In short, I do not think I am particularly quick at those sort of discoveries. I do not pretend to it. What is before me, I see. At the same time, nobody could wonder if Mr. Elton should have aspired Miss Woodhouse lets me chatter on, so good-humouredly. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knows I would not offend for the world. How does Miss Smith do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) seems quite recovered now. Have you heard from Mrs. John Knightley lately? Oh! those dear little children. Jane, do you know I always fancy Mr. Dixon like Mr. John Knightley. I mean in person tall, and with that sort of look and not very talkative."

<p/>"Quite wrong, my dear aunt; there is no likeness at all."

<p/>"Very odd! but one never does form a just idea of any body beforehand. One takes up a notion, and runs away with it. Mr. Dixon, you say, is not, strictly speaking, handsome?"

<p/>"Handsome! Oh! no far from it certainly plain. I told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was plain."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear, you said that Miss Campbell would not allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) to be plain, and that you yourself "

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! as for me, my judgment is worth nothing. Where I have a regard, I always think a person well-looking. But I gave what I believed the general opinion, when I called him (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) plain."

<p/>"Well, my dear Jane, I believe we must be running away. The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most agreeable piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly I would not have you out in a shower! We think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is the better for Highbury already. Thank you, we do indeed. I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very! I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) your arm. Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins! Good morning to you."

<p/>Emma, alone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, had half her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention wanted by him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lamented that young people would be in such a hurry to marry and to marry strangers too and the other half she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could give to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own view of the subject. It was to herself an amusing and a very welcome piece of news, as proving that Mr. Elton could not have suffered long; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry for Harriet: Harriet must feel it and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hope was, by giving the first information herself, to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from hearing it abruptly from others. It was now about the time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was likely to call. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were to meet Miss Bates in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) way! and upon its beginning to rain, Emma was obliged to expect that the weather would be detaining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at Mrs. Goddard's, and that the intelligence would undoubtedly rush upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) without preparation.

<p/>The shower was heavy, but short; and it had not been over five minutes, when in came Harriet, with just the heated, agitated look which hurrying thither with a full heart was likely to give; and the "Oh! Miss Woodhouse, what do you think has happened!" which instantly burst forth, had all the evidence of corresponding perturbation. As the blow was given, Emma felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not now shew greater kindness than in listening; and Harriet, unchecked, ran eagerly through what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had to tell. <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had set out from Mrs. Goddard's half an hour ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had been afraid it would rain she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had been afraid it would pour down every moment but she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) might get to Hartfield first she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had hurried on as fast as possible; but then, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was passing by the house where a young woman was making up a gown for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would just step in and see how it went on; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not seem to stay half a moment there, soon after she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) came out it began to rain, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) did not know what to do; so she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ran on directly, as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could, and took shelter at Ford's."  (<font color='red'><b>Ford</b></font>)</div>Ford's was the principal woollen-draper, linen-draper, and haberdasher's shop united; the shop first in size and fashion in the place. "And so, there she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had set, without an idea of any thing in the world, full ten minutes, perhaps when, all of a sudden, who should come in to be sure it was so very odd! but they always dealt at Ford's who should come in, but Elizabeth Martin and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brother! Dear Miss Woodhouse! only think. I thought I should have fainted. I did not know what to do. I was sitting near the door Elizabeth saw me directly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was busy with the umbrella. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw me, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked away directly, and took no notice; and they both went to quite the farther end of the shop; and I kept sitting near the door! Oh! dear; I was so miserable! I am sure I must have been as white as my gown. I could not go away you know, because of the rain; but I did so wish myself anywhere in the world but there. Oh! dear, Miss Woodhouse well, at last, I fancy, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked round and saw me; for instead of going on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) buyings, they began whispering to one another. I am sure they were talking of me; and I could not help thinking that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to speak to me (do you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was, Miss Woodhouse?) for presently she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came forward came quite up to me, and asked me how I did, and seemed ready to shake hands, if I would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not do any of it in the same way that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) used; I could see she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was altered; but, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to try to be very friendly, and we shook hands, and stood talking some time; but I know no more what I said I was in such a tremble! I remember she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was sorry we never met now; which I thought almost too kind! Dear, Miss Woodhouse, I was absolutely miserable! By that time, it was beginning to hold up, and I was determined that nothing should stop me from getting away and then only think! I found he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was coming up towards me too slowly you know, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not quite know what to do; and so he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came and spoke, and I answered and I stood for a minute, feeling dreadfully, you know, one can't tell how; and then I took courage, and said it did not rain, and I must go; and so off I set; and I had not got three yards from the door, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) came after me, only to say, if I was going to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought I had much better go round by Mr. Cole's stables, for I should find the near way quite floated by this rain. Oh! dear, I thought it would have been the death of me! So I said, I was very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>): you know I could not do less; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went back to Elizabeth, and I came round by the stables I believe I did but I hardly knew where I was, or any thing about it. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I would rather done any thing than have it happen: and yet, you know, there was a sort of satisfaction in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) behave so pleasantly and so kindly. And Elizabeth, too. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, do talk to me and make me comfortable again."

<p/>Very sincerely did Emma wish to do so; but it was not immediately in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) power. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged to stop and think. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not thoroughly comfortable herself. The young man's conduct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister's, seemed the result of real feeling, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not but pity them. As Harriet described it, there had been an interesting mixture of wounded affection and genuine delicacy in their behaviour. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had believed them to be well-meaning, worthy people before; and what difference did this make in the evils of the connexion? It was folly to be disturbed by it. Of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must be sorry to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) they must be all sorry. Ambition, as well as love, had probably been mortified. They might all have hoped to rise by Harriet's acquaintance: and besides, what was the value of Harriet's description? So easily pleased so little discerning; what signified her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) praise?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) exerted herself, and did try to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) comfortable, by considering all that had passed as a mere trifle, and quite unworthy of being dwelt on,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It might be distressing, for the moment,"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"but you seem to have behaved extremely well; and it is over and may never can never, as a first meeting, occur again, and therefore you need not think about it."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Harriet said, <div class="bookquote">"very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) "would not think about it;" but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) talked of it still she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could talk of nothing else; and Emma, at last, in order to put the Martins out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, was obliged to hurry on the news, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had meant to give with so much tender caution; hardly knowing herself whether to rejoice or be angry, ashamed or only amused, at such a state of mind in poor Harriet such a conclusion of Mr. Elton's importance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)!

<p/>Mr. Elton's rights, however, gradually revived. Though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not feel the first intelligence as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have done the day before, or an hour before, its interest soon increased; and before their first conversation was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had talked herself into all the sensations of curiosity, wonder and regret, pain and pleasure, as to this fortunate Miss Hawkins, which could conduce to place the Martins under proper subordination in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) fancy.

<p/>Emma learned to be rather glad that there had been such a meeting. It had been serviceable in deadening the first shock, without retaining any influence to alarm. As Harriet now lived, the Martins could not get at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), without seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), where hitherto they had wanted either the courage or the condescension to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) refusal of the brother, the sisters never had been at Mrs. Goddard's; and a twelvemonth might pass without their being thrown together again, with any necessity, or even any power of speech.
