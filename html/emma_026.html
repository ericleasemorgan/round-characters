<p/>Frank Churchill came back again; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) kept his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's dinner waiting, it was not known at Hartfield; for Mrs. Weston was too anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being a favourite with Mr. Woodhouse, to betray any imperfection which could be concealed.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came back, had had his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut, and laughed at himself with a very good grace, but without seeming really at all ashamed of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had done. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had no reason to wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair longer, to conceal any confusion of face; no reason to wish the money unspent, to improve his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) spirits. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was quite as undaunted and as lively as ever; and, after seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), Emma thus moralised to herself:

<p/>"I do not know whether it ought to be so, but certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly. It depends upon the character of those who handle it. Mr. Knightley, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not a trifling, silly young man. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have done this differently. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would either have gloried in the achievement, or been ashamed of it. There would have been either the ostentation of a coxcomb, or the evasions of a mind too weak to defend its own vanities. No, I am perfectly sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not trifling or silly."

<p/>With Tuesday came the agreeable prospect of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) again, and for a longer time than hitherto; of judging of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) general manners, and by inference, of the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners towards herself; of guessing how soon it might be necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) to throw coldness into her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) air; and of fancying what the observations of all those might be, who were now seeing them together for the first time.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) meant to be very happy, in spite of the scene being laid at Mr. Cole's; and without being able to forget that among the failings of Mr. Elton, even in the days of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour, none had disturbed her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) propensity to dine with Mr. Cole.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>its</b></font>) father's comfort was amply secured, Mrs. Bates as well as Mrs. Goddard being able to come; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) last pleasing duty, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) left the house, was to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) respects to them as they sat together after dinner; and while her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) father was fondly noticing the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) dress, to make the two ladies all the amends in her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) power, by helping them to large slices of cake and full glasses of wine, for whatever unwilling self-denial his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) care of their constitution might have obliged them to practise during the meal. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had provided a plentiful dinner for them; she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could know that they had been allowed to eat it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) followed another carriage to Mr. Cole's door; and was pleased to see that it was Mr. Knightley's; for Mr. Knightley keeping no horses, having little spare money and a great deal of health, activity, and independence, was too apt, in Emma's opinion, to get about as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could, and not use his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) carriage so often as became the owner of Donwell Abbey. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had an opportunity now of speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) approbation while warm from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) stopped to hand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is coming as you should do,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); "like a gentleman. I am quite glad to see you."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), observing, "How lucky that we should arrive at the same moment! for, if we had met first in the drawing-room, I doubt whether you would have discerned me to be more of a gentleman than usual. You might not have distinguished how I came, by my look or manner."

<p/>"Yes I should, I am sure I should. There is always a look of consciousness or bustle when people come in a way which they know to be beneath them. You think you carry it off very well, I dare say, but with you it is a sort of bravado, an air of affected unconcern; I always observe it whenever I meet you under those circumstances. Now you have nothing to try for. You are not afraid of being supposed ashamed. You are not striving to look taller than any body else. Now I shall really be very happy to walk into the same room with you."

<p/>"Nonsensical girl!" was his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) reply, but not at all in anger.

<p/>Emma had as much reason to be satisfied with the rest of the party as with Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was received with a cordial respect which could not but please, and given all the consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could wish for. When the Westons arrived, the kindest looks of love, the strongest of admiration were for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), from both husband and wife; the son approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a cheerful eagerness which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) peculiar object, and at dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) firmly believed, not without some dexterity on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side.

<p/>The party was rather large, as it included one other family, a proper unobjectionable country family, whom the Coles had the advantage of naming among their acquaintance, and the male part of Mr. Cox's family, the lawyer of Highbury. The less worthy females were to come in the evening, with Miss Bates, Miss Fairfax, and Miss Smith; but already, at dinner, they were too numerous for any subject of conversation to be general; and, while politics and Mr. Elton were talked over, Emma could fairly surrender all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention to the pleasantness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) neighbour. The first remote sound to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt herself obliged to attend, was the name of Jane Fairfax. Mrs. Cole seemed to be relating something of her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) that was expected to be very interesting. She (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) listened, and found it well worth listening to. That very dear part of Emma, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy, received an amusing supply. Mrs. Cole was telling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had been calling on Miss Bates, and as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) entered the room had been struck by the sight of a pianoforte a very elegant looking instrument not a grand, but a large-sized square pianoforte; and the substance of the story, the end of all the dialogue which ensued of surprize, and inquiry, and congratulations on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) side, and explanations on Miss Bates's, was, that this pianoforte had arrived from Broadwood's the day before, to the great astonishment of both aunt and niece entirely unexpected; that at first, by Miss Bates's account, Jane herself was quite at a loss, quite bewildered to think who could possibly have ordered it but now, they were both perfectly satisfied that it could be from only one quarter; of course it must be from Colonel Campbell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"One can suppose nothing else,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Cole</b></font>)</div>added Mrs. Cole, "and I was only surprized that there could ever have been a doubt. But Jane, it seems, had a letter from them very lately, and not a word was said about it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knows their ways best; but I should not consider their silence as any reason for their not meaning to make the present. They might chuse to surprize her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Cole had many to agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>); every body who spoke on the subject was equally convinced that it must come from Colonel Campbell, and equally rejoiced that such a present had been made; and there were enough ready to speak to allow Emma to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and still listen to Mrs. Cole.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I declare, I do not know when I have heard any thing that has given me more satisfaction! It always has quite hurt me that Jane Fairfax, who plays so delightfully, should not have an instrument. It seemed quite a shame, especially considering how many houses there are where fine instruments are absolutely thrown away. This is like giving ourselves a slap, to be sure! and it was but yesterday I was telling Mr. Cole, I really was ashamed to look at our new grand pianoforte in the drawing-room, while I do not know one note from another, and our little girls, who are but just beginning, perhaps may never make any thing of it; and there is poor Jane Fairfax, who is mistress of music, has not any thing of the nature of an instrument, not even the pitifullest old spinet in the world, to amuse herself with. I was saying this to Mr. Cole but yesterday, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) quite agreed with me; only he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is so particularly fond of music that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could not help indulging himself in the purchase, hoping that some of our good neighbours might be so obliging occasionally to put it to a better use than we can; and that really is the reason why the instrument was bought or else I am sure we ought to be ashamed of it. We are in great hopes that Miss Woodhouse may be prevailed with to try it this evening.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Woodhouse made the proper acquiescence; and finding that nothing more was to be entrapped from any communication of Mrs. Cole's, turned to Frank Churchill.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Why do you smile?" said she (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>).

<p/>"Nay, why do you?"

<p/>"Me! I suppose I smile for pleasure at Colonel Campbell's being so rich and so liberal. It is a handsome present."

<p/>"Very."

<p/>"I rather wonder that it was never made before."

<p/>"Perhaps Miss Fairfax has never been staying here so long before."

<p/>"Or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) the use of their own instrument which must now be shut up in London, untouched by any body."

<p/>"That is a grand pianoforte, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) might think it too large for Mrs. Bates's house."

<p/>"You may say what you chuse but your countenance testifies that your thoughts on this subject are very much like mine."

<p/>"I do not know. I rather believe you are giving me more credit for acuteness than I deserve. I smile because you smile, and shall probably suspect whatever I find you suspect; but at present I do not see what there is to question. If Colonel Campbell is not the person, who can be?"

<p/>"What do you say to Mrs. Dixon?"

<p/>"Mrs. Dixon! very true indeed. I had not thought of Mrs. Dixon. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must know as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) father, how acceptable an instrument would be; and perhaps the mode of it, the mystery, the surprize, is more like a young woman's scheme than an elderly man's. It is Mrs. Dixon, I dare say. I told you that your suspicions would guide mine."

<p/>"If so, you must extend your suspicions and comprehend Mr. Dixon in them.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Dixon</b></font>)</div>Mr. Dixon. Very well. Yes, I immediately perceive that it must be the joint present of Mr. and Mrs. Dixon. We were speaking the other day, you know, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) being so warm an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) performance."

<p/>"Yes, and what you told me on that head, confirmed an idea which I had entertained before. I do not mean to reflect upon the good intentions of either Mr. Dixon or Miss Fairfax, but I cannot help suspecting either that, after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) proposals to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) had the misfortune to fall in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>), or that he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) became conscious of a little attachment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) side. One might guess twenty things without guessing exactly the right; but I am sure there must be a particular cause for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) chusing to come to Highbury instead of going with the Campbells to Ireland. Here, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) must be leading a life of privation and penance; there it would have been all enjoyment. As to the pretence of trying her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) native air, I look upon that as a mere excuse. In the summer it might have passed; but what can any body's native air do for them in the months of January, February, and March? Good fires and carriages would be much more to the purpose in most cases of delicate health, and I dare say in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)'s. I do not require you to adopt all my suspicions, though you make so noble a profession of doing it, but I honestly tell you what they are."

<p/>"And, upon my word, they have an air of great probability. Mr. Dixon's preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) music to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) friend's, I can answer for being very decided."

<p/>"And then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) life. Did you ever hear of that? A water party; and by some accident she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) was falling overboard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) did. I was there one of the party."

<p/>"Were you really? Well! But you observed nothing of course, for it seems to be a new idea to you. If I had been there, I think I should have made some discoveries."

<p/>"I dare say you would; but I, simple I, saw nothing but the fact, that Miss Fairfax was nearly dashed from the vessel and that Mr. Dixon caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>). It was the work of a moment. And though the consequent shock and alarm was very great and much more durable indeed I believe it was half an hour before any of us were comfortable again yet that was too general a sensation for any thing of peculiar anxiety to be observable. I do not mean to say, however, that you might not have made discoveries."

<p/>The conversation was here interrupted. They were called on to share in the awkwardness of a rather long interval between the courses, and obliged to be as formal and as orderly as the others; but when the table was again safely covered, when every corner dish was placed exactly right, and occupation and ease were generally restored, Emma said,

<p/>"The arrival of this pianoforte is decisive with me. I wanted to know a little more, and this tells me quite enough. Depend upon it, we shall soon hear that it is a present from Mr. and Mrs. Dixon."

<p/>"And if the Dixons should absolutely deny all knowledge of it we must conclude it to come from the Campbells."

<p/>"No, I am sure it is not from the Campbells. Miss Fairfax knows it is not from the Campbells, or they would have been guessed at first. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) would not have been puzzled, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) dared fix on them. I may not have convinced you perhaps, but I am perfectly convinced myself that Mr. Dixon is a principal in the business."

<p/>"Indeed you injure me if you suppose me unconvinced. Your reasonings carry my judgment along with them entirely. At first, while I supposed you satisfied that Colonel Campbell was the giver, I saw it only as paternal kindness, and thought it the most natural thing in the world. But when you mentioned Mrs. Dixon, I felt how much more probable that it should be the tribute of warm female friendship. And now I can see it in no other light than as an offering of love."

<p/>There was no occasion to press the matter farther. The conviction seemed real; he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) felt it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) said no more, other subjects took their turn; and the rest of the dinner passed away; the dessert succeeded, the children came in, and were talked to and admired amid the usual rate of conversation; a few clever things said, a few downright silly, but by much the larger proportion neither the one nor the other nothing worse than everyday remarks, dull repetitions, old news, and heavy jokes.

<p/>The ladies had not been long in the drawing-room, before the other ladies, in their different divisions, arrived. Emma watched the entree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own particular little friend; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not exult in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dignity and grace, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not only love the blooming sweetness and the artless manner, but could most heartily rejoice in that light, cheerful, unsentimental disposition which allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so many alleviations of pleasure, in the midst of the pangs of disappointed affection. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat and who would have guessed how many tears she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been lately shedding? To be in company, nicely dressed herself and seeing others nicely dressed, to sit and smile and look pretty, and say nothing, was enough for the happiness of the present hour. Jane Fairfax did look and move superior; but Emma suspected she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been glad to change feelings with Harriet, very glad to have purchased the mortification of having loved yes, of having loved even Mr. Elton in vain by the surrender of all the dangerous pleasure of knowing herself beloved by the husband of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.

<p/>In so large a party it was not necessary that Emma should approach her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not wish to speak of the pianoforte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt too much in the secret herself, to think the appearance of curiosity or interest fair, and therefore purposely kept at a distance; but by the others, the subject was almost immediately introduced, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw the blush of consciousness with which congratulations were received, the blush of guilt which accompanied the name of <div class="bookquote">"my excellent friend Colonel Campbell."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston, kind-hearted and musical, was particularly interested by the circumstance, and Emma could not help being amused at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perseverance in dwelling on the subject; and having so much to ask and to say as to tone, touch, and pedal, totally unsuspicious of that wish of saying as little about it as possible, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plainly read in the fair heroine's countenance.

<p/>They were soon joined by some of the gentlemen; and the very first of the early was Frank Churchill. In he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) walked, the first and the handsomest; and after paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) compliments en passant to Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) way directly to the opposite side of the circle, where sat Miss Woodhouse; and till he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could find a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), would not sit at all. Emma divined what every body present must be thinking. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object, and every body must perceive it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, Miss Smith, and, at convenient moments afterwards, heard what each thought of the other. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had never seen so lovely a face, and was delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) na vet ."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>And she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"Only to be sure it was paying him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) too great a compliment, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did think there were some looks a little like Mr. Elton."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Emma restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) indignation, and only turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in silence.

<p/>Smiles of intelligence passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and the gentleman on first glancing towards Miss Fairfax; but it was most prudent to avoid speech. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been impatient to leave the dining-room hated sitting long was always the first to move when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) could that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father, Mr. Knightley, Mr. Cox, and Mr. Cole, were left very busy over parish business that as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had staid, however, it had been pleasant enough, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had found them in general a set of gentlemanlike, sensible men; and spoke so handsomely of Highbury altogether thought it so abundant in agreeable families that Emma began to feel she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been used to despise the place rather too much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) as to the society in Yorkshire the extent of the neighbourhood about Enscombe, and the sort; and could make out from his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) answers that, as far as Enscombe was concerned, there was very little going on, that their visitings were among a range of great families, none very near; and that even when days were fixed, and invitations accepted, it was an even chance that Mrs. Churchill were not in health and spirits for going; that they made a point of visiting no fresh person; and that, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) had his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) separate engagements, it was not without difficulty, without considerable address at times, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) could get away, or introduce an acquaintance for a night.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw that Enscombe could not satisfy, and that Highbury, taken at its best, might reasonably please a young man who had more retirement at home than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) liked. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) importance at Enscombe was very evident. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not boast, but it naturally betrayed itself, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had persuaded his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt where his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle could do nothing, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) laughing and noticing it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) owned that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed (excepting one or two points) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could with time persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to any thing. One of those points on which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) influence failed, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) then mentioned. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had wanted very much to go abroad had been very eager indeed to be allowed to travel but she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) would not hear of it. This had happened the year before. Now, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was beginning to have no longer the same wish.

<p/>The unpersuadable point, which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not mention, Emma guessed to be good behaviour to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have made a most wretched discovery,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), after a short pause.  "I have been here a week to-morrow half my time. I never knew days fly so fast. A week to-morrow! And I have hardly begun to enjoy myself. But just got acquainted with Mrs. Weston, and others! I hate the recollection."

<p/>"Perhaps you may now begin to regret that you spent one whole day, out of so few, in having your hair cut."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), smiling, "that is no subject of regret at all. I have no pleasure in seeing my friends, unless I can believe myself fit to be seen."

<p/>The rest of the gentlemen being now in the room, Emma found herself obliged to turn from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for a few minutes, and listen to Mr. Cole. When Mr. Cole had moved away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention could be restored as before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Frank Churchill looking intently across the room at Miss Fairfax, who was sitting exactly opposite.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What is the matter?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) started. <div class="bookquote">"Thank you for rousing me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied. "I believe I have been very rude; but really Miss Fairfax has done her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hair in so odd a way so very odd a way that I cannot keep my eyes from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). I never saw any thing so outr e! Those curls! This must be a fancy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own. I see nobody else looking like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)! I must go and ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) whether it is an Irish fashion. Shall I? Yes, I will I declare I will and you shall see how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) takes it; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) colours."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone immediately; and Emma soon saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) standing before Miss Fairfax, and talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but as to its effect on the young lady, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had improvidently placed himself exactly between them, exactly in front of Miss Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could absolutely distinguish nothing.

<p/>Before he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) chair, it was taken by Mrs. Weston.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is the luxury of a large party,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>): "one can get near every body, and say every thing. My dear Emma, I am longing to talk to you. I have been making discoveries and forming plans, just like yourself, and I must tell them while the idea is fresh. Do you know how Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece came here?"

<p/>"How? They were invited, were not they?"

<p/>"Oh! yes but how they were conveyed hither? the manner of their coming?"

<p/>"They walked, I conclude. How else could they come?"

<p/>"Very true. Well, a little while ago it occurred to me how very sad it would be to have Jane Fairfax walking home again, late at night, and cold as the nights are now. And as I looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), though I never saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) appear to more advantage, it struck me that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was heated, and would therefore be particularly liable to take cold. Poor girl! I could not bear the idea of it; so, as soon as Mr. Weston came into the room, and I could get at him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) about the carriage. You may guess how readily he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came into my wishes; and having his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, I made my way directly to Miss Bates, to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) that the carriage would be at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) service before it took us home; for I thought it would be making her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) comfortable at once. Good soul! she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was as grateful as possible, you may be sure. <div class="bookquote">'Nobody was ever so fortunate as herself!'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>but with many, many thanks 'there was no occasion to trouble us, for Mr. Knightley's carriage had brought, and was to take them home again.' I was quite surprized; very glad, I am sure; but really quite surprized. Such a very kind attention and so thoughtful an attention! the sort of thing that so few men would think of. And, in short, from knowing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) usual ways, I am very much inclined to think that it was for their accommodation the carriage was used at all. I do suspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not have had a pair of horses for himself, and that it was only as an excuse for assisting them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very likely,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma "nothing more likely. I know no man more likely than Mr. Knightley to do the sort of thing to do any thing really good-natured, useful, considerate, or benevolent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is not a gallant man, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a very humane one; and this, considering Jane Fairfax's ill-health, would appear a case of humanity to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and for an act of unostentatious kindness, there is nobody whom I would fix on more than on Mr. Knightley. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had horses to-day for we arrived together; and I laughed at him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) about it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said not a word that could betray."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, smiling, "you give him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) credit for more simple, disinterested benevolence in this instance than I do; for while Miss Bates was speaking, a suspicion darted into my head, and I have never been able to get it out again. The more I think of it, the more probable it appears. In short, I have made a match between Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax. See the consequence of keeping you company! What do you say to it?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Mr. Knightley and Jane Fairfax!<div class="bookquote">" exclaimed Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>Dear Mrs. Weston, how could you think of such a thing? Mr. Knightley! Mr. Knightley must not marry! You would not have little Henry cut out from Donwell? Oh! no, no, Henry must have Donwell. I cannot at all consent to Mr. Knightley's marrying; and I am sure it is not at all likely. I am amazed that you should think of such a thing."

<p/>"My dear Emma, I have told you what led me to think of it. I do not want the match I do not want to injure dear little Henry but the idea has been given me by circumstances; and if Mr. Knightley really wished to marry, you would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) refrain on Henry's account, a boy of six years old, who knows nothing of the matter?"

<p/>"Yes, I would. I could not bear to have Henry supplanted. Mr. Knightley marry! No, I have never had such an idea, and I cannot adopt it now. And Jane Fairfax, too, of all women!"

<p/>"Nay, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has always been a first favourite with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), as you very well know."

<p/>"But the imprudence of such a match!"

<p/>"I am not speaking of its prudence; merely its probability."

<p/>"I see no probability in it, unless you have any better foundation than what you mention. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good-nature, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) humanity, as I tell you, would be quite enough to account for the horses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has a great regard for the Bateses, you know, independent of Jane Fairfax and is always glad to shew them attention. My dear Mrs. Weston, do not take to match-making. You do it very ill. Jane Fairfax mistress of the Abbey! Oh! no, no; every feeling revolts. For his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own sake, I would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) do so mad a thing."

<p/>"Imprudent, if you please but not mad. Excepting inequality of fortune, and perhaps a little disparity of age, I can see nothing unsuitable."

<p/>"But Mr. Knightley does not want to marry. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not the least idea of it. Do not put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head. Why should he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) marry? He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is as happy as possible by himself; with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) farm, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sheep, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) library, and all the parish to manage; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is extremely fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's children. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has no occasion to marry, either to fill up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) time or his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) heart."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Emma, as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thinks so, it is so; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really loves Jane Fairfax "

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>"Nonsense! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not care about Jane Fairfax. In the way of love, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would do any good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) family; but "

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, laughing, "perhaps the greatest good he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could do them, would be to give Jane such a respectable home."

<p/>"If it would be good to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), I am sure it would be evil to himself; a very shameful and degrading connexion. How would he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) bear to have Miss Bates belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)? To have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) haunting the Abbey, and thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) all day long for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great kindness in marrying Jane? 'So very kind and obliging! But he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always had been such a very kind neighbour!<div class="bookquote">' And then fly off, through half a sentence, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother's old petticoat. ' (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Not that it was such a very old petticoat either for still it would last a great while and, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must thankfully say that their petticoats were all very strong.'"

<p/>"For shame, Emma! Do not mimic her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). You divert me against my conscience. And, upon my word, I do not think Mr. Knightley would be much disturbed by Miss Bates. Little things do not irritate him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) might talk on; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to say any thing himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would only talk louder, and drown her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) voice. But the question is not, whether it would be a bad connexion for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), but whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wishes it; and I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does. I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) speak, and so must you, so very highly of Jane Fairfax! The interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) takes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anxiety about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) health his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) concern that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should have no happier prospect! I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) express himself so warmly on those points! Such an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) performance on the pianoforte, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voice! I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) for ever. Oh! and I had almost forgotten one idea that occurred to me this pianoforte that has been sent here by somebody though we have all been so well satisfied to consider it a present from the Campbells, may it not be from Mr. Knightley? I cannot help suspecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is just the person to do it, even without being in love."

<p/>"Then it can be no argument to prove that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is in love. But I do not think it is at all a likely thing for him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to do. Mr. Knightley does nothing mysteriously."

<p/>"I have heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lamenting her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having no instrument repeatedly; oftener than I should suppose such a circumstance would, in the common course of things, occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)."

<p/>"Very well; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had intended to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) one, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have told her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) so."

<p/>"There might be scruples of delicacy, my dear Emma. I have a very strong notion that it comes from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was particularly silent when Mrs. Cole told us of it at dinner."

<p/>"You take up an idea, Mrs. Weston, and run away with it; as you have many a time reproached me with doing. I see no sign of attachment I believe nothing of the pianoforte and proof only shall convince me that Mr. Knightley has any thought of marrying Jane Fairfax."

<p/>They combated the point some time longer in the same way; Emma rather gaining ground over the mind of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend; for Mrs. Weston was the most used of the two to yield; till a little bustle in the room shewed them that tea was over, and the instrument in preparation; and at the same moment Mr. Cole approaching to entreat Miss Woodhouse would do them the honour of trying it. Frank Churchill, of whom, in the eagerness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) conversation with Mrs. Weston, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been seeing nothing, except that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had found a seat by Miss Fairfax, followed Mr. Cole, to add his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) very pressing entreaties; and as, in every respect, it suited Emma best to lead, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a very proper compliance.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew the limitations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers too well to attempt more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could perform with credit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted neither taste nor spirit in the little things which are generally acceptable, and could accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own voice well. One accompaniment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) song took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agreeably by surprize a second, slightly but correctly taken by Frank Churchill. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pardon was duly begged at the close of the song, and every thing usual followed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was accused of having a delightful voice, and a perfect knowledge of music; which was properly denied; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knew nothing of the matter, and had no voice at all, roundly asserted. They sang together once more; and Emma would then resign her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) place to Miss Fairfax, whose performance, both vocal and instrumental, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) never could attempt to conceal from herself, was infinitely superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own.

<p/>With mixed feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seated herself at a little distance from the numbers round the instrument, to listen. Frank Churchill sang again. They had sung together once or twice, it appeared, at Weymouth. But the sight of Mr. Knightley among the most attentive, soon drew away half Emma's mind; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fell into a train of thinking on the subject of Mrs. Weston's suspicions, to which the sweet sounds of the united voices gave only momentary interruptions. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) objections to Mr. Knightley's marrying did not in the least subside. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could see nothing but evil in it. It would be a great disappointment to Mr. John Knightley; consequently to Isabella. A real injury to the children a most mortifying change, and material loss to them all; a very great deduction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father's daily comfort and, as to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not at all endure the idea of Jane Fairfax at Donwell Abbey. A Mrs. Knightley for them all to give way to! No Mr. Knightley must never marry. Little Henry must remain the heir of Donwell.

<p/>Presently Mr. Knightley looked back, and came and sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). They talked at first only of the performance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) admiration was certainly very warm; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) thought, but for Mrs. Weston, it would not have struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). As a sort of touchstone, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to speak of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) kindness in conveying the aunt and niece; and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answer was in the spirit of cutting the matter short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed it to indicate only his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disinclination to dwell on any kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I often feel concern,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), "that I dare not make our carriage more useful on such occasions. It is not that I am without the wish; but you know how impossible my father would deem it that James should put-to for such a purpose."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Quite out of the question, quite out of the question,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) replied; "but you must often wish it, I am sure.<div class="bookquote">" And he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) smiled with such seeming pleasure at the conviction, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must proceed another step.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Campbells</b></font>)</div>This present from the Campbells," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) "this pianoforte is very kindly given."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) replied, and without the smallest apparent embarrassment. "But they would have done better had they given her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) notice of it. Surprizes are foolish things. The pleasure is not enhanced, and the inconvenience is often considerable. I should have expected better judgment in Colonel Campbell."

<p/>From that moment, Emma could have taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) oath that Mr. Knightley had had no concern in giving the instrument. But whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were entirely free from peculiar attachment whether there were no actual preference remained a little longer doubtful. Towards the end of Jane's second song, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) voice grew thick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That will do,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), when it was finished, thinking aloud "you have sung quite enough for one evening now be quiet."

<p/>Another song, however, was soon begged for. <div class="bookquote">"One more; they would not fatigue Miss Fairfax on any account, and would only ask for one more."  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>And Frank Churchill was heard to say, "I think you could manage this without effort; the first part is so very trifling. The strength of the song falls on the second.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Knightley grew angry.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>That fellow</b></font>)</div>That fellow," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), indignantly, "thinks of nothing but shewing off his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own voice. This must not be." And touching Miss Bates, who at that moment passed near "Miss Bates, are you mad, to let your niece sing herself hoarse in this manner? Go, and interfere. They have no mercy on her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)."

<p/>Miss Bates, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) real anxiety for Jane, could hardly stay even to be grateful, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) stept forward and put an end to all farther singing. Here ceased the concert part of the evening, for Miss Woodhouse and Miss Fairfax were the only young lady performers; but soon (within five minutes) the proposal of dancing originating nobody exactly knew where was so effectually promoted by Mr. and Mrs. Cole, that every thing was rapidly clearing away, to give proper space. Mrs. Weston, capital in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) country-dances, was seated, and beginning an irresistible waltz; and Frank Churchill, coming up with most becoming gallantry to Emma, had secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up to the top.

<p/>While waiting till the other young people could pair themselves off, Emma found time, in spite of the compliments she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was receiving on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste, to look about, and see what became of Mr. Knightley. This would be a trial. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was no dancer in general. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be very alert in engaging Jane Fairfax now, it might augur something. There was no immediate appearance. No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was talking to Mrs. Cole he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was looking on unconcerned; Jane was asked by somebody else, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was still talking to Mrs. Cole.

<p/>Emma had no longer an alarm for Henry; his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) interest was yet safe; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) led off the dance with genuine spirit and enjoyment. Not more than five couple could be mustered; but the rarity and the suddenness of it made it very delightful, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found herself well matched in a partner. They were a couple worth looking at.

<p/>Two dances, unfortunately, were all that could be allowed. It was growing late, and Miss Bates became anxious to get home, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) mother's account. After some attempts, therefore, to be permitted to begin again, they were obliged to thank Mrs. Weston, look sorrowful, and have done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps it is as well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attended Emma to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) carriage. <div class="bookquote">"I must have asked Miss Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) languid dancing would not have agreed with me, after yours."
