<p/>Elizabeth related to Jane the next day what had passed between
Mr. Wickham and herself. Jane listened with astonishment and
concern; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew not how to believe that Mr. Darcy could be so
unworthy of Mr. Bingley’s regard; and yet, it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable
appearance as Wickham. The possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) having endured such
unkindness, was enough to interest all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) tender feelings; and
nothing remained therefore to be done, but to think well of them
both, to defend the conduct of each, and throw into the account
of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They have both,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "been deceived, I dare say, in some
way or other, of which we can form no idea. Interested people
have perhaps misrepresented each to the other. It is, in short,
impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which
may have alienated them, without actual blame on either side."

<p/>"Very true, indeed; and now, my dear Jane, what have you got to
say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been
concerned in the business? Do clear _them_ too, or we shall be
obliged to think ill of somebody."

<p/>"Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my
opinion. My dearest Lizzy, do but consider in what a disgraceful
light it places Mr. Darcy, to be treating his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father’s favourite
in such a manner, one whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father had promised to provide
for. It is impossible. No man of common humanity, no man who had
any value for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, could be capable of it. Can his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) most
intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Oh! no."

<p/>"I can much more easily believe Mr. Bingley’s being imposed on,
than that Mr. Wickham should invent such a history of himself as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) gave me last night; names, facts, everything mentioned without
ceremony. If it be not so, let Mr. Darcy contradict it. Besides,
there was truth in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looks."

<p/>"It is difficult indeed—it is distressing. One does not know what
to think."

<p/>"I beg your pardon; one knows exactly what to think."

<p/>But Jane could think with certainty on only one point—that Mr.
Bingley, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) _had been_ imposed on, would have much to suffer
when the affair became public.

<p/>The two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery, where this
conversation passed, by the arrival of the very persons of whom
they had been speaking; Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters came to give
their personal invitation for the long-expected ball at
Netherfield, which was fixed for the following Tuesday. The two
ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again, called it
an age since they had met, and repeatedly asked what she (<font color='blue'><b>ladies</b></font>) had been
doing with herself since their separation. To the rest of the
family they paid little attention; avoiding Mrs. Bennet as much
as possible, saying not much to Elizabeth, and nothing at all to
the others. They were soon gone again, rising from their seats
with an activity which took their brother by surprise, and
hurrying off as if eager to escape from Mrs. Bennet’s civilities.

<p/>The prospect of the Netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to
every female of the family. Mrs. Bennet chose to consider it as
given in compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) eldest daughter, and was particularly
flattered by receiving the invitation from Mr. Bingley himself,
instead of a ceremonious card. Jane pictured to herself a happy
evening in the society of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) two friends, and the attentions of
their brother; and Elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a
great deal with Mr. Wickham, and of seeing a confirmation of
everything in Mr. Darcy’s look and behaviour. The happiness
anticipated by Catherine and Lydia depended less on any single
event, or any particular person, for though they each, like
Elizabeth, meant to dance half the evening with Mr. Wickham, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them, and a
ball was, at any rate, a ball. And even Mary could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
family that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no disinclination for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"While I can have my mornings to myself,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), "it is
enough—I think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening
engagements. Society has claims on us all; and I profess myself
one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement
as desirable for everybody.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth’s spirits were so high on this occasion, that though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not often speak unnecessarily to Mr. Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
not help asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intended to accept Mr. Bingley’s
invitation, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would think it proper to
join in the evening’s amusement; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was rather surprised to
find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) entertained no scruple whatever on that head, and
was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the Archbishop,
or Lady Catherine de Bourgh, by venturing to dance.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am by no means of the opinion, I assure you," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Archbishop</b></font>), "that a
ball of this kind, given by a young man of character, to
respectable people, can have any evil tendency; and I am so far
from objecting to dancing myself, that I shall hope to be
honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of
the evening; and I take this opportunity of soliciting yours,
Miss Elizabeth, for the two first dances especially, a preference
which I trust my cousin Jane will attribute to the right cause,
and not to any disrespect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)."

<p/>Elizabeth felt herself completely taken in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had fully
proposed being engaged by Mr. Wickham for those very dances; and
to have Mr. Collins instead! her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liveliness had never been worse
timed. There was no help for it, however. Mr. Wickham’s happiness
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own were perforce delayed a little longer, and Mr.
Collins’s proposal accepted with as good a grace as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not the better pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) gallantry from the idea
it suggested of something more. It now first struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), that
_she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ was selected from among her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sisters as worthy of being
mistress of Hunsford Parsonage, and of assisting to form a
quadrille table at Rosings, in the absence of more eligible
visitors. The idea soon reached to conviction, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) increasing civilities toward herself, and heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) frequent
attempt at a compliment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wit and vivacity; and though more
astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) charms,
it was not long before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to understand that the
probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_.
Elizabeth, however, did not choose to take the hint, being well
aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any
reply. Mr. Collins might never make the offer, and till he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did,
it was useless to quarrel about him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>).

<p/>If there had not been a Netherfield ball to prepare for and talk
of, the younger Miss Bennets would have been in a very pitiable
state at this time, for from the day of the invitation, to the
day of the ball, there was such a succession of rain as prevented
their walking to Meryton once. No aunt, no officers, no news
could be sought after—the very shoe-roses for Netherfield were
got by proxy. Even Elizabeth might have found some trial of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acquaintance with Mr. Wickham; and nothing less than a dance
on Tuesday, could have made such a Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and
Monday endurable to Kitty and Lydia.
