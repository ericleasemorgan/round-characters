<p/>One thing only was wanting to make the prospect of the ball completely satisfactory to Emma its being fixed for a day within the granted term of Frank Churchill's stay in Surry; for, in spite of Mr. Weston's confidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not think it so very impossible that the Churchills might not allow their nephew to remain a day beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) fortnight. But this was not judged feasible. The preparations must take their time, nothing could be properly ready till the third week were entered on, and for a few days they must be planning, proceeding and hoping in uncertainty at the risk in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion, the great risk, of its being all in vain.

<p/>Enscombe however was gracious, gracious in fact, if not in word. His (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) wish of staying longer evidently did not please; but it was not opposed. All was safe and prosperous; and as the removal of one solicitude generally makes way for another, Emma, being now certain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ball, began to adopt as the next vexation Mr. Knightley's provoking indifference about it. Either because he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not dance himself, or because the plan had been formed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being consulted, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed resolved that it should not interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), determined against its exciting any present curiosity, or affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) any future amusement. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voluntary communications Emma could get no more approving reply, than,

<p/>"Very well. If the Westons think it worth while to be at all this trouble for a few hours of noisy entertainment, I have nothing to say against it, but that they shall not chuse pleasures for me. Oh! yes, I must be there; I could not refuse; and I will keep as much awake as I can; but I would rather be at home, looking over William Larkins's week's account; much rather, I confess. Pleasure in seeing dancing! not I, indeed I never look at it I do not know who does. Fine dancing, I believe, like virtue, must be its own reward. Those who are standing by are usually thinking of something very different."

<p/>This Emma felt was aimed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quite angry. It was not in compliment to Jane Fairfax however that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was so indifferent, or so indignant; he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was not guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) feelings in reprobating the ball, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) enjoyed the thought of it to an extraordinary degree. It made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) animated open hearted she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) voluntarily said;

<p/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, I hope nothing may happen to prevent the ball. What a disappointment it would be! I do look forward to it, I own, with very great pleasure."

<p/>It was not to oblige Jane Fairfax therefore that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would have preferred the society of William Larkins. No! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was more and more convinced that Mrs. Weston was quite mistaken in that surmise. There was a great deal of friendly and of compassionate attachment on his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) side but no love.

<p/>Alas! there was soon no leisure for quarrelling with Mr. Knightley. Two days of joyful security were immediately followed by the over-throw of every thing. A letter arrived from Mr. Churchill to urge his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) nephew's instant return. Mrs. Churchill was unwell far too unwell to do without him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been in a very suffering state (so said her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband) when writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew two days before, though from her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) usual unwillingness to give pain, and constant habit of never thinking of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not mentioned it; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was too ill to trifle, and must entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to set off for Enscombe without delay.

<p/>The substance of this letter was forwarded to Emma, in a note from Mrs. Weston, instantly. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) going, it was inevitable. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) must be gone within a few hours, though without feeling any real alarm for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt, to lessen his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) repugnance. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) illnesses; they never occurred but for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own convenience.

<p/>Mrs. Weston added, <div class="bookquote">"that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) could only allow himself time to hurry to Highbury, after breakfast, and take leave of the few friends there whom he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) could suppose to feel any interest in him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>); and that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) might be expected at Hartfield very soon."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>This wretched note was the finale of Emma's breakfast. When once it had been read, there was no doing any thing, but lament and exclaim. The loss of the ball the loss of the young man and all that the young man might be feeling! It was too wretched! Such a delightful evening as it would have been! Every body so happy! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) partner the happiest! <div class="bookquote">"I said it would be so,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the only consolation.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's feelings were quite distinct. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought principally of Mrs. Churchill's illness, and wanted to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was treated; and as for the ball, it was shocking to have dear Emma disappointed; but they would all be safer at home.

<p/>Emma was ready for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visitor some time before he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) appeared; but if this reflected at all upon his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) impatience, his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sorrowful look and total want of spirits when he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) did come might redeem him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt the going away almost too much to speak of it. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) dejection was most evident. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) sat really lost in thought for the first few minutes; and when rousing himself, it was only to say,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Of all horrid things, leave-taking is the worst."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"But you will come again,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. <div class="bookquote">"This will not be your only visit to Randalls."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Ah! (shaking his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) head) the uncertainty of when I may be able to return! I shall try for it with a zeal! It will be the object of all my thoughts and cares! and if my uncle and aunt go to town this spring but I am afraid they did not stir last spring I am afraid it is a custom gone for ever."

<p/>"Our poor ball must be quite given up."

<p/>"Ah! that ball! why did we wait for any thing? why not seize the pleasure at once? How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation! You told us it would be so. Oh! Miss Woodhouse, why are you always so right?"

<p/>"Indeed, I am very sorry to be right in this instance. I would much rather have been merry than wise."

<p/>"If I can come again, we are still to have our ball. My father depends on it. Do not forget your engagement.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma looked graciously.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such a fortnight as it has been!" he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued; "every day more precious and more delightful than the day before! every day making me less fit to bear any other place. Happy those, who can remain at Highbury!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As you do us such ample justice now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing, "I will venture to ask, whether you did not come a little doubtfully at first? Do not we rather surpass your expectations? I am sure we do. I am sure you did not much expect to like us. You would not have been so long in coming, if you had had a pleasant idea of Highbury.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) laughed rather consciously; and though denying the sentiment, Emma was convinced that it had been so.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And you must be off this very morning?"

<p/>"Yes; my father is to join me here: we shall walk back together, and I must be off immediately. I am almost afraid that every moment will bring him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)."

<p/>"Not five minutes to spare even for your friends Miss Fairfax and Miss Bates? How unlucky! Miss Bates's powerful, argumentative mind might have strengthened yours."

<p/>"Yes I have called there; passing the door, I thought it better. It was a right thing to do. I went in for three minutes, and was detained by Miss Bates's being absent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was out; and I felt it impossible not to wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) came in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a woman that one may, that one must laugh at; but that one would not wish to slight. It was better to pay my visit, then<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) hesitated, got up, walked to a window.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>In short," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"perhaps, Miss Woodhouse I think you can hardly be quite without suspicion"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), as if wanting to read her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hardly knew what to say. It seemed like the forerunner of something absolutely serious, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not wish. Forcing herself to speak, therefore, in the hope of putting it by, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) calmly said,

<p/>"You are quite in the right; it was most natural to pay your visit, then"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was silent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); probably reflecting on what she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had said, and trying to understand the manner. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) sigh. It was natural for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had cause to sigh. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) could not believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to be encouraging him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). A few awkward moments passed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) sat down again; and in a more determined manner said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It was something to feel that all the rest of my time might be given to Hartfield. My regard for Hartfield is most warm"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) stopt again, rose again, and seemed quite embarrassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was more in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) than Emma had supposed; and who can say how it might have ended, if his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) father had not made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) appearance? Mr. Woodhouse soon followed; and the necessity of exertion made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) composed.

<p/>A very few minutes more, however, completed the present trial. Mr. Weston, always alert when business was to be done, and as incapable of procrastinating any evil that was inevitable, as of foreseeing any that was doubtful, said, <div class="bookquote">"It was time to go;"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>and the young man, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might and did sigh, could not but agree, to take leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall hear about you all,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); "that is my chief consolation. I shall hear of every thing that is going on among you. I have engaged Mrs. Weston to correspond with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has been so kind as to promise it. Oh! the blessing of a female correspondent, when one is really interested in the absent! she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will tell me every thing. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) letters I shall be at dear Highbury again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>A very friendly shake of the hand, a very earnest " (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>Good-bye," closed the speech, and the door had soon shut out Frank Churchill. Short had been the notice short their meeting; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone; and Emma felt so sorry to part, and foresaw so great a loss to their little society from his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) absence as to begin to be afraid of being too sorry, and feeling it too much.

<p/>It was a sad change. They had been meeting almost every day since his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) arrival. Certainly his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) being at Randalls had given great spirit to the last two weeks indescribable spirit; the idea, the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) which every morning had brought, the assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) liveliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manners! It had been a very happy fortnight, and forlorn must be the sinking from it into the common course of Hartfield days. To complete every other recommendation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had almost told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). What strength, or what constancy of affection he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) might be subject to, was another point; but at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) having a decidedly warm admiration, a conscious preference of herself; and this persuasion, joined to all the rest, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) must be a little in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), in spite of every previous determination against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I certainly must,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). "This sensation of listlessness, weariness, stupidity, this disinclination to sit down and employ myself, this feeling of every thing's being dull and insipid about the house!  I must be in love; I should be the oddest creature in the world if I were not for a few weeks at least. Well! evil to some is always good to others. I shall have many fellow-mourners for the ball, if not for Frank Churchill; but Mr. Knightley will be happy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) may spend the evening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) dear William Larkins now if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) likes."

<p/>Mr. Knightley, however, shewed no triumphant happiness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was sorry on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own account; his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) very cheerful look would have contradicted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) said, and very steadily, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was sorry for the disappointment of the others, and with considerable kindness added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You, Emma, who have so few opportunities of dancing, you are really out of luck; you are very much out of luck!"

 (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div><p/>It was some days before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw Jane Fairfax, to judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) honest regret in this woeful change; but when they did meet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) composure was odious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been particularly unwell, however, suffering from headache to a degree, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt declare, that had the ball taken place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did not think Jane could have attended it; and it was charity to impute some of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unbecoming indifference to the languor of ill-health.
