<p/>Though Mrs. Jennings was in the habit of spending a large portion of
the year at the houses of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) children and friends, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was not without
a settled habitation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own. Since the death of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) husband, who
had traded with success in a less elegant part of the town, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had
resided every winter in a house in one of the streets near Portman
Square. Towards this home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) began on the approach of January to turn
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and thither she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one day abruptly, and very unexpectedly
by them, asked the elder Misses Dashwood to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). Elinor,
without observing the varying complexion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and the
animated look which spoke no indifference to the plan, immediately gave
a grateful but absolute denial for both, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed herself
to be speaking their united inclinations. The reason alleged was their
determined resolution of not leaving their mother at that time of the
year. Mrs. Jennings received the refusal with some surprise, and
repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) invitation immediately.

<p/>"Oh, Lord! I am sure your mother can spare you very well, and I _do_
beg you will favour me with your company, for I’ve quite set my heart
upon it. Don’t fancy that you will be any inconvenience to me, for I
shan’t put myself at all out of my way for you. It will only be sending
Betty by the coach, and I hope I can afford _that_. We three shall be
able to go very well in my chaise; and when we are in town, if you do
not like to go wherever I do, well and good, you may always go with one
of my daughters. I am sure your mother will not object to it; for I
have had such good luck in getting my own children off my hands that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will think me a very fit person to have the charge of you; and if I
don’t get one of you at least well married before I have done with you,
it shall not be my fault. I shall speak a good word for you to all the
young men, you may depend upon it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have a notion,"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, "that Miss Marianne would not object
to such a scheme, if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) elder sister would come into it. It is very
hard indeed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should not have a little pleasure, because Miss
Dashwood does not wish it. So I would advise you two, to set off for
town, when you are tired of Barton, without saying a word to Miss
Dashwood about it."

<p/>"Nay," cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure I shall be monstrous glad of
Miss Marianne’s company, whether Miss Dashwood will go or not, only the
more the merrier say I, and I thought it would be more comfortable for
them to be together; because, if they got tired of me, they might talk
to one another, and laugh at my odd ways behind my back. But one or the
other, if not both of them, I must have. Lord bless me! how do you
think I can live poking by myself, I who have been always used till
this winter to have Charlotte with me. Come, Miss Marianne, let us
strike hands upon the bargain, and if Miss Dashwood will change her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
mind by and bye, why so much the better."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I thank you, ma’am, sincerely thank you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, with warmth:
"your invitation has insured my gratitude for ever, and it would give
me such happiness, yes, almost the greatest happiness I am capable of,
to be able to accept it. But my mother, my dearest, kindest mother,—I
feel the justice of what Elinor has urged, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) were to be made
less happy, less comfortable by our absence—Oh! no, nothing should
tempt me to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). It should not, must not be a struggle."

<p/>Mrs. Jennings repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) assurance that Mrs. Dashwood could spare
them perfectly well; and Elinor, who now understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, and saw
to what indifference to almost every thing else she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was carried by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
eagerness to be with Willoughby again, made no farther direct
opposition to the plan, and merely referred it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s
decision, from whom however she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) scarcely expected to receive any
support in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) endeavour to prevent a visit, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not
approve of for Marianne, and which on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own account she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
particular reasons to avoid. Whatever Marianne was desirous of, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother would be eager to promote—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not expect to influence the
latter to cautiousness of conduct in an affair respecting which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
never been able to inspire her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with distrust; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not explain
the motive of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disinclination for going to London. That
Marianne, fastidious as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was, thoroughly acquainted with Mrs.
Jennings’ manners, and invariably disgusted by them, should overlook
every inconvenience of that kind, should disregard whatever must be
most wounding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) irritable feelings, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pursuit of one object,
was such a proof, so strong, so full, of the importance of that object
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), as Elinor, in spite of all that had passed, was not prepared to
witness.

<p/>On being informed of the invitation, Mrs. Dashwood, persuaded that such
an excursion would be productive of much amusement to both her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughters, and perceiving through all her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) affectionate attention to
herself, how much the heart of Marianne was in it, would not hear of
their declining the offer upon _her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ account; insisted on their both
accepting it directly; and then began to foresee, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual
cheerfulness, a variety of advantages that would accrue to them all,
from this separation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am delighted with the plan,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cried, "it is exactly what I could
wish. Margaret and I shall be as much benefited by it as yourselves.
When you and the Middletons are gone, we shall go on so quietly and
happily together with our books and our music! You will find Margaret
so improved when you come back again! I have a little plan of
alteration for your bedrooms too, which may now be performed without
any inconvenience to any one. It is very right that you _should_ go to
town; I would have every young woman of your condition in life
acquainted with the manners and amusements of London. You will be under
the care of a motherly good sort of woman, of whose kindness to you I
can have no doubt. And in all probability you will see your brother,
and whatever may be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) faults, or the faults of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, when I
consider whose son he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is, I cannot bear to have you so wholly estranged
from each other."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Though with your usual anxiety for our happiness,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "you
have been obviating every impediment to the present scheme which
occurred to you, there is still one objection which, in my opinion,
cannot be so easily removed.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne’s countenance sunk.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>And what," said Mrs. Dashwood, "is my dear prudent Elinor going to
suggest? What formidable obstacle is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now to bring forward? Do not
let me hear a word about the expense of it."

<p/>"My objection is this; though I think very well of Mrs. Jennings’s
heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is not a woman whose society can afford us pleasure, or
whose protection will give us consequence."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother, "but of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) society,
separately from that of other people, you will scarcely have any thing
at all, and you will almost always appear in public with Lady
Middleton."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If Elinor is frightened away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dislike of Mrs. Jennings,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said
Marianne, "at least it need not prevent MY accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) invitation. I
have no such scruples, and I am sure I could put up with every
unpleasantness of that kind with very little effort."

<p/>Elinor could not help smiling at this display of indifference towards
the manners of a person, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had often had difficulty in
persuading Marianne to behave with tolerable politeness; and resolved
within herself, that if her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister persisted in going, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would go
likewise, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not think it proper that Marianne should be left
to the sole guidance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own judgment, or that Mrs. Jennings should
be abandoned to the mercy of Marianne for all the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
domestic hours. To this determination she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was the more easily
reconciled, by recollecting that Edward Ferrars, by Lucy’s account, was
not to be in town before February; and that their visit, without any
unreasonable abridgement, might be previously finished.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will have you _both_ go,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood; "these objections are
nonsensical. You will have much pleasure in being in London, and
especially in being together; and if Elinor would ever condescend to
anticipate enjoyment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would foresee it there from a variety of
sources; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would, perhaps, expect some from improving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister-in-law’s family."

<p/>Elinor had often wished for an opportunity of attempting to weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother’s dependence on the attachment of Edward and herself, that the
shock might be less when the whole truth were revealed, and now on this
attack, though almost hopeless of success, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forced herself to begin
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) design by saying, as calmly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could, "I like Edward Ferrars
very much, and shall always be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>); but as to the rest of
the family, it is a matter of perfect indifference to me, whether I am
ever known to them or not."

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood smiled, and said nothing. Marianne lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes in
astonishment, and Elinor conjectured that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might as well have held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>After very little farther discourse, it was finally settled that the
invitation should be fully accepted. Mrs. Jennings received the
information with a great deal of joy, and many assurances of kindness
and care; nor was it a matter of pleasure merely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>). Sir John was
delighted; for to a man, whose prevailing anxiety was the dread of
being alone, the acquisition of two, to the number of inhabitants in
London, was something. Even Lady Middleton took the trouble of being
delighted, which was putting herself rather out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) way; and as for
the Miss Steeles, especially Lucy, they had never been so happy in
their lives as this intelligence made them.

<p/>Elinor submitted to the arrangement which counteracted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wishes with
less reluctance than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had expected to feel. With regard to herself,
it was now a matter of unconcern whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went to town or not, and
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother so thoroughly pleased with the plan, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister exhilarated by it in look, voice, and manner, restored to all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual animation, and elevated to more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual gaiety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not be dissatisfied with the cause, and would hardly allow
herself to distrust the consequence.

<p/>Marianne’s joy was almost a degree beyond happiness, so great was the
perturbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be gone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
unwillingness to quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only restorative to calmness;
and at the moment of parting her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) grief on that score was excessive. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother’s affliction was hardly less, and Elinor was the only one of the
three, who seemed to consider the separation as any thing short of
eternal.

<p/>Their departure took place in the first week in January. The Middletons
were to follow in about a week. The Miss Steeles kept their station at
the park, and were to quit it only with the rest of the family.
