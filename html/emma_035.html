<p/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room after dinner, Emma found it hardly possible to prevent their making two distinct parties; with so much perseverance in judging and behaving ill did Mrs. Elton engross Jane Fairfax and slight herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were obliged to be almost always either talking together or silent together. Mrs. Elton left them no choice. If Jane repressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for a little time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon began again; and though much that passed between them was in a half-whisper, especially on Mrs. Elton's side, there was no avoiding a knowledge of their principal subjects: The post-office catching cold fetching letters and friendship, were long under discussion; and to them succeeded one, which must be at least equally unpleasant to Jane inquiries whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had yet heard of any situation likely to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and professions of Mrs. Elton's meditated activity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Here is April come!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), "I get quite anxious about you. June will soon be here."

<p/>"But I have never fixed on June or any other month merely looked forward to the summer in general."

<p/>"But have you really heard of nothing?"

<p/>"I have not even made any inquiry; I do not wish to make any yet."

<p/>"Oh! my dear, we cannot begin too early; you are not aware of the difficulty of procuring exactly the desirable thing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I not aware!"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head; "dear Mrs. Elton, who can have thought of it as I have done?"

<p/>"But you have not seen so much of the world as I have. You do not know how many candidates there always are for the first situations. I saw a vast deal of that in the neighbourhood round Maple Grove. A cousin of Mr. Suckling, Mrs. Bragge, had such an infinity of applications; every body was anxious to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) family, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bragge</b></font>) moves in the first circle. Wax-candles in the schoolroom! You may imagine how desirable! Of all houses in the kingdom Mrs. Bragge's is the one I would most wish to see you in."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Colonel and Mrs. Campbell are to be in town again by midsummer,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane. "I must spend some time with them; I am sure they will want it; afterwards I may probably be glad to dispose of myself. But I would not wish you to take the trouble of making any inquiries at present."

<p/>"Trouble! aye, I know your scruples. You are afraid of giving me trouble; but I assure you, my dear Jane, the Campbells can hardly be more interested about you than I am. I shall write to Mrs. Partridge in a day or two, and shall give her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>) a strict charge to be on the look-out for any thing eligible."

<p/>"Thank you, but I would rather you did not mention the subject to her (<font color='blue'><b>Partridge</b></font>); till the time draws nearer, I do not wish to be giving any body trouble."

<p/>"But, my dear child, the time is drawing near; here is April, and June, or say even July, is very near, with such business to accomplish before us. Your inexperience really amuses me! A situation such as you deserve, and your friends would require for you, is no everyday occurrence, is not obtained at a moment's notice; indeed, indeed, we must begin inquiring directly."

<p/>"Excuse me, ma'am, but this is by no means my intention; I make no inquiry myself, and should be sorry to have any made by my friends. When I am quite determined as to the time, I am not at all afraid of being long unemployed. There are places in town, offices, where inquiry would soon produce something Offices for the sale not quite of human flesh but of human intellect."

<p/>"Oh! my dear, human flesh! You quite shock me; if you mean a fling at the slave-trade, I assure you Mr. Suckling was always rather a friend to the abolition."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I did not mean, I was not thinking of the slave-trade,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane; "governess-trade, I assure you, was all that I had in view; widely different certainly as to the guilt of those who carry it on; but as to the greater misery of the victims, I do not know where it lies. But I only mean to say that there are advertising offices, and that by applying to them I should have no doubt of very soon meeting with something that would do."

<p/>"Something that would do!<div class="bookquote">" repeated Mrs. Elton. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Aye, that may suit your humble ideas of yourself; I know what a modest creature you are; but it will not satisfy your friends to have you taking up with any thing that may offer, any inferior, commonplace situation, in a family not moving in a certain circle, or able to command the elegancies of life."

<p/>"You are very obliging; but as to all that, I am very indifferent; it would be no object to me to be with the rich; my mortifications, I think, would only be the greater; I should suffer more from comparison. A gentleman's family is all that I should condition for."

<p/>"I know you, I know you; you would take up with any thing; but I shall be a little more nice, and I am sure the good Campbells will be quite on my side; with your superior talents, you have a right to move in the first circle. Your musical knowledge alone would entitle you to name your own terms, have as many rooms as you like, and mix in the family as much as you chose; that is I do not know if you knew the harp, you might do all that, I am very sure; but you sing as well as play; yes, I really believe you might, even without the harp, stipulate for what you chose; and you must and shall be delightfully, honourably and comfortably settled before the Campbells or I have any rest."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may well class the delight, the honour, and the comfort of such a situation together,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, "they are pretty sure to be equal; however, I am very serious in not wishing any thing to be attempted at present for me. I am exceedingly obliged to you, Mrs. Elton, I am obliged to any body who feels for me, but I am quite serious in wishing nothing to be done till the summer. For two or three months longer I shall remain where I am, and as I am."

<p/>"And I am quite serious too, I assure you,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs. Elton gaily, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>in resolving to be always on the watch, and employing my friends to watch also, that nothing really unexceptionable may pass us."

<p/>In this style she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ran on; never thoroughly stopped by any thing till Mr. Woodhouse came into the room; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) vanity had then a change of object, and Emma heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saying in the same half-whisper to Jane,

<p/>"Here comes this dear old beau of mine, I protest! Only think of his (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) gallantry in coming away before the other men! what a dear creature he (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) is; I assure you I like him (<font color='blue'><b>beau</b></font>) excessively. I admire all that quaint, old-fashioned politeness; it is much more to my taste than modern ease; modern ease often disgusts me. But this good old Mr. Woodhouse, I wish you had heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) gallant speeches to me at dinner. Oh! I assure you I began to think my caro sposo would be absolutely jealous. I fancy I am rather a favourite; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) took notice of my gown. How do you like it? Selina's choice handsome, I think, but I do not know whether it is not over-trimmed; I have the greatest dislike to the idea of being over-trimmed quite a horror of finery. I must put on a few ornaments now, because it is expected of me. A bride, you know, must appear like a bride, but my natural taste is all for simplicity; a simple style of dress is so infinitely preferable to finery. But I am quite in the minority, I believe; few people seem to value simplicity of dress, show and finery are every thing. I have some notion of putting such a trimming as this to my white and silver poplin. Do you think it will look well?"

<p/>The whole party were but just reassembled in the drawing-room when Mr. Weston made his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) appearance among them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner, and walked to Hartfield as soon as it was over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been too much expected by the best judges, for surprize but there was great joy. Mr. Woodhouse was almost as glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) now, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have been sorry to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) before. John Knightley only was in mute astonishment. That a man who might have spent his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) evening quietly at home after a day of business in London, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man's house, for the sake of being in mixed company till bed-time, of finishing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) day in the efforts of civility and the noise of numbers, was a circumstance to strike him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deeply. A man who had been in motion since eight o'clock in the morning, and might now have been still, who had been long talking, and might have been silent, who had been in more than one crowd, and might have been alone! Such a man, to quit the tranquillity and independence of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own fireside, and on the evening of a cold sleety April day rush out again into the world! Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) finger have instantly taken back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife, there would have been a motive; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming would probably prolong rather than break up the party. John Knightley looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with amazement, then shrugged his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shoulders, and said, <div class="bookquote">"I could not have believed it even of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Weston meanwhile, perfectly unsuspicious of the indignation he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was exciting, happy and cheerful as usual, and with all the right of being principal talker, which a day spent anywhere from home confers, was making himself agreeable among the rest; and having satisfied the inquiries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dinner, convincing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) that none of all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) careful directions to the servants had been forgotten, and spread abroad what public news he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had heard, was proceeding to a family communication, which, though principally addressed to Mrs. Weston, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not the smallest doubt of being highly interesting to every body in the room. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a letter, it was from Frank, and to herself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) had met with it in his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) way, and had taken the liberty of opening it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Read it, read it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"it will give you pleasure; only a few lines will not take you long; read it to Emma."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>The two ladies looked over it together; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) sat smiling and talking to them the whole time, in a voice a little subdued, but very audible to every body.

<p/>"Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is coming, you see; good news, I think. Well, what do you say to it? I always told you he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be here again soon, did not I? Anne, my dear, did not I always tell you so, and you would not believe me? In town next week, you see at the latest, I dare say; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is as impatient as the black gentleman when any thing is to be done; most likely they will be there to-morrow or Saturday. As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) illness, all nothing of course. But it is an excellent thing to have Frank among us again, so near as town. They will stay a good while when they do come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be half his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) time with us. This is precisely what I wanted. Well, pretty good news, is not it? Have you finished it? Has Emma read it all? Put it up, put it up; we will have a good talk about it some other time, but it will not do now. I shall only just mention the circumstance to the others in a common way."

<p/>Mrs. Weston was most comfortably pleased on the occasion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) looks and words had nothing to restrain them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was happy, and knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be happy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) congratulations were warm and open; but Emma could not speak so fluently. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was a little occupied in weighing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own feelings, and trying to understand the degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) agitation, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather thought was considerable.

<p/>Mr. Weston, however, too eager to be very observant, too communicative to want others to talk, was very well satisfied with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did say, and soon moved away to make the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends happy by a partial communication of what the whole room must have overheard already.

<p/>It was well that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took every body's joy for granted, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not have thought either Mr. Woodhouse or Mr. Knightley particularly delighted. They were the first entitled, after Mrs. Weston and Emma, to be made happy; from them he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have proceeded to Miss Fairfax, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so deep in conversation with John Knightley, that it would have been too positive an interruption; and finding himself close to Mrs. Elton, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attention disengaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) necessarily began on the subject with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).
