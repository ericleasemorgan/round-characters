<p/>Edmund had determined that it belonged entirely to Fanny to chuse
whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation with regard to Crawford should be mentioned
between them or not; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not lead the way, it should
never be touched on by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); but after a day or two of mutual reserve,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was induced by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind, and try what his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
influence might do for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend.

<p/>A day, and a very early day, was actually fixed for the Crawfords’
departure; and Sir Thomas thought it might be as well to make one more
effort for the young man before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left Mansfield, that all his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
professions and vows of unshaken attachment might have as much hope to
sustain them as possible.

<p/>Sir Thomas was most cordially anxious for the perfection of Mr.
Crawford’s character in that point. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be a model of
constancy; and fancied the best means of effecting it would be by not
trying him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) too long.

<p/>Edmund was not unwilling to be persuaded to engage in the business; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
wanted to know Fanny’s feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) in
every difficulty, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) too well to bear to be denied her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
confidence now; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hoped to be of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must be
of service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); whom else had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to open her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart to? If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did
not need counsel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must need the comfort of communication. Fanny
estranged from him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>), silent and reserved, was an unnatural state of
things; a state which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) must break through, and which he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) could easily
learn to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was wanting him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) to break through.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), sir: I will take the first opportunity of
speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) alone,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>was the result of such thoughts as these; and
upon Sir Thomas’s information of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being at that very time walking
alone in the shrubbery, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) instantly joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am come to walk with you, Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"Shall I?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"It is a long while since we have had a comfortable
walk together."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) assented to it all rather by look than word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits were low.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But, Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) presently added, "in order to have a comfortable walk,
something more is necessary than merely pacing this gravel together.
You must talk to me. I know you have something on your mind. I know
what you are thinking of. You cannot suppose me uninformed. Am I to
hear of it from everybody but Fanny herself?"

<p/>Fanny, at once agitated and dejected, replied, "If you hear of it from
everybody, cousin, there can be nothing for me to tell."

<p/>"Not of facts, perhaps; but of feelings, Fanny. No one but you can tell
me them. I do not mean to press you, however. If it is not what you
wish yourself, I have done. I had thought it might be a relief."

<p/>"I am afraid we think too differently for me to find any relief in
talking of what I feel."

<p/>"Do you suppose that we think differently? I have no idea of it. I dare
say that, on a comparison of our opinions, they would be found as much
alike as they have been used to be: to the point—I consider Crawford’s
proposals as most advantageous and desirable, if you could return his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
affection. I consider it as most natural that all your family should
wish you could return it; but that, as you cannot, you have done
exactly as you ought in refusing him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Can there be any disagreement
between us here?"

<p/>"Oh no! But I thought you blamed me. I thought you were against me.
This is such a comfort!"

<p/>"This comfort you might have had sooner, Fanny, had you sought it. But
how could you possibly suppose me against you? How could you imagine me
an advocate for marriage without love? Were I even careless in general
on such matters, how could you imagine me so where your happiness was
at stake?"

<p/>"My uncle thought me wrong, and I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had been talking to you."

<p/>"As far as you have gone, Fanny, I think you perfectly right. I may be
sorry, I may be surprised—though hardly _that_, for you had not had
time to attach yourself—but I think you perfectly right. Can it admit
of a question? It is disgraceful to us if it does. You did not love
him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); nothing could have justified your accepting him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny had not felt so comfortable for days and days.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So far your conduct has been faultless, and they were quite mistaken
who wished you to do otherwise. But the matter does not end here.
Crawford’s is no common attachment; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) perseveres, with the hope of
creating that regard which had not been created before. This, we know,
must be a work of time. But" (with an affectionate smile) "let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
succeed at last, Fanny, let him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) succeed at last. You have proved
yourself upright and disinterested, prove yourself grateful and
tender-hearted; and then you will be the perfect model of a woman which
I have always believed you born for."

<p/>"Oh! never, never, never! he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) never will succeed with me.<div class="bookquote">" And she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) spoke
with a warmth which quite astonished Edmund, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) blushed at
the recollection of herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) look, and heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
reply, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Never! Fanny!—so very determined and positive! This is not like
yourself, your rational self."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I mean,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, sorrowfully correcting herself, "that I _think_ I
never shall, as far as the future can be answered for; I think I never
shall return his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) regard."

<p/>"I must hope better things. I am aware, more aware than Crawford can
be, that the man who means to make you love him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) (you having due notice
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intentions) must have very uphill work, for there are all your
early attachments and habits in battle array; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can get
your heart for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own use he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has to unfasten it from all the holds
upon things animate and inanimate, which so many years’ growth have
confirmed, and which are considerably tightened for the moment by the
very idea of separation. I know that the apprehension of being forced
to quit Mansfield will for a time be arming you against him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>). I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)
had not been obliged to tell you what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) was trying for. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) had
known you as well as I do, Fanny. Between us, I think we should have
won you. My theoretical and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) practical knowledge together could not
have failed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) should have worked upon my plans. I must hope, however,
that time, proving him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) (as I firmly believe it will) to deserve you by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) steady affection, will give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) reward. I cannot suppose that
you have not the _wish_ to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>)—the natural wish of gratitude. You
must have some feeling of that sort. You must be sorry for your own
indifference."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We are so totally unlike,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, avoiding a direct answer, "we
are so very, very different in all our inclinations and ways, that I
consider it as quite impossible we should ever be tolerably happy
together, even if I _could_ like him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>). There never were two people more
dissimilar. We have not one taste in common. We should be miserable."

<p/>"You are mistaken, Fanny. The dissimilarity is not so strong. You are
quite enough alike. You _have_ tastes in common. You have moral and
literary tastes in common. You have both warm hearts and benevolent
feelings; and, Fanny, who that heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) read, and saw you listen to
Shakespeare the other night, will think you unfitted as companions? You
forget yourself: there is a decided difference in your tempers, I
allow. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) is lively, you are serious; but so much the better: his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)
spirits will support yours. It is your disposition to be easily
dejected and to fancy difficulties greater than they are. His (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>)
cheerfulness will counteract this. He (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) sees difficulties nowhere: and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) pleasantness and gaiety will be a constant support to you. Your
being so far unlike, Fanny, does not in the smallest degree make
against the probability of your happiness together: do not imagine it.
I am myself convinced that it is rather a favourable circumstance. I am
perfectly persuaded that the tempers had better be unlike: I mean
unlike in the flow of the spirits, in the manners, in the inclination
for much or little company, in the propensity to talk or to be silent,
to be grave or to be gay. Some opposition here is, I am thoroughly
convinced, friendly to matrimonial happiness. I exclude extremes, of
course; and a very close resemblance in all those points would be the
likeliest way to produce an extreme. A counteraction, gentle and
continual, is the best safeguard of manners and conduct."

<p/>Full well could Fanny guess where his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts were now: Miss
Crawford’s power was all returning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
cheerfully from the hour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) coming home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) avoiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was quite
at an end. He (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had dined at the Parsonage only the preceding day.

<p/>After leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happier thoughts for some minutes, Fanny,
feeling it due to herself, returned to Mr. Crawford, and said, "It is
not merely in _temper_ that I consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) as totally unsuited to
myself; though, in _that_ respect, I think the difference between us
too great, infinitely too great: his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits often oppress me; but
there is something in him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) which I object to still more. I must say,
cousin, that I cannot approve his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) character. I have not thought well of
him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) from the time of the play. I then saw him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) behaving, as it appeared
to me, so very improperly and unfeelingly—I may speak of it now because
it is all over—so improperly by poor Mr. Rushworth, not seeming to care
how he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) exposed or hurt him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>), and paying attentions to my cousin Maria,
which—in short, at the time of the play, I received an impression which
will never be got over."

<p/>"My dear Fanny," replied Edmund, scarcely hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to the end, "let
us not, any of us, be judged by what we appeared at that period of
general folly. The time of the play is a time which I hate to
recollect. Maria was wrong, Crawford was wrong, we were all wrong
together; but none so wrong as myself. Compared with me, all the rest
were blameless. I was playing the fool with my eyes open."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As a bystander,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, "perhaps I saw more than you did; and I
do think that Mr. Rushworth was sometimes very jealous."

<p/>"Very possibly. No wonder. Nothing could be more improper than the
whole business. I am shocked whenever I think that Maria could be
capable of it; but, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could undertake the part, we must not be
surprised at the rest."

<p/>"Before the play, I am much mistaken if _Julia_ did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was
paying her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) attentions."

<p/>"Julia! I have heard before from some one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) being in love with
Julia; but I could never see anything of it. And, Fanny, though I hope
I do justice to my sisters’ good qualities, I think it very possible
that they might, one or both, be more desirous of being admired by
Crawford, and might shew that desire rather more unguardedly than was
perfectly prudent. I can remember that they were evidently fond of his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
society; and with such encouragement, a man like Crawford, lively, and
it may be, a little unthinking, might be led on to—there could be
nothing very striking, because it is clear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had no pretensions:
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart was reserved for you. And I must say, that its being for you
has raised him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) inconceivably in my opinion. It does him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the highest
honour; it shews his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) proper estimation of the blessing of domestic
happiness and pure attachment. It proves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unspoilt by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) uncle. It
proves him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in short, everything that I had been used to wish to
believe him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and feared he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not."

<p/>"I am persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not think, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought, on serious
subjects."

<p/>"Say, rather, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has not thought at all upon serious subjects,
which I believe to be a good deal the case. How could it be otherwise,
with such an education and adviser? Under the disadvantages, indeed,
which both have had, is it not wonderful that they should be what they
are? Crawford’s _feelings_, I am ready to acknowledge, have hitherto
been too much his (<font color='blue'><b>adviser</b></font>) guides. Happily, those feelings have generally been
good. You will supply the rest; and a most fortunate man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is to
attach himself to such a creature—to a woman who, firm as a rock in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
own principles, has a gentleness of character so well adapted to
recommend them. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has chosen his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) partner, indeed, with rare felicity.
He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will make you happy, Fanny; I know he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) will make you happy; but you
will make him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) everything."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would not engage in such a charge,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, in a shrinking
accent; "in such an office of high responsibility!"

<p/>"As usual, believing yourself unequal to anything! fancying everything
too much for you! Well, though I may not be able to persuade you into
different feelings, you will be persuaded into them, I trust. I confess
myself sincerely anxious that you may. I have no common interest in
Crawford’s well-doing. Next to your happiness, Fanny, his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has the first
claim on me. You are aware of my having no common interest in
Crawford."

<p/>Fanny was too well aware of it to have anything to say; and they walked
on together some fifty yards in mutual silence and abstraction. Edmund
first began again—

<p/>"I was very much pleased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner of speaking of it yesterday,
particularly pleased, because I had not depended upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seeing
everything in so just a light. I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was very fond of you; but yet
I was afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not estimating your worth to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother quite as
it deserved, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not rather fixed on some
woman of distinction or fortune. I was afraid of the bias of those
worldly maxims, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has been too much used to hear. But it was
very different. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spoke of you, Fanny, just as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desires
the connexion as warmly as your uncle or myself. We had a long talk
about it. I should not have mentioned the subject, though very anxious
to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sentiments; but I had not been in the room five minutes
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began introducing it with all that openness of heart, and
sweet peculiarity of manner, that spirit and ingenuousness which are so
much a part of herself. Mrs. Grant laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) rapidity."

<p/>"Was Mrs. Grant in the room, then?"

<p/>"Yes, when I reached the house I found the two sisters together by
themselves; and when once we had begun, we had not done with you,
Fanny, till Crawford and Dr. Grant came in."

<p/>"It is above a week since I saw Miss Crawford."

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) laments it; yet owns it may have been best. You will see her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
however, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) goes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is very angry with you, Fanny; you must
be prepared for that. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) calls herself very angry, but you can imagine
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anger. It is the regret and disappointment of a sister, who thinks
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother has a right to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may wish for, at the first
moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is hurt, as you would be for William; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loves and
esteems you with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart."

<p/>"I knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would be very angry with me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dearest Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>cried Edmund, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) arm closer to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), "do
not let the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anger distress you. It is anger to be talked of
rather than felt. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart is made for love and kindness, not for
resentment. I wish you could have overheard her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tribute of praise; I
wish you could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said that you
_should_ be Henry’s wife. And I observed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) always spoke of you
as <div class="bookquote">‘Fanny,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was never used to do; and it had a sound of most
sisterly cordiality."

<p/>"And Mrs. Grant, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) say—did she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) speak; was she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) there all the
time?"

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was agreeing exactly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister. The surprise of your
refusal, Fanny, seems to have been unbounded. That you could refuse
such a man as Henry Crawford seems more than they can understand. I
said what I could for you; but in good truth, as they stated the
case—you must prove yourself to be in your senses as soon as you can by
a different conduct; nothing else will satisfy them. But this is
teasing you. I have done. Do not turn away from me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I _should_ have thought,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, after a pause of recollection
and exertion, "that every woman must have felt the possibility of a
man’s not being approved, not being loved by some one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sex at
least, let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) be ever so generally agreeable. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) have all the
perfections in the world, I think it ought not to be set down as
certain that a man must be acceptable to every woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may happen to
like himself. But, even supposing it is so, allowing Mr. Crawford to
have all the claims which his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters think he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has, how was I to be
prepared to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with any feeling answerable to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own? He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) took me
wholly by surprise. I had not an idea that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) behaviour to me before
had any meaning; and surely I was not to be teaching myself to like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was taking what seemed very idle notice of me. In my
situation, it would have been the extreme of vanity to be forming
expectations on Mr. Crawford. I am sure his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters, rating him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) as they
do, must have thought it so, supposing he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had meant nothing. How, then,
was I to be—to be in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was with me?
How was I to have an attachment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) service, as soon as it was asked
for? His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters should consider me as well as him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). The higher his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
deserts, the more improper for me ever to have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). And,
and—we think very differently of the nature of women, if they can
imagine a woman so very soon capable of returning an affection as this
seems to imply."

<p/>"My dear, dear Fanny, now I have the truth. I know this to be the
truth; and most worthy of you are such feelings. I had attributed them
to you before. I thought I could understand you. You have now given
exactly the explanation which I ventured to make for you to your friend
and Mrs. Grant, and they were both better satisfied, though your
warm-hearted friend was still run away with a little by the enthusiasm
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) fondness for Henry. I told them that you were of all human
creatures the one over whom habit had most power and novelty least; and
that the very circumstance of the novelty of Crawford’s addresses was
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>). Their being so new and so recent was all in their
disfavour; that you could tolerate nothing that you were not used to;
and a great deal more to the same purpose, to give them a knowledge of
your character. Miss Crawford made us laugh by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) plans of
encouragement for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to urge him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to persevere in
the hope of being loved in time, and of having his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) addresses most
kindly received at the end of about ten years’ happy marriage."

<p/>Fanny could with difficulty give the smile that was here asked for. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
feelings were all in revolt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been doing wrong:
saying too much, overacting the caution which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been fancying
necessary; in guarding against one evil, laying herself open to
another; and to have Miss Crawford’s liveliness repeated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at such
a moment, and on such a subject, was a bitter aggravation.

<p/>Edmund saw weariness and distress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) face, and immediately resolved
to forbear all farther discussion; and not even to mention the name of
Crawford again, except as it might be connected with what _must_ be
agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). On this principle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) soon afterwards observed—"They
go on Monday. You are sure, therefore, of seeing your friend either
to-morrow or Sunday. They really go on Monday; and I was within a
trifle of being persuaded to stay at Lessingby till that very day! I
had almost promised it. What a difference it might have made! Those
five or six days more at Lessingby might have been felt all my life."

<p/>"You were near staying there?"

<p/>"Very. I was most kindly pressed, and had nearly consented. Had I
received any letter from Mansfield, to tell me how you were all going
on, I believe I should certainly have staid; but I knew nothing that
had happened here for a fortnight, and felt that I had been away long
enough."

<p/>"You spent your time pleasantly there?"

<p/>"Yes; that is, it was the fault of my own mind if I did not. They were
all very pleasant. I doubt their finding me so. I took uneasiness with
me, and there was no getting rid of it till I was in Mansfield again."

<p/>"The Miss Owens—you liked them, did not you?"

<p/>"Yes, very well. Pleasant, good-humoured, unaffected girls. But I am
spoilt, Fanny, for common female society. Good-humoured, unaffected
girls will not do for a man who has been used to sensible women. They
are two distinct orders of being. You and Miss Crawford have made me
too nice."
