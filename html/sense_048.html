<p/>Elinor now found the difference between the expectation of an
unpleasant event, however certain the mind may be told to consider it,
and certainty itself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now found, that in spite of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
always admitted a hope, while Edward remained single, that something
would occur to prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marrying Lucy; that some resolution of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
own, some mediation of friends, or some more eligible opportunity of
establishment for the lady, would arise to assist the happiness of all.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was now married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) condemned her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) heart for the lurking
flattery, which so much heightened the pain of the intelligence.

<p/>That he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should be married soon, before (as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) imagined) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be in
orders, and consequently before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) could be in possession of the
living, surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a little at first. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) soon saw how likely it
was that Lucy, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) self-provident care, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) haste to secure him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),
should overlook every thing but the risk of delay. They were married,
married in town, and now hastening down to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) uncle’s. What had Edward
felt on being within four miles from Barton, on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother’s
servant, on hearing Lucy’s message!

<p/>They would soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) supposed, be settled at Delaford.—Delaford,—that
place in which so much conspired to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) an interest; which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
wished to be acquainted with, and yet desired to avoid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) saw them in
an instant in their parsonage-house; saw in Lucy, the active,
contriving manager, uniting at once a desire of smart appearance with
the utmost frugality, and ashamed to be suspected of half her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
economical practices;—pursuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own interest in every thought,
courting the favour of Colonel Brandon, of Mrs. Jennings, and of every
wealthy friend. In Edward—she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) knew not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) saw, nor what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
wished to see;—happy or unhappy,—nothing pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) turned away
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) head from every sketch of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor flattered herself that some one of their connections in London
would write to them to announce the event, and give farther
particulars,—but day after day passed off, and brought no letter, no
tidings. Though uncertain that any one were to blame, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found fault
with every absent friend. They were all thoughtless or indolent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When do you write to Colonel Brandon, ma’am?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was an inquiry which
sprung from the impatience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind to have something going on.

<p/>"I wrote to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), my love, last week, and rather expect to see, than to
hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) again. I earnestly pressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) coming to us, and should
not be surprised to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) walk in today or tomorrow, or any day."

<p/>This was gaining something, something to look forward to. Colonel
Brandon _must_ have some information to give.

<p/>Scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) so determined it, when the figure of a man on
horseback drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eyes to the window. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stopt at their gate. It was a
gentleman, it was Colonel Brandon himself. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could hear more; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) trembled in expectation of it. But it was _not_ Colonel Brandon;
neither his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) air, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) height. Were it possible, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must say it must
be Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) looked again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had just dismounted: she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not be
mistaken,—it _was_ Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved away and sat down. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) comes from
Mr. Pratt’s purposely to see us. I _will_ be calm; I _will_ be mistress
of myself."

<p/>In a moment she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) perceived that the others were likewise aware of the
mistake. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) mother and Marianne change colour; saw them look
at herself, and whisper a few sentences to each other. She (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) would have
given the world to be able to speak—and to make them understand that
she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) hoped no coolness, no slight, would appear in their behaviour to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>);—but she (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) had no utterance, and was obliged to leave all to their
own discretion.

<p/>Not a syllable passed aloud. They all waited in silence for the
appearance of their visitor. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) footsteps were heard along the gravel
path; in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was in the passage, and in another he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was before
them.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) countenance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) entered the room, was not too happy, even for
Elinor. His (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) complexion was white with agitation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) looked as if
fearful of his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) reception, and conscious that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) merited no kind one.
Mrs. Dashwood, however, conforming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) trusted, to the wishes of
that daughter, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) then meant in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) heart to be
guided in every thing, met him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) with a look of forced complacency, gave
him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hand, and wished him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) joy.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) coloured, and stammered out an unintelligible reply. Elinor’s lips
had moved with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s, and, when the moment of action was over,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) too. But it was then too
late, and with a countenance meaning to be open, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sat down again and
talked of the weather.

<p/>Marianne had retreated as much as possible out of sight, to conceal her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
distress; and Margaret, understanding some part, but not the whole of
the case, thought it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to be dignified, and therefore
took a seat as far from him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could, and maintained a strict
silence.

<p/>When Elinor had ceased to rejoice in the dryness of the season, a very
awful pause took place. It was put an end to by Mrs. Dashwood, who felt
obliged to hope that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had left Mrs. Ferrars very well. In a hurried
manner, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied in the affirmative.

<p/>Another pause.

<p/>Elinor resolving to exert herself, though fearing the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own
voice, now said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is Mrs. Ferrars at Longstaple?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"At Longstaple!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) replied, with an air of surprise. <div class="bookquote">"No, my mother is
in town."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I meant,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, taking up some work from the table, "to enquire
for Mrs. _Edward_ Ferrars."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dared not look up;—but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and Marianne both turned their
eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coloured, seemed perplexed, looked doubtingly, and,
after some hesitation, said,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps you mean—my brother—you mean Mrs.—Mrs. _Robert_ Ferrars."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Mrs. Robert Ferrars!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>was repeated by Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother in an
accent of the utmost amazement; and though Elinor could not speak, even
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ eyes were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) with the same impatient wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) rose
from his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) seat, and walked to the window, apparently from not knowing
what to do; took up a pair of scissors that lay there, and while
spoiling both them and their sheath by cutting the latter to pieces as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) spoke, said, in a hurried voice,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps you do not know: you may not have heard that my brother is
lately married to—to the youngest—to Miss Lucy Steele."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) words were echoed with unspeakable astonishment by all but Elinor,
who sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) head leaning over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) work, in a state of such
agitation as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"they were married last week, and are now at Dawlish."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Elinor could sit it no longer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) almost ran out of the room, and as
soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought would never cease. Edward, who had till then looked any
where, rather than at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hurry away, and perhaps saw—or even
heard, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) emotion; for immediately afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fell into a reverie,
which no remarks, no inquiries, no affectionate address of Mrs.
Dashwood could penetrate, and at last, without saying a word, quitted
the room, and walked out towards the village—leaving the others in the
greatest astonishment and perplexity on a change in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) situation, so
wonderful and so sudden;—a perplexity which they had no means of
lessening but by their own conjectures.
