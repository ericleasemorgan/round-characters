<p/>This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was obliged, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at that moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never stopt till she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been wrong, yet he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had been less wrong than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed—and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) had suffered, and was very sorry—and he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) have entered the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must have shaken hands with him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) as heartily as ever.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought so well of the letter, that when Mr. Knightley came again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) desired him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to read it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was sure of Mrs. Weston's wishing it to be communicated; especially to one, who, like Mr. Knightley, had seen so much to blame in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) conduct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall be very glad to look it over,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); "but it seems long. I will take it home with me at night."

<p/>But that would not do. Mr. Weston was to call in the evening, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must return it by him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would rather be talking to you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) replied; <div class="bookquote">"but as it seems a matter of justice, it shall be done."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began—stopping, however, almost directly to say, <div class="bookquote">"Had I been offered the sight of one of this gentleman's letters to his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) mother-in-law a few months ago, Emma, it would not have been taken with such indifference."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) proceeded a little farther, reading to himself; and then, with a smile, observed, "Humph! a fine complimentary opening: But it is his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) way. One man's style must not be the rule of another's. We will not be severe."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It will be natural for me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) added shortly afterwards, "to speak my opinion aloud as I read. By doing it, I shall feel that I am near you. It will not be so great a loss of time: but if you dislike it—"

<p/>"Not at all. I should wish it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Knightley returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reading with greater alacrity.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) trifles here," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), "as to the temptation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knows he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is wrong, and has nothing rational to urge.—Bad.—He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ought not to have formed the engagement.—<div class="bookquote">'His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father's disposition:' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>—he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is unjust, however, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father. Mr. Weston's sanguine temper was a blessing on all his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) upright and honourable exertions; but Mr. Weston earned every present comfort before he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) endeavoured to gain it.—Very true; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not come till Miss Fairfax was here."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I have not forgotten,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "how sure you were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might have come sooner if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would. You pass it over very handsomely—but you were perfectly right."

<p/>"I was not quite impartial in my judgment, Emma:—but yet, I think—had you not been in the case—I should still have distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)."

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) came to Miss Woodhouse, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to read the whole of it aloud—all that related to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), with a smile; a look; a shake of the head; a word or two of assent, or disapprobation; or merely of love, as the subject required; concluding, however, seriously, and, after steady reflection, thus—

<p/>"Very bad—though it might have been worse.—Playing a most dangerous game. Too much indebted to the event for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) acquittal.—No judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own manners by you.—Always deceived in fact by his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own wishes, and regardless of little besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own convenience.—Fancying you to have fathomed his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret. Natural enough!—his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind full of intrigue, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should suspect it in others.—Mystery; Finesse—how they pervert the understanding! My Emma, does not every thing serve to prove more and more the beauty of truth and sincerity in all our dealings with each other?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma agreed to it, and with a blush of sensibility on Harriet's account, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not give any sincere explanation of.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>You had better go on," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>pervert</b></font>) did so, but very soon stopt again to say, "the pianoforte! Ah! That was the act of a very, very young man, one too young to consider whether the inconvenience of it might not very much exceed the pleasure. A boyish scheme, indeed!—I cannot comprehend a man's wishing to give a woman any proof of affection which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would rather dispense with; and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) would have prevented the instrument's coming if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could."

<p/>After this, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) made some progress without any pause. Frank Churchill's confession of having behaved shamefully was the first thing to call for more than a word in passing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I perfectly agree with you, sir," (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>—was then his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) remark. "You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) made a fuller pause to say, "This is very bad.—He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had induced her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to place herself, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first object to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) from suffering unnecessarily.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) one fault, and remember that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) should have been in such a state of punishment."

<p/>Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was now getting to the Box Hill party, and grew uncomfortable. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour had been so very improper! She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was deeply ashamed, and a little afraid of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) next look. It was all read, however, steadily, attentively, and without the smallest remark; and, excepting one momentary glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), instantly withdrawn, in the fear of giving pain—no remembrance of Box Hill seemed to exist.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no saying much for the delicacy of our good friends, the Eltons,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) next observation.—<div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) feelings are natural.—What! actually resolve to break with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) entirely!—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt the engagement to be a source of repentance and misery to each—she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dissolved it.—What a view this gives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) behaviour!—Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must be a most extraordinary—"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Nay, nay, read on.—You will find how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) suffers."

<p/>"I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) does,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mr. Knightley coolly, and resuming the letter. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">'Smallridge!' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>—What does this mean? What is all this?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had engaged to go as governess to Mrs. Smallridge's children—a dear friend of Mrs. Elton's—a neighbour of Maple Grove; and, by the bye, I wonder how Mrs. Elton bears the disappointment?"

<p/>"Say nothing, my dear Emma, while you oblige me to read—not even of Mrs. Elton. Only one page more. I shall soon have done. What a letter the man writes!"

<p/>"I wish you would read it with a kinder spirit towards him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/>"Well, there is feeling here.—He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does seem to have suffered in finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ill.—Certainly, I can have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">'Dearer, much dearer than ever.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may long continue to feel all the value of such a reconciliation.—He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a very liberal thanker, with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thousands and tens of thousands.—<div class="bookquote">'Happier than I deserve.'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Come, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows himself there. <div class="bookquote">'Miss Woodhouse calls me the child of good fortune.' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>—Those were Miss Woodhouse's words, were they?— And a fine ending—and there is the letter. The child of good fortune! That was your name for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), was it?"

<p/>"You do not appear so well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letter as I am; but still you must, at least I hope you must, think the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for it. I hope it does him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) some service with you."

<p/>"Yes, certainly it does. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has had great faults, faults of inconsideration and thoughtlessness; and I am very much of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion in thinking him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likely to be happier than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) deserves: but still as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is, beyond a doubt, really attached to Miss Fairfax, and will soon, it may be hoped, have the advantage of being constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), I am very ready to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character will improve, and acquire from hers the steadiness and delicacy of principle that it wants. And now, let me talk to you of something else. I have another person's interest at present so much at heart, that I cannot think any longer about Frank Churchill. Ever since I left you this morning, Emma, my mind has been hard at work on one subject."

<p/>The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was in love with, how to be able to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), without attacking the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word. "While her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could never quit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)." Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not agree to. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Donwell; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had wanted to believe it feasible, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to deceive himself long; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, perhaps even of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life, which must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!—No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) felt that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) trusted his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's happiness—in other words, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life—required Hartfield to continue her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) home, it should be his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) likewise.

<p/>Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own passing thoughts. Like him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sensible of all the affection it evinced. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt that, in quitting Donwell, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, and in no house of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised to think of it, and advised him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to think of it more; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wishes or his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opinion on the subject. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had given it, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), very long and calm consideration; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) thoughts to himself.

<p/>"Ah! there is one difficulty unprovided for,<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure William Larkins will not like it. You must get his (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) consent before you ask mine."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) promised, however, to think of it; and pretty nearly promised, moreover, to think of it, with the intention of finding it a very good scheme.

<p/>It is remarkable, that Emma, in the many, very many, points of view in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was now beginning to consider Donwell Abbey, was never struck with any sense of injury to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nephew Henry, whose rights as heir-expectant had formerly been so tenaciously regarded. Think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.

<p/>This proposal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), this plan of marrying and continuing at Hartfield—the more she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) contemplated it, the more pleasing it became. His (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) evils seemed to lessen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own advantages to increase, their mutual good to outweigh every drawback. Such a companion for herself in the periods of anxiety and cheerlessness before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>)!—Such a partner in all those duties and cares to which time must be giving increase of melancholy!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) future absence as any deduction from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in such a state of unmerited punishment.

<p/>In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;—not like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be in love with more than three men in one year.
