<p/>Marianne got up the next morning at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual time; to every inquiry
replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was better, and tried to prove herself so, by engaging
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) accustomary employments. But a day spent in sitting shivering
over the fire with a book in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was unable to read, or
in lying, weary and languid, on a sofa, did not speak much in favour of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) amendment; and when, at last, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went early to bed, more and more
indisposed, Colonel Brandon was only astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s
composure, who, though attending and nursing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the whole day, against
Marianne’s inclination, and forcing proper medicines on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at night,
trusted, like Marianne, to the certainty and efficacy of sleep, and
felt no real alarm.

<p/>A very restless and feverish night, however, disappointed the
expectation of both; and when Marianne, after persisting in rising,
confessed herself unable to sit up, and returned voluntarily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
bed, Elinor was very ready to adopt Mrs. Jennings’s advice, of sending
for the Palmers’ apothecary.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came, examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) patient, and though encouraging Miss Dashwood to
expect that a very few days would restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sister to health, yet, by
pronouncing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) disorder to have a putrid tendency, and allowing the
word <div class="bookquote">"infection"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to pass his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips, gave instant alarm to Mrs. Palmer,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) baby’s account. Mrs. Jennings, who had been inclined from the
first to think Marianne’s complaint more serious than Elinor, now
looked very grave on Mr. Harris’s report, and confirming Charlotte’s
fears and caution, urged the necessity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) immediate removal with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) infant; and Mr. Palmer, though treating their apprehensions as
idle, found the anxiety and importunity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife too great to be
withstood. Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) departure, therefore, was fixed on; and within an hour
after Mr. Harris’s arrival, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) set off, with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) little boy and his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>)
nurse, for the house of a near relation of Mr. Palmer’s, who lived a
few miles on the other side of Bath; whither her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) husband promised, at
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) earnest entreaty, to join her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) in a day or two; and whither she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was
almost equally urgent with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) mother to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). Mrs. Jennings,
however, with a kindness of heart which made Elinor really love her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) resolution of not stirring from Cleveland as long as
Marianne remained ill, and of endeavouring, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own attentive care,
to supply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the place of the mother she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from; and
Elinor found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) on every occasion a most willing and active helpmate,
desirous to share in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fatigues, and often by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) better
experience in nursing, of material use.

<p/>Poor Marianne, languid and low from the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) malady, and
feeling herself universally ill, could no longer hope that tomorrow
would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovered; and the idea of what tomorrow would have
produced, but for this unlucky illness, made every ailment severe; for
on that day they were to have begun their journey home; and, attended
the whole way by a servant of Mrs. Jennings, were to have taken their
mother by surprise on the following forenoon. The little she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) said was
all in lamentation of this inevitable delay; though Elinor tried to
raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believe, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) _then_ really believed
herself, that it would be a very short one.

<p/>The next day produced little or no alteration in the state of the
patient; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) certainly was not better, and, except that there was no
amendment, did not appear worse. Their party was now farther reduced;
for Mr. Palmer, though very unwilling to go as well from real humanity
and good-nature, as from a dislike of appearing to be frightened away
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) wife, was persuaded at last by Colonel Brandon to perform his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
promise of following her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>); and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was preparing to go, Colonel
Brandon himself, with a much greater exertion, began to talk of going
likewise.—Here, however, the kindness of Mrs. Jennings interposed most
acceptably; for to send the Colonel away while his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) love was in so much
uneasiness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister’s account, would be to deprive them both, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
thought, of every comfort; and therefore telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) at once that his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
stay at Cleveland was necessary to herself, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) should want him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) to
play at piquet of an evening, while Miss Dashwood was above with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sister, &c. she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) urged him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) so strongly to remain, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), who was
gratifying the first wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) own heart by a compliance, could not
long even affect to demur; especially as Mrs. Jennings’s entreaty was
warmly seconded by Mr. Palmer, who seemed to feel a relief to himself,
in leaving behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) a person so well able to assist or advise Miss
Dashwood in any emergence.

<p/>Marianne was, of course, kept in ignorance of all these arrangements.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew not that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been the means of sending the owners of
Cleveland away, in about seven days from the time of their arrival. It
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no surprise that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw nothing of Mrs. Palmer; and as it
gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) likewise no concern, she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) never mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) name.

<p/>Two days passed away from the time of Mr. Palmer’s departure, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
situation continued, with little variation, the same. Mr. Harris, who
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) every day, still talked boldly of a speedy recovery, and
Miss Dashwood was equally sanguine; but the expectation of the others
was by no means so cheerful. Mrs. Jennings had determined very early in
the seizure that Marianne would never get over it, and Colonel Brandon,
who was chiefly of use in listening to Mrs. Jennings’s forebodings, was
not in a state of mind to resist their influence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) tried to reason
himself out of fears, which the different judgment of the apothecary
seemed to render absurd; but the many hours of each day in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was
left entirely alone, were but too favourable for the admission of every
melancholy idea, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could not expel from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind the persuasion
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) should see Marianne no more.

<p/>On the morning of the third day however, the gloomy anticipations of
both were almost done away; for when Mr. Harris arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) declared
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient materially better. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) pulse was much stronger, and every
symptom more favourable than on the preceding visit. Elinor, confirmed
in every pleasant hope, was all cheerfulness; rejoicing that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own judgment rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend’s, in making very light of the indisposition which delayed them
at Cleveland; and almost fixing on the time when Marianne would be able
to travel.

<p/>But the day did not close so auspiciously as it began. Towards the
evening Marianne became ill again, growing more heavy, restless, and
uncomfortable than before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, however, still sanguine, was
willing to attribute the change to nothing more than the fatigue of
having sat up to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bed made; and carefully administering the
cordials prescribed, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with satisfaction, sink at last into a
slumber, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected the most beneficial effects. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sleep, though not so quiet as Elinor wished to see it, lasted a
considerable time; and anxious to observe the result of it herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
resolved to sit with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) during the whole of it. Mrs. Jennings, knowing
nothing of any change in the patient, went unusually early to bed; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
maid, who was one of the principal nurses, was recreating herself in
the housekeeper’s room, and Elinor remained alone with Marianne.

<p/>The repose of the latter became more and more disturbed; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister, who watched, with unremitting attention her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) continual change of
posture, and heard the frequent but inarticulate sounds of complaint
which passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips, was almost wishing to rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from so painful
a slumber, when Marianne, suddenly awakened by some accidental noise in
the house, started hastily up, and, with feverish wildness, cried out,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is mama coming?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Not yet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried the other, concealing her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) terror, and assisting
Marianne to lie down again, "but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be here, I hope, before it is
long. It is a great way, you know, from hence to Barton."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) must not go round by London,<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, in the same
hurried manner. " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>I shall never see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) goes by London."

<p/>Elinor perceived with alarm that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not quite herself, and, while
attempting to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), eagerly felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pulse. It was lower and
quicker than ever! and Marianne, still talking wildly of mama, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
alarm increased so rapidly, as to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) on sending instantly
for Mr. Harris, and despatching a messenger to Barton for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother.
To consult with Colonel Brandon on the best means of effecting the
latter, was a thought which immediately followed the resolution of its
performance; and as soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had rung up the maid to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) place by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hastened down to the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was generally to be found at a much later hour than the present.

<p/>It was no time for hesitation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) difficulties were
immediately before him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had no courage, no confidence to
attempt the removal of:—he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) listened to them in silent despondence;—but
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) difficulties were instantly obviated, for with a readiness that
seemed to speak the occasion, and the service pre-arranged in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) offered himself as the messenger who should fetch Mrs. Dashwood.
Elinor made no resistance that was not easily overcome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
with brief, though fervent gratitude, and while he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) went to hurry off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) servant with a message to Mr. Harris, and an order for post-horses
directly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wrote a few lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>The comfort of such a friend at that moment as Colonel Brandon—or such
a companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother,—how gratefully was it felt!—a companion
whose judgment would guide, whose attendance must relieve, and whose
friendship might soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)!—as far as the shock of such a summons
_could_ be lessened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) presence, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manners, his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) assistance,
would lessen it.

<p/>_He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>)_, meanwhile, whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) might feel, acted with all the firmness of
a collected mind, made every necessary arrangement with the utmost
despatch, and calculated with exactness the time in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might
look for his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) return. Not a moment was lost in delay of any kind. The
horses arrived, even before they were expected, and Colonel Brandon
only pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand with a look of solemnity, and a few words spoken
too low to reach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ear, hurried into the carriage. It was then about
twelve o’clock, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s apartment to wait for
the arrival of the apothecary, and to watch by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) the rest of the
night. It was a night of almost equal suffering to both. Hour after
hour passed away in sleepless pain and delirium on Marianne’s side, and
in the most cruel anxiety on Elinor’s, before Mr. Harris appeared. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
apprehensions once raised, paid by their excess for all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) former
security; and the servant who sat up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not allow
Mrs. Jennings to be called, only tortured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) more, by hints of what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mistress had always thought.

<p/>Marianne’s ideas were still, at intervals, fixed incoherently on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
mother, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) name, it gave a pang to the
heart of poor Elinor, who, reproaching herself for having trifled with
so many days of illness, and wretched for some immediate relief,
fancied that all relief might soon be in vain, that every thing had
been delayed too long, and pictured to herself her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suffering mother
arriving too late to see this darling child, or to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) rational.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was on the point of sending again for Mr. Harris, or if _he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)_ could
not come, for some other advice, when the former—but not till after
five o’clock—arrived. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) opinion, however, made some little amends for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) delay, for though acknowledging a very unexpected and unpleasant
alteration in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) patient, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) would not allow the danger to be
material, and talked of the relief which a fresh mode of treatment must
procure, with a confidence which, in a lesser degree, was communicated
to Elinor. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) promised to call again in the course of three or four
hours, and left both the patient and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) anxious attendant more
composed than he (<font color='blue'><b>attendant</b></font>) had found them.

<p/>With strong concern, and with many reproaches for not being called to
their aid, did Mrs. Jennings hear in the morning of what had passed.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) former apprehensions, now with greater reason restored, left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) no
doubt of the event; and though trying to speak comfort to Elinor, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s danger would not allow her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to offer the
comfort of hope. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart was really grieved. The rapid decay, the
early death of a girl so young, so lovely as Marianne, must have struck
a less interested person with concern. On Mrs. Jennings’s compassion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had other claims. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had been for three months her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) companion, was
still under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) care, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was known to have been greatly injured,
and long unhappy. The distress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister too, particularly a
favourite, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>);—and as for their mother, when Mrs. Jennings
considered that Marianne might probably be to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ what Charlotte was
to herself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sympathy in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)_ sufferings was very sincere.

<p/>Mr. Harris was punctual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) second visit;—but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) came to be
disappointed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) hopes of what the last would produce. His (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) medicines
had failed;—the fever was unabated; and Marianne only more quiet—not
more herself—remained in a heavy stupor. Elinor, catching all, and more
than all, his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) fears in a moment, proposed to call in further advice.
But he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) judged it unnecessary: he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) had still something more to try, some
more fresh application, of whose success he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) was as confident as the
last, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) visit concluded with encouraging assurances which reached
the ear, but could not enter the heart of Miss Dashwood. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was calm,
except when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was almost hopeless; and
in this state she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) continued till noon, scarcely stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sister’s bed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thoughts wandering from one image of grief, one
suffering friend to another, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits oppressed to the utmost by
the conversation of Mrs. Jennings, who scrupled not to attribute the
severity and danger of this attack to the many weeks of previous
indisposition which Marianne’s disappointment had brought on. Elinor
felt all the reasonableness of the idea, and it gave fresh misery to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reflections.

<p/>About noon, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began—but with a caution—a dread of
disappointment which for some time kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silent, even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend—to fancy, to hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could perceive a slight amendment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister’s pulse;—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) waited, watched, and examined it again and
again;—and at last, with an agitation more difficult to bury under
exterior calmness, than all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) foregoing distress, ventured to
communicate her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hopes. Mrs. Jennings, though forced, on examination, to
acknowledge a temporary revival, tried to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) young friend from
indulging a thought of its continuance;—and Elinor, conning over every
injunction of distrust, told herself likewise not to hope. But it was
too late. Hope had already entered; and feeling all its anxious
flutter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) bent over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to watch—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hardly knew for what.
Half an hour passed away, and the favourable symptom yet blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).
Others even arose to confirm it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) breath, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) skin, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lips, all
flattered Elinor with signs of amendment; and Marianne fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) with a rational, though languid, gaze. Anxiety and hope now
oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in equal degrees, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) no moment of tranquillity
till the arrival of Mr. Harris at four o’clock;—when his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) assurances,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) felicitations on a recovery in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister even surpassing his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>)
expectation, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) confidence, comfort, and tears of joy.

<p/>Marianne was in every respect materially better, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
entirely out of danger. Mrs. Jennings, perhaps satisfied with the
partial justification of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) forebodings which had been found in their
late alarm, allowed herself to trust in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harris</b></font>) judgment, and admitted,
with unfeigned joy, and soon with unequivocal cheerfulness, the
probability of an entire recovery.

<p/>Elinor could not be cheerful. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy was of a different kind, and led
to any thing rather than to gaiety. Marianne restored to life, health,
friends, and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) doting mother, was an idea to fill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart with
sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent
gratitude;—but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no
smiles. All within Elinor’s breast was satisfaction, silent and strong.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued by the side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, with little intermission the
whole afternoon, calming every fear, satisfying every inquiry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
enfeebled spirits, supplying every succour, and watching almost every
look and every breath. The possibility of a relapse would of course, in
some moments, occur to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) of what anxiety was—but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw,
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frequent and minute examination, that every symptom of recovery
continued, and saw Marianne at six o’clock sink into a quiet, steady,
and to all appearance comfortable, sleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) silenced every doubt.

<p/>The time was now drawing on, when Colonel Brandon might be expected
back. At ten o’clock, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) trusted, or at least not much later her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
mother would be relieved from the dreadful suspense in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) must
now be travelling towards them. The Colonel, too!—perhaps scarcely less
an object of pity!—Oh!—how slow was the progress of time which yet kept
them in ignorance!

<p/>At seven o’clock, leaving Marianne still sweetly asleep, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joined
Mrs. Jennings in the drawing-room to tea. Of breakfast she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been
kept by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fears, and of dinner by their sudden reverse, from eating
much;—and the present refreshment, therefore, with such feelings of
content as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brought to it, was particularly welcome. Mrs. Jennings
would have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), at its conclusion, to take some rest before
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother’s arrival, and allow _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)_ to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) place by Marianne;
but Elinor had no sense of fatigue, no capability of sleep at that
moment about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not to be kept away from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister an
unnecessary instant. Mrs. Jennings therefore attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) up stairs
into the sick chamber, to satisfy herself that all continued right,
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) there again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) charge and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts, and retired to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
own room to write letters and sleep.

<p/>The night was cold and stormy. The wind roared round the house, and the
rain beat against the windows; but Elinor, all happiness within,
regarded it not. Marianne slept through every blast; and the
travellers—they had a rich reward in store, for every present
inconvenience.

<p/>The clock struck eight. Had it been ten, Elinor would have been
convinced that at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heard a carriage driving up to the
house; and so strong was the persuasion that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) _did_, in spite of the
_almost_ impossibility of their being already come, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) moved into
the adjoining dressing-closet and opened a window shutter, to be
satisfied of the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ears had not
deceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). The flaring lamps of a carriage were immediately in view.
By their uncertain light she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could discern it to be drawn
by four horses; and this, while it told the excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) poor mother’s
alarm, gave some explanation to such unexpected rapidity.

<p/>Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) life had Elinor found it so difficult to be calm, as at
that moment. The knowledge of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must be feeling as the
carriage stopt at the door—of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) doubt—her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dread—perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
despair!—and of what _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ had to tell!—with such knowledge it was
impossible to be calm. All that remained to be done was to be speedy;
and, therefore staying only till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could leave Mrs. Jennings’s maid
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) hurried down stairs.

<p/>The bustle in the vestibule, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) passed along an inner lobby,
assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) that they were already in the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) rushed to the
drawing-room,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) entered it,—and saw only Willoughby.
