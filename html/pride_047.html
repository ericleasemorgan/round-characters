<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have been thinking it over again, Elizabeth,"  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle,
as they drove from the town; "and really, upon serious
consideration, I am much more inclined than I was to judge as
your eldest sister does on the matter. It appears to me so very
unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a
girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless, and who was
actually staying in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) colonel’s family, that I am strongly
inclined to hope the best. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expect that her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) friends would
not step forward? Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expect to be noticed again by the
regiment, after such an affront to Colonel Forster? His (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
temptation is not adequate to the risk!"

<p/>"Do you really think so?<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth, brightening up for a
moment.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>Upon my word," said Mrs. Gardiner, "I begin to be of your
uncle’s opinion. It is really too great a violation of decency,
honour, and interest, for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be guilty of. I cannot think so
very ill of Wickham. Can you yourself, Lizzy, so wholly give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
up, as to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of it?"

<p/>"Not, perhaps, of neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) own interest; but of every other
neglect I can believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable. If, indeed, it should be so!
But I dare not hope it. Why should they not go on to Scotland if
that had been the case?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"In the first place,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Gardiner, "there is no absolute
proof that they are not gone to Scotland."

<p/>"Oh! but their removing from the chaise into a hackney coach is
such a presumption! And, besides, no traces of them were to be
found on the Barnet road."

<p/>"Well, then—supposing them to be in London. They may be there,
though for the purpose of concealment, for no more exceptional
purpose. It is not likely that money should be very abundant on
either side; and it might strike them that they could be more
economically, though less expeditiously, married in London than
in Scotland."

<p/>"But why all this secrecy? Why any fear of detection? Why must
their marriage be private? Oh, no, no—this is not likely. His (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
most particular friend, you see by Jane’s account, was persuaded
of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never intending to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Wickham will never marry a
woman without some money. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) cannot afford it. And what claims
has Lydia—what attraction has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) beyond youth, health, and good
humour that could make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sake, forego every chance of
benefiting himself by marrying well? As to what restraint the
apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a
dishonourable elopement with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), I am not able to judge; for I
know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce. But
as to your other objection, I am afraid it will hardly hold good.
Lydia has no brothers to step forward; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) might imagine, from
my father’s behaviour, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) indolence and the little
attention he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) family, that _he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)_ would do as little, and think as little
about it, as any father could do, in such a matter."

<p/>"But can you think that Lydia is so lost to everything but love
of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as to consent to live with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on any terms other than
marriage?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It does seem, and it is most shocking indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied
Elizabeth, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, "that a sister’s sense of
decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt. But,
really, I know not what to say. Perhaps I am not doing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
justice. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is very young; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has never been taught to
think on serious subjects; and for the last half-year, nay, for a
twelvemonth—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has been given up to nothing but amusement and
vanity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has been allowed to dispose of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) time in the most
idle and frivolous manner, and to adopt any opinions that came in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way. Since the ——shire were first quartered in Meryton,
nothing but love, flirtation, and officers have been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) has been doing everything in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power by thinking and
talking on the subject, to give greater—what shall I call it?
susceptibility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings; which are naturally lively
enough. And we all know that Wickham has every charm of person
and address that can captivate a woman."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But you see that Jane,"  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt, "does not think so very
ill of Wickham as to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of the attempt."

<p/>"Of whom does Jane ever think ill? And who is there, whatever
might be their former conduct, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would think capable of
such an attempt, till it were proved against them? But Jane
knows, as well as I do, what Wickham really is. We both know that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has been profligate in every sense of the word; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has
neither integrity nor honour; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is as false and deceitful
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is insinuating."

<p/>"And do you really know all this?<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Gardiner, whose
curiosity as to the mode of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) intelligence was all alive.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do indeed," replied Elizabeth, colouring. "I told you, the
other day, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) infamous behaviour to Mr. Darcy; and you
yourself, when last at Longbourn, heard in what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) spoke
of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). And there are other circumstances which I am not at
liberty—which it is not worth while to relate; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) lies about
the whole Pemberley family are endless. From what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) said of Miss
Darcy I was thoroughly prepared to see a proud, reserved,
disagreeable girl. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) knew to the contrary himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must
know that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was as amiable and unpretending as we have found
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)."

<p/>"But does Lydia know nothing of this? can she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) be ignorant of what
you and Jane seem so well to understand?"

<p/>"Oh, yes!—that, that is the worst of all. Till I was in Kent, and
saw so much both of Mr. Darcy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) relation Colonel
Fitzwilliam, I was ignorant of the truth myself. And when I
returned home, the ——shire was to leave Meryton in a week or
fortnight’s time. As that was the case, neither Jane, to whom I
related the whole, nor I, thought it necessary to make our
knowledge public; for of what use could it apparently be to any
one, that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
should then be overthrown? And even when it was settled that
Lydia should go with Mrs. Forster, the necessity of opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) character never occurred to me. That _she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)_ could be
in any danger from the deception never entered my head. That such
a consequence as _this_ could ensue, you may easily believe, was
far enough from my thoughts."

<p/>"When they all removed to Brighton, therefore, you had no reason,
I suppose, to believe them fond of each other?"

<p/>"Not the slightest. I can remember no symptom of affection on
either side; and had anything of the kind been perceptible, you
must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be
thrown away. When first he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) entered the corps, she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was ready
enough to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>); but so we all were. Every girl in or near
Meryton was out of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) senses about him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) for the first two months;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) never distinguished _her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ by any particular attention;
and, consequently, after a moderate period of extravagant and
wild admiration, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) fancy for him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) gave way, and others of the
regiment, who treated her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with more distinction, again became her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
favourites."

<p/>It may be easily believed, that however little of novelty could
be added to their fears, hopes, and conjectures, on this
interesting subject, by its repeated discussion, no other could
detain them from it long, during the whole of the journey. From
Elizabeth’s thoughts it was never absent. Fixed there by the
keenest of all anguish, self-reproach, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could find no interval
of ease or forgetfulness.

<p/>They travelled as expeditiously as possible, and, sleeping one
night on the road, reached Longbourn by dinner time the next day.
It was a comfort to Elizabeth to consider that Jane could not
have been wearied by long expectations.

<p/>The little Gardiners, attracted by the sight of a chaise, were
standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock;
and, when the carriage drove up to the door, the joyful surprise
that lighted up their faces, and displayed itself over their
whole bodies, in a variety of capers and frisks, was the first
pleasing earnest of their welcome.

<p/>Elizabeth jumped out; and, after giving each of them a hasty
kiss, hurried into the vestibule, where Jane, who came running
down from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother’s apartment, immediately met her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affectionately embraced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), whilst tears
filled the eyes of both, lost not a moment in asking whether
anything had been heard of the fugitives.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not yet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>replied Jane. <div class="bookquote">"But now that my dear uncle is come, I
hope everything will be well."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Is my father in town?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) went on Tuesday, as I wrote you word."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And have you heard from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) often?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"We have heard only twice. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote me a few lines on Wednesday
to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had arrived in safety, and to give me his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
directions, which I particularly begged him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) merely
added that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) should not write again till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had something of
importance to mention."

<p/>"And my mother—how is she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)? How are you all?"

<p/>"My mother is tolerably well, I trust; though her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spirits are
greatly shaken. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) is up stairs and will have great satisfaction
in seeing you all. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not yet leave her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) dressing-room. Mary
and Kitty, thank Heaven, are quite well."

<p/>"But you—how are you?<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You look pale. How much
you must have gone through!"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, however, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being perfectly well; and
their conversation, which had been passing while Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner were engaged with their children, was now put an end to
by the approach of the whole party. Jane ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) uncle and
aunt, and welcomed and thanked them both, with alternate smiles
and tears.

<p/>When they were all in the drawing-room, the questions which
Elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the
others, and they soon found that Jane had no intelligence to
give. The sanguine hope of good, however, which the benevolence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart suggested had not yet deserted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) still
expected that it would all end well, and that every morning would
bring some letter, either from Lydia or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father, to explain
their proceedings, and, perhaps, announce their marriage.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, to whose apartment they all repaired, after a few
minutes’ conversation together, received them exactly as might be
expected; with tears and lamentations of regret, invectives
against the villainous conduct of Wickham, and complaints of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
own sufferings and ill-usage; blaming everybody but the person to
whose ill-judging indulgence the errors of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter must
principally be owing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I had been able,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), "to carry my point in going to
Brighton, with all my family, _this_ would not have happened; but
poor dear Lydia had nobody to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). Why did the
Forsters ever let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) go out of their sight? I am sure there was
some great neglect or other on their side, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is not the
kind of girl to do such a thing if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had been well looked
after. I always thought they were very unfit to have the charge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>); but I was overruled, as I always am. Poor dear child! And
now here’s Mr. Bennet gone away, and I know he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will fight
Wickham, wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) meets him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be killed, and
what is to become of us all? The Collinses will turn us out
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is cold in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) grave, and if you are not kind to us,
brother, I do not know what we shall do.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They all exclaimed against such terrific ideas; and Mr. Gardiner,
after general assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
family, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meant to be in London the very next day,
and would assist Mr. Bennet in every endeavour for recovering
Lydia.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Do not give way to useless alarm," added he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>); "though it is right
to be prepared for the worst, there is no occasion to look on it
as certain. It is not quite a week since they left Brighton. In a
few days more we may gain some news of them; and till we know
that they are not married, and have no design of marrying, do not
let us give the matter over as lost. As soon as I get to town I
shall go to my brother, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) come home with me to
Gracechurch Street; and then we may consult together as to what
is to be done."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! my dear brother,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Bennet, "that is exactly what
I could most wish for. And now do, when you get to town, find
them out, wherever they may be; and if they are not married
already, _make_ them marry. And as for wedding clothes, do not
let them wait for that, but tell Lydia she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) shall have as much
money as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) chooses to buy them, after they are married. And,
above all, keep Mr. Bennet from fighting. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) what a
dreadful state I am in, that I am frighted out of my wits—and
have such tremblings, such flutterings, all over me—such spasms
in my side and pains in my head, and such beatings at heart, that
I can get no rest by night nor by day. And tell my dear Lydia not
to give any directions about her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) clothes till she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has seen me,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) does not know which are the best warehouses. Oh, brother,
how kind you are! I know you will contrive it all."

<p/>But Mr. Gardiner, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) again of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) earnest
endeavours in the cause, could not avoid recommending moderation
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), as well in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hopes as her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) fear; and after talking with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) in this manner till dinner was on the table, they all left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to vent all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) feelings on the housekeeper, who attended in
the absence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) brother and sister were persuaded that there was no
real occasion for such a seclusion from the family, they did not
attempt to oppose it, for they knew that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had not prudence
enough to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) tongue before the servants, while they waited
at table, and judged it better that _one_ only of the household,
and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
fears and solicitude on the subject.

<p/>In the dining-room they were soon joined by Mary and Kitty, who
had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make
their appearance before. One came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) books, and the other
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) toilette. The faces of both, however, were tolerably
calm; and no change was visible in either, except that the loss
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) favourite sister, or the anger which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had herself
incurred in this business, had given more of fretfulness than
usual to the accents of Kitty. As for Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was mistress
enough of herself to whisper to Elizabeth, with a countenance of
grave reflection, soon after they were seated at table:

<p/>"This is a most unfortunate affair, and will probably be much
talked of. But we must stem the tide of malice, and pour into the
wounded bosoms of each other the balm of sisterly consolation."

<p/>Then, perceiving in Elizabeth no inclination of replying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
added, "Unhappy as the event must be for Lydia, we may draw from
it this useful lesson: that loss of virtue in a female is
irretrievable; that one false step involves her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) in endless ruin;
that her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful; and
that she (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) cannot be too much guarded in her (<font color='blue'><b>female</b></font>) behaviour towards the
undeserving of the other sex."

<p/>Elizabeth lifted up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes in amazement, but was too much
oppressed to make any reply. Mary, however, continued to console
herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before
them.

<p/>In the afternoon, the two elder Miss Bennets were able to be for
half-an-hour by themselves; and Elizabeth instantly availed
herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries, which Jane
was equally eager to satisfy. After joining in general
lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event, which
Elizabeth considered as all but certain, and Miss Bennet could
not assert to be wholly impossible, the former continued the
subject, by saying, "But tell me all and everything about it
which I have not already heard. Give me further particulars. What
did Colonel Forster say? Had they no apprehension of anything
before the elopement took place? They must have seen them
together for ever."

<p/>"Colonel Forster did own that he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) had often suspected some
partiality, especially on Lydia’s side, but nothing to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
any alarm. I am so grieved for him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)! His (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) behaviour was attentive
and kind to the utmost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) _was_ coming to us, in order to assure
us of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) concern, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) had any idea of their not being gone
to Scotland: when that apprehension first got abroad, it hastened
his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) journey."

<p/>"And was Denny convinced that Wickham would not marry? Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
know of their intending to go off? Had Colonel Forster seen Denny
himself?"

<p/>"Yes; but, when questioned by _him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)_, Denny denied knowing
anything of their plans, and would not give his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) real opinion
about it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) did not repeat his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) persuasion of their not
marrying—and from _that_, I am inclined to hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) might have
been misunderstood before."

<p/>"And till Colonel Forster came himself, not one of you
entertained a doubt, I suppose, of their being really married?"

<p/>"How was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains? I
felt a little uneasy—a little fearful of my sister’s happiness
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) in marriage, because I knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) conduct had not
been always quite right. My father and mother knew nothing of
that; they only felt how imprudent a match it must be. Kitty then
owned, with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest
of us, that in Lydia’s last letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) for such
a step. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had known, it seems, of their being in love with each
other, many weeks."

<p/>"But not before they went to Brighton?"

<p/>"No, I believe not."

<p/>"And did Colonel Forster appear to think well of Wickham himself?
Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) know his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) real character?"

<p/>"I must confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) did not speak so well of Wickham as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
formerly did. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to be imprudent and extravagant.
And since this sad affair has taken place, it is said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
left Meryton greatly in debt; but I hope this may be false."

<p/>"Oh, Jane, had we been less secret, had we told what we knew of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), this could not have happened!"

<p/>"Perhaps it would have been better,<div class="bookquote">" replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister. " (<font color='red'><b>any person</b></font>)</div>But to
expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their
present feelings were, seemed unjustifiable. We acted with the
best intentions."

<p/>"Could Colonel Forster repeat the particulars of Lydia’s note to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) wife?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) brought it with him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) for us to see."

<p/>Jane then took it from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pocket-book, and gave it to Elizabeth.
These were the contents:

<p/>"My dear Harriet,
"You will laugh when you know where I am gone, and I cannot help
laughing myself at your surprise to-morrow morning, as soon as I
am missed. I am going to Gretna Green, and if you cannot guess
with who, I shall think you a simpleton, for there is but one man
in the world I love, and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is an angel. I should never be happy
without him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), so think it no harm to be off. You need not send
them word at Longbourn of my going, if you do not like it, for it
will make the surprise the greater, when I write to them and sign
my name <div class="bookquote">‘Lydia Wickham.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>What a good joke it will be! I can
hardly write for laughing. Pray make my excuses to Pratt for not
keeping my engagement, and dancing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) to-night. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) I
hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) will excuse me when he (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) knows all; and tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) I will
dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>Pratt</b></font>) at the next ball we meet, with great pleasure. I
shall send for my clothes when I get to Longbourn; but I wish you
would tell Sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown
before they are packed up. Good-bye. Give my love to Colonel
Forster. I hope you will drink to our good journey.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your affectionate friend,
" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>LYDIA BENNET."

<p/>"Oh! thoughtless, thoughtless Lydia!<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
had finished it. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What a letter is this, to be written at such a
moment! But at least it shows that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)_ was serious on the
subject of their journey. Whatever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might afterwards persuade
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to, it was not on her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) side a _scheme_ of infamy. My poor
father! how he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) must have felt it!"

<p/>"I never saw anyone so shocked. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not speak a word for
full ten minutes. My mother was taken ill immediately, and the
whole house in such confusion!"

<p/>"Oh! Jane,<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth, " (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>was there a servant belonging to it
who did not know the whole story before the end of the day?"

<p/>"I do not know. I hope there was. But to be guarded at such a
time is very difficult. My mother was in hysterics, and though I
endeavoured to give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) every assistance in my power, I am afraid
I did not do so much as I might have done! But the horror of what
might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties."

<p/>"Your attendance upon her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) has been too much for you. You do not
look well. Oh that I had been with you! you have had every care
and anxiety upon yourself alone."

<p/>"Mary and Kitty have been very kind, and would have shared in
every fatigue, I am sure; but I did not think it right for either
of them. Kitty is slight and delicate; and Mary studies so much,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hours of repose should not be broken in on. My aunt
Phillips came to Longbourn on Tuesday, after my father went away;
and was so good as to stay till Thursday with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was of
great use and comfort to us all. And Lady Lucas has been very
kind; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) walked here on Wednesday morning to condole with us,
and offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) services, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) daughters’, if they
should be of use to us."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) had better have stayed at home,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth; "perhaps
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) _meant_ well, but, under such a misfortune as this, one
cannot see too little of one’s neighbours. Assistance is
impossible; condolence insufferable. Let them triumph over us at
a distance, and be satisfied.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then proceeded to enquire into the measures which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father
had intended to pursue, while in town, for the recovery of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
daughter.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant I believe," replied Jane, "to go to Epsom, the place
where they last changed horses, see the postilions and try if
anything could be made out from them. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) principal object must
be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them
from Clapham. It had come with a fare from London; and as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and lady’s removing
from one carriage into another might be remarked he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) meant to make
enquiries at Clapham. If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could anyhow discover at what house
the coachman had before set down his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fare, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) determined to make
enquiries there, and hoped it might not be impossible to find out
the stand and number of the coach. I do not know of any other
designs that he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) had formed; but he (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) was in such a hurry to be
gone, and his (<font color='blue'><b>coach</b></font>) spirits so greatly discomposed, that I had
difficulty in finding out even so much as this."
