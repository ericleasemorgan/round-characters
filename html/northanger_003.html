<p/>Every morning now brought its regular duties—shops were to be visited;
some new part of the town to be looked at; and the pump-room to be
attended, where they paraded up and down for an hour, looking at
everybody and speaking to no one. The wish of a numerous acquaintance
in Bath was still uppermost with Mrs. Allen, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) repeated it after
every fresh proof, which every morning brought, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) knowing nobody
at all.

<p/>They made their appearance in the Lower Rooms; and here fortune was
more favourable to our heroine. The master of the ceremonies introduced
to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) a very gentlemanlike young man as a partner; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was
Tilney. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be about four or five and twenty, was rather tall,
had a pleasing countenance, a very intelligent and lively eye, and, if
not quite handsome, was very near it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address was good, and
Catherine felt herself in high luck. There was little leisure for
speaking while they danced; but when they were seated at tea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had already given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) credit for being. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
talked with fluency and spirit—and there was an archness and pleasantry
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manner which interested, though it was hardly understood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).
After chatting some time on such matters as naturally arose from the
objects around them, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) suddenly addressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) with—"I have hitherto
been very remiss, madam, in the proper attentions of a partner here; I
have not yet asked you how long you have been in Bath; whether you were
ever here before; whether you have been at the Upper Rooms, the
theatre, and the concert; and how you like the place altogether. I have
been very negligent—but are you now at leisure to satisfy me in these
particulars? If you are I will begin directly."

<p/>"You need not give yourself that trouble, sir."

<p/>"No trouble, I assure you, madam." Then forming his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) features into a set
smile, and affectedly softening his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) voice, he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) added, with a simpering
air, "Have you been long in Bath, madam?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"About a week, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>replied Catherine, trying not to laugh.

<p/>"Really!<div class="bookquote">" with affected astonishment.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Why should you be surprised, sir?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), in his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) natural tone. "But some emotion must
appear to be raised by your reply, and surprise is more easily assumed,
and not less reasonable than any other. Now let us go on. Were you
never here before, madam?"

<p/>"Never, sir."

<p/>"Indeed! Have you yet honoured the Upper Rooms?"

<p/>"Yes, sir, I was there last Monday."

<p/>"Have you been to the theatre?"

<p/>"Yes, sir, I was at the play on Tuesday."

<p/>"To the concert?"

<p/>"Yes, sir, on Wednesday."

<p/>"And are you altogether pleased with Bath?"

<p/>"Yes—I like it very well."

<p/>"Now I must give one smirk, and then we may be rational again.<div class="bookquote">"
Catherine turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head, not knowing whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might venture
to laugh. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I see what you think of me," said he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) gravely—"I shall make
but a poor figure in your journal tomorrow."

<p/>"My journal!"

<p/>"Yes, I know exactly what you will say: Friday, went to the Lower
Rooms; wore my sprigged muslin robe with blue trimmings—plain black
shoes—appeared to much advantage; but was strangely harassed by a
queer, half-witted man, who would make me dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and
distressed me by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) nonsense."

<p/>"Indeed I shall say no such thing."

<p/>"Shall I tell you what you ought to say?"

<p/>"If you please."

<p/>"I danced with a very agreeable young man, introduced by Mr. King; had
a great deal of conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)—seems a most extraordinary
genius—hope I may know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>). _That_, madam, is what I _wish_ you
to say."

<p/>"But, perhaps, I keep no journal."

<p/>"Perhaps you are not sitting in this room, and I am not sitting by you.
These are points in which a doubt is equally possible. Not keep a
journal! How are your absent cousins to understand the tenour of your
life in Bath without one? How are the civilities and compliments of
every day to be related as they ought to be, unless noted down every
evening in a journal? How are your various dresses to be remembered,
and the particular state of your complexion, and curl of your hair to
be described in all their diversities, without having constant recourse
to a journal? My dear madam, I am not so ignorant of young ladies’ ways
as you wish to believe me; it is this delightful habit of journaling
which largely contributes to form the easy style of writing for which
ladies are so generally celebrated. Everybody allows that the talent of
writing agreeable letters is peculiarly female. Nature may have done
something, but I am sure it must be essentially assisted by the
practice of keeping a journal."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have sometimes thought,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, doubtingly, "whether ladies
do write so much better letters than gentlemen! That is—I should not
think the superiority was always on our side."

<p/>"As far as I have had opportunity of judging, it appears to me that the
usual style of letter-writing among women is faultless, except in three
particulars."

<p/>"And what are they?"

<p/>"A general deficiency of subject, a total inattention to stops, and a
very frequent ignorance of grammar."

<p/>"Upon my word! I need not have been afraid of disclaiming the
compliment. You do not think too highly of us in that way."

<p/>"I should no more lay it down as a general rule that women write better
letters than men, than that they sing better duets, or draw better
landscapes. In every power, of which taste is the foundation,
excellence is pretty fairly divided between the sexes."

<p/>They were interrupted by Mrs. Allen: <div class="bookquote">"My dear Catherine,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), "do
take this pin out of my sleeve; I am afraid it has torn a hole already;
I shall be quite sorry if it has, for this is a favourite gown, though
it cost but nine shillings a yard."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is exactly what I should have guessed it, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Tilney/Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Mr.
Tilney, looking at the muslin.

<p/>"Do you understand muslins, sir?"

<p/>"Particularly well; I always buy my own cravats, and am allowed to be
an excellent judge; and my sister has often trusted me in the choice of
a gown. I bought one for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) the other day, and it was pronounced to be
a prodigious bargain by every lady who saw it. I gave but five
shillings a yard for it, and a true Indian muslin.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Allen was quite struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) genius. " (<font color='red'><b>Men</b></font>)</div>Men commonly take so little
notice of those things," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>); "I can never get Mr. Allen to know
one of my gowns from another. You must be a great comfort to your
sister, sir."

<p/>"I hope I am, madam."

<p/>"And pray, sir, what do you think of Miss Morland’s gown?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is very pretty, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), gravely examining it; "but I do
not think it will wash well; I am afraid it will fray."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How can you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, laughing, "be so—" She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had almost said
"strange."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am quite of your opinion, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Allen; "and so I told
Miss Morland when she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) bought it."

<p/>"But then you know, madam, muslin always turns to some account or
other; Miss Morland will get enough out of it for a handkerchief, or a
cap, or a cloak. Muslin can never be said to be wasted. I have heard my
sister say so forty times, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has been extravagant in buying more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted, or careless in cutting it to pieces."

<p/>"Bath is a charming place, sir; there are so many good shops here. We
are sadly off in the country; not but what we have very good shops in
Salisbury, but it is so far to go—eight miles is a long way; Mr. Allen
says it is nine, measured nine; but I am sure it cannot be more than
eight; and it is such a fag—I come back tired to death. Now, here one
can step out of doors and get a thing in five minutes."

<p/>Mr. Tilney was polite enough to seem interested in what she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) said; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) on the subject of muslins till the dancing recommenced.
Catherine feared, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) listened to their discourse, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) indulged
himself a little too much with the foibles of others. <div class="bookquote">"What are you
thinking of so earnestly?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), as they walked back to the
ballroom; <div class="bookquote">"not of your partner, I hope, for, by that shake of the head,
your meditations are not satisfactory."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Catherine coloured, and said, <div class="bookquote">"I was not thinking of anything."

 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"That is artful and deep, to be sure; but I had rather be told at once
that you will not tell me."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Well then, I will not."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Thank you; for now we shall soon be acquainted, as I am authorized to
tease you on this subject whenever we meet, and nothing in the world
advances intimacy so much."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>They danced again; and, when the assembly closed, parted, on the lady’s
side at least, with a strong inclination for continuing the
acquaintance. Whether she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) so much, while she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) drank her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
warm wine and water, and prepared herself for bed, as to dream of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
when there, cannot be ascertained; but I hope it was no more than in a
slight slumber, or a morning doze at most; for if it be true, as a
celebrated writer has maintained, that no young lady can be justified
in falling in love before the gentleman’s love is declared,[1] it must
be very improper that a young lady should dream of a gentleman before
the gentleman is first known to have dreamt of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). How proper Mr.
Tilney might be as a dreamer or a lover had not yet perhaps entered Mr.
Allen’s head, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was not objectionable as a common
acquaintance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) young charge he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) was on inquiry satisfied; for he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
had early in the evening taken pains to know who her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) partner was, and
had been assured of Mr. Tilney’s being a clergyman, and of a very
respectable family in Gloucestershire.
