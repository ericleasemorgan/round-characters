<p/><div class="bookquote">"Harriet, poor Harriet!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself very ill in many ways, but it was not so much his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) behaviour as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own, which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so angry with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). It was the scrape which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had drawn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) offence. Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) once said, <div class="bookquote">"Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) nothing but disservice. It was true that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had ever given her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a hint on the subject; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have repressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) influence would have been enough. And now she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very conscious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to have prevented them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been risking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to tell Harriet, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must not allow herself to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and that there were five hundred chances to one against his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) ever caring for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"But, with common sense,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">"I am afraid I have had little to do."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was extremely angry with herself. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful. As for Jane Fairfax, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) might at least relieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) feelings from any present solicitude on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) days of insignificance and evil were over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous. Emma could now imagine why her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own attentions had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No doubt it had been from jealousy. In Jane's eyes she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been a rival; and well might any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) understood it all; and as far as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first. Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words. "For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum." Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) superior duty.

<p/>In spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) vexation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not help feeling it almost ridiculous, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should have the very same distressing and delicate office to perform by Harriet, which Mrs. Weston had just gone through by herself. The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was approaching Randalls. Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance! But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Miss Woodhouse!"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, coming eagerly into the room <div class="bookquote">"is not this the oddest news that ever was?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"What news do you mean?"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, unable to guess, by look or voice, whether Harriet could indeed have received any hint.

<p/>"About Jane Fairfax. Did you ever hear any thing so strange? Oh! you need not be afraid of owning it to me, for Mr. Weston has told me himself. I met him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) just now. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me it was to be a great secret; and, therefore, I should not think of mentioning it to any body but you, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said you knew it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What did Mr. Weston tell you?"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, still perplexed.

<p/>"Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) told me all about it; that Jane Fairfax and Mr. Frank Churchill are to be married, and that they have been privately engaged to one another this long while. How very odd!"

<p/>It was, indeed, so odd; Harriet's behaviour was so extremely odd, that Emma did not know how to understand it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) character appeared absolutely changed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed to propose shewing no agitation, or disappointment, or peculiar concern in the discovery. Emma looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quite unable to speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Had you any idea,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, "of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)? You, perhaps, might. You (blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spoke) who can see into every body's heart; but nobody else "

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "I begin to doubt my having any such talent. Can you seriously ask me, Harriet, whether I imagined him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) attached to another woman at the very time that I was tacitly, if not openly encouraging you to give way to your own feelings? I never had the slightest suspicion, till within the last hour, of Mr. Frank Churchill's having the least regard for Jane Fairfax. You may be very sure that if I had, I should have cautioned you accordingly."

<p/>"Me!<div class="bookquote">" cried Harriet, colouring, and astonished. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Why should you caution me? You do not think I care about Mr. Frank Churchill."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am delighted to hear you speak so stoutly on the subject,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, smiling; "but you do not mean to deny that there was a time and not very distant either when you gave me reason to understand that you did care about him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)! never, never. Dear Miss Woodhouse, how could you so mistake me?<div class="bookquote">" turning away distressed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>Harriet!" cried Emma, after a moment's pause "What do you mean? Good Heaven! what do you mean? Mistake you! Am I to suppose then? "

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not speak another word. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) voice was lost; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat down, waiting in great terror till Harriet should answer.

<p/>Harriet, who was standing at some distance, and with face turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), did not immediately say any thing; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak, it was in a voice nearly as agitated as Emma's.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should not have thought it possible,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began, <div class="bookquote">"that you could have misunderstood me! I know we agreed never to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) but considering how infinitely superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is to every body else, I should not have thought it possible that I could be supposed to mean any other person. Mr. Frank Churchill, indeed! I do not know who would ever look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) in the company of the other. I hope I have a better taste than to think of Mr. Frank Churchill, who is like nobody by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) side. And that you should have been so mistaken, is amazing! I am sure, but for believing that you entirely approved and meant to encourage me in my attachment, I should have considered it at first too great a presumption almost, to dare to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). At first, if you had not told me that more wonderful things had happened; that there had been matches of greater disparity (those were your very words); I should not have dared to give way to I should not have thought it possible But if you, who had been always acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) "

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"Harriet!" cried Emma, collecting herself resolutely "Let us understand each other now, without the possibility of farther mistake. Are you speaking of Mr. Knightley?"

<p/>"To be sure I am. I never could have an idea of any body else and so I thought you knew. When we talked about him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), it was as clear as possible."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not quite,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, with forced calmness, "for all that you then said, appeared to me to relate to a different person. I could almost assert that you had named Mr. Frank Churchill. I am sure the service Mr. Frank Churchill had rendered you, in protecting you from the gipsies, was spoken of."

<p/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, how you do forget!"

<p/>"My dear Harriet, I perfectly remember the substance of what I said on the occasion. I told you that I did not wonder at your attachment; that considering the service he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had rendered you, it was extremely natural: and you agreed to it, expressing yourself very warmly as to your sense of that service, and mentioning even what your sensations had been in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) come forward to your rescue. The impression of it is strong on my memory."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>cried Harriet, "now I recollect what you mean; but I was thinking of something very different at the time. It was not the gipsies it was not Mr. Frank Churchill that I meant. No! (with some elevation) I was thinking of a much more precious circumstance of Mr. Knightley's coming and asking me to dance, when Mr. Elton would not stand up with me; and when there was no other partner in the room. That was the kind action; that was the noble benevolence and generosity; that was the service which made me begin to feel how superior he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was to every other being upon earth."

<p/>"Good God!" cried Emma, "this has been a most unfortunate most deplorable mistake! What is to be done?"

<p/>"You would not have encouraged me, then, if you had understood me? At least, however, I cannot be worse off than I should have been, if the other had been the person; and now it is possible "

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paused a few moments. Emma could not speak.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not wonder, Miss Woodhouse,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) resumed, "that you should feel a great difference between the two, as to me or as to any body. You must think one five hundred million times more above me than the other. But I hope, Miss Woodhouse, that supposing that if strange as it may appear . But you know they were your own words, that more wonderful things had happened, matches of greater disparity had taken place than between Mr. Frank Churchill and me; and, therefore, it seems as if such a thing even as this, may have occurred before and if I should be so fortunate, beyond expression, as to if Mr. Knightley should really if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) does not mind the disparity, I hope, dear Miss Woodhouse, you will not set yourself against it, and try to put difficulties in the way. But you are too good for that, I am sure."

<p/>Harriet was standing at one of the windows. Emma turned round to look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in consternation, and hastily said,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Have you any idea of Mr. Knightley's returning your affection?"

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>"Yes," replied Harriet modestly, but not fearfully <div class="bookquote">"I must say that I have."

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma's eyes were instantly withdrawn; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat silently meditating, in a fixed attitude, for a few minutes. A few minutes were sufficient for making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart. A mind like hers, once opening to suspicion, made rapid progress. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) touched she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admitted she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acknowledged the whole truth. Why was it so much worse that Harriet should be in love with Mr. Knightley, than with Frank Churchill? Why was the evil so dreadfully increased by Harriet's having some hope of a return? It darted through her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), with the speed of an arrow, that Mr. Knightley must marry no one but herself!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own conduct, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the same few minutes. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) saw it all with a clearness which had never blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) before. How improperly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) been acting by Harriet! How inconsiderate, how indelicate, how irrational, how unfeeling had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conduct! What blindness, what madness, had led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on! It struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with dreadful force, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was ready to give it every bad name in the world. Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits some concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet (there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley but justice required that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) right. Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) emotion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost. Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.

<p/>Harriet, who had been standing in no unhappy reverie, was yet very glad to be called from it, by the now encouraging manner of such a judge, and such a friend as Miss Woodhouse, and only wanted invitation, to give the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hopes with great, though trembling delight. Emma's tremblings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened, were better concealed than Harriet's, but they were not less. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) voice was not unsteady; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was in all the perturbation that such a development of self, such a burst of threatening evil, such a confusion of sudden and perplexing emotions, must create. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) listened with much inward suffering, but with great outward patience, to Harriet's detail. Methodical, or well arranged, or very well delivered, it could not be expected to be; but it contained, when separated from all the feebleness and tautology of the narration, a substance to sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirit especially with the corroborating circumstances, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own memory brought in favour of Mr. Knightley's most improved opinion of Harriet.

<p/>Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) behaviour ever since those two decisive dances. Emma knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had, on that occasion, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) much superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expectation. From that evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), Harriet had begun to be sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been used to do, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) having indeed quite a different manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); a manner of kindness and sweetness! Latterly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had so often come and walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and talked so very delightfully! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed to want to be acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Emma knew it to have been very much the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had often observed the change, to almost the same extent. Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had known of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) opinion of Harriet. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) praised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw such recommendations in Harriet; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had dwelt on them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) more than once. Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself. The first, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) walking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had taken pains (as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was convinced) to draw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the rest to himself and at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a more particular way than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed! (Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) seemed to be almost asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) affections were engaged. But as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) changed the subject, and began talking about farming: The second, was his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having sat talking with her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) visit, the very last morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) being at Hartfield though, when he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) first came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had said that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could not stay five minutes and his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) having told her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>), during their conversation, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) must go to London, it was very much against his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) inclination that he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had acknowledged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) severe pain.

<p/>On the subject of the first of the two circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did, after a little reflection, venture the following question. "Might he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) not? Is not it possible, that when enquiring, as you thought, into the state of your affections, he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) might be alluding to Mr. Martin he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) might have Mr. Martin's interest in view? But Harriet rejected the suspicion with spirit.

<p/>"Mr. Martin! No indeed! There was not a hint of Mr. Martin. I hope I know better now, than to care for Mr. Martin, or to be suspected of it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>When Harriet had closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) evidence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) appealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dear Miss Woodhouse, to say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had not good ground for hope.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I never should have presumed to think of it at first," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), "but for you. You told me to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) carefully, and let his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) behaviour be the rule of mine and so I have. But now I seem to feel that I may deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) does chuse me, it will not be any thing so very wonderful.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The bitter feelings occasioned by this speech, the many bitter feelings, made the utmost exertion necessary on Emma's side, to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to say on reply,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Harriet/Harriet Smith</b></font>)</div>Harriet, I will only venture to declare, that Mr. Knightley is the last man in the world, who would intentionally give any woman the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feeling for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) really does."

<p/>Harriet seemed ready to worship her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend for a sentence so satisfactory; and Emma was only saved from raptures and fondness, which at that moment would have been dreadful penance, by the sound of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's footsteps. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was coming through the hall. Harriet was too much agitated to encounter him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not compose herself  Mr. Woodhouse would be alarmed she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had better go;"  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>with most ready encouragement from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) passed off through another door and the moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was gone, this was the spontaneous burst of Emma's feelings: "Oh God! that I had never seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)!"

<p/>The rest of the day, the following night, were hardly enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was bewildered amidst the confusion of all that had rushed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) within the last few hours. Every moment had brought a fresh surprize; and every surprize must be matter of humiliation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). How to understand it all! How to understand the deceptions she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been thus practising on herself, and living under! The blunders, the blindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own head and heart! she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat still, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried the shrubbery in every place, every posture, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had acted most weakly; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been imposed on by others in a most mortifying degree; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been imposing on herself in a degree yet more mortifying; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wretched, and should probably find this day but the beginning of wretchedness.

<p/>To understand, thoroughly understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart, was the first endeavour. To that point went every leisure moment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's claims on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed, and every moment of involuntary absence of mind.

<p/>How long had Mr. Knightley been so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as every feeling declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) now to be? When had his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) influence, such influence begun?  When had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) succeeded to that place in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection, which Frank Churchill had once, for a short period, occupied? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked back; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) compared the two compared them, as they had always stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) estimation, from the time of the latter's becoming known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and as they must at any time have been compared by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), had it oh! had it, by any blessed felicity, occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to institute the comparison. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw that there never had been a time when she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not consider Mr. Knightley as infinitely the superior, or when his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not been infinitely the most dear. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw, that in persuading herself, in fancying, in acting to the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been entirely under a delusion, totally ignorant of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own heart and, in short, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never really cared for Frank Churchill at all!

<p/>This was the conclusion of the first series of reflection. This was the knowledge of herself, on the first question of inquiry, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) reached; and without being long in reaching it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was most sorrowfully indignant; ashamed of every sensation but the one revealed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection for Mr. Knightley. Every other part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind was disgusting.

<p/>With insufferable vanity had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed herself in the secret of every body's feelings; with unpardonable arrogance proposed to arrange every body's destiny. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was proved to have been universally mistaken; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not quite done nothing for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had done mischief. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had brought evil on Harriet, on herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) too much feared, on Mr. Knightley. Were this most unequal of all connexions to take place, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must rest all the reproach of having given it a beginning; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must believe to be produced only by a consciousness of Harriet's; and even were this not the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would never have known Harriet at all but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) folly.

<p/>Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith! It was a union to distance every wonder of the kind. The attachment of Frank Churchill and Jane Fairfax became commonplace, threadbare, stale in the comparison, exciting no surprize, presenting no disparity, affording nothing to be said or thought. Mr. Knightley and Harriet Smith! Such an elevation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) side! Such a debasement on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)! It was horrible to Emma to think how it must sink him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in the general opinion, to foresee the smiles, the sneers, the merriment it would prompt at his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expense; the mortification and disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother, the thousand inconveniences to himself. Could it be? No; it was impossible. And yet it was far, very far, from impossible. Was it a new circumstance for a man of first-rate abilities to be captivated by very inferior powers? Was it new for one, perhaps too busy to seek, to be the prize of a girl who would seek him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)? Was it new for any thing in this world to be unequal, inconsistent, incongruous or for chance and circumstance (as second causes) to direct the human fate?

<p/>Oh! had she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) never brought Harriet forward! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) where she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought, and where he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought! Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) not, with a folly which no tongue could express, prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) marrying the unexceptionable young man who would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happy and respectable in the line of life to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to belong all would have been safe; none of this dreadful sequel would have been.

<p/>How Harriet could ever have had the presumption to raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts to Mr. Knightley! How she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could dare to fancy herself the chosen of such a man till actually assured of it! But Harriet was less humble, had fewer scruples than formerly. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) inferiority, whether of mind or situation, seemed little felt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had seemed more sensible of Mr. Elton's being to stoop in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) now seemed of Mr. Knightley's. Alas! was not that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own doing too? Who had been at pains to give Harriet notions of self-consequence but herself? Who but herself had taught her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was to elevate herself if possible, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) claims were great to a high worldly establishment? If Harriet, from being humble, were grown vain, it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) doing too.
