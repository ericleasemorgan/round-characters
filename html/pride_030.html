<p/>Sir William stayed only a week at Hunsford, but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) visit was
long enough to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) daughter’s being most
comfortably settled, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) possessing such a husband and
such a neighbour as were not often met with. While Sir William
was with them, Mr. Collins devoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) morning to driving him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) out
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) gig, and showing him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the country; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) went away,
the whole family returned to their usual employments, and
Elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cousin by the alteration, for the chief of the time between
breakfast and dinner was now passed by him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) either at work in the
garden or in reading and writing, and looking out of the window
in his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) own book-room, which fronted the road. The room in which
the ladies sat was backwards. Elizabeth had at first rather
wondered that Charlotte should not prefer the dining-parlour for
common use; it was a better sized room, and had a more pleasant
aspect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend had an excellent reason
for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) did, for Mr. Collins would undoubtedly have been
much less in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own apartment, had they sat in one equally
lively; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gave Charlotte credit for the arrangement.

<p/>From the drawing-room they could distinguish nothing in the lane,
and were indebted to Mr. Collins for the knowledge of what
carriages went along, and how often especially Miss de Bourgh
drove by in her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) phaeton, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) never failed coming to inform
them of, though it happened almost every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) not
unfrequently stopped at the Parsonage, and had a few minutes’
conversation with Charlotte, but was scarcely ever prevailed upon
to get out.

<p/>Very few days passed in which Mr. Collins did not walk to
Rosings, and not many in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife did not think it
necessary to go likewise; and till Elizabeth recollected that
there might be other family livings to be disposed of, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
not understand the sacrifice of so many hours. Now and then they
were honoured with a call from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship, and nothing escaped
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observation that was passing in the room during these visits.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) examined into their employments, looked at their work, and
advised them to do it differently; found fault with the
arrangement of the furniture; or detected the housemaid in
negligence; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) accepted any refreshment, seemed to do it
only for the sake of finding out that Mrs. Collins’s joints of
meat were too large for her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family.

<p/>Elizabeth soon perceived, that though this great lady was not in
the commission of the peace of the county, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a most active
magistrate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own parish, the minutest concerns of which were
carried to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) by Mr. Collins; and whenever any of the cottagers
were disposed to be quarrelsome, discontented, or too poor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sallied forth into the village to settle their differences,
silence their complaints, and scold them into harmony and plenty.

<p/>The entertainment of dining at Rosings was repeated about twice a
week; and, allowing for the loss of Sir William, and there being
only one card-table in the evening, every such entertainment was
the counterpart of the first. Their other engagements were few,
as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond
Mr. Collins’s reach. This, however, was no evil to Elizabeth, and
upon the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) time comfortably enough; there were
half-hours of pleasant conversation with Charlotte, and the
weather was so fine for the time of year that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) had often great
enjoyment out of doors. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) favourite walk, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
frequently went while the others were calling on Lady Catherine,
was along the open grove which edged that side of the park, where
there was a nice sheltered path, which no one seemed to value but
herself, and where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt beyond the reach of Lady Catherine’s
curiosity.

<p/>In this quiet way, the first fortnight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visit soon passed
away. Easter was approaching, and the week preceding it was to
bring an addition to the family at Rosings, which in so small a
circle must be important. Elizabeth had heard soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
arrival that Mr. Darcy was expected there in the course of a few
weeks, and though there were not many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) acquaintances whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not prefer, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming would furnish one comparatively
new to look at in their Rosings parties, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be amused
in seeing how hopeless Miss Bingley’s designs on him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) were, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
behaviour to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin, for whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was evidently destined by
Lady Catherine, who talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming with the greatest
satisfaction, spoke of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in terms of the highest admiration,
and seemed almost angry to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had already been
frequently seen by Miss Lucas and herself.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival was soon known at the Parsonage; for Mr. Collins was
walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into
Hunsford Lane, in order to have the earliest assurance of it, and
after making his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) bow as the carriage turned into the Park,
hurried home with the great intelligence. On the following
morning he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hastened to Rosings to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) respects. There were
two nephews of Lady Catherine to require them, for Mr. Darcy had
brought with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a Colonel Fitzwilliam, the younger son of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
uncle Lord ——, and, to the great surprise of all the party, when
Mr. Collins returned, the gentlemen accompanied him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). Charlotte
had seen them from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband’s room, crossing the road, and
immediately running into the other, told the girls what an honour
they might expect, adding:

<p/>"I may thank you, Eliza, for this piece of civility. Mr. Darcy
would never have come so soon to wait upon me."

<p/>Elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the
compliment, before their approach was announced by the door-bell,
and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room.
Colonel Fitzwilliam, who led the way, was about thirty, not
handsome, but in person and address most truly the gentleman. Mr.
Darcy looked just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been used to look in
Hertfordshire—paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) compliments, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) usual reserve, to
Mrs. Collins, and whatever might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) feelings toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
friend, met her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with every appearance of composure. Elizabeth
merely curtseyed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) without saying a word.

<p/>Colonel Fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the
readiness and ease of a well-bred man, and talked very
pleasantly; but his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cousin, after having addressed a slight
observation on the house and garden to Mrs. Collins, sat for some
time without speaking to anybody. At length, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
civility was so far awakened as to enquire of Elizabeth after the
health of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in the usual way, and
after a moment’s pause, added:

<p/>"My eldest sister has been in town these three months. Have you
never happened to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) there?"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was perfectly sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) never had; but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wished to
see whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would betray any consciousness of what had passed
between the Bingleys and Jane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) looked a little
confused as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) answered that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been so fortunate as to
meet Miss Bennet. The subject was pursued no farther, and the
gentlemen soon afterwards went away.
