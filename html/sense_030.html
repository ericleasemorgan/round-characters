<p/>Mrs. Jennings came immediately to their room on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) return, and without
waiting to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) request of admittance answered, opened the door and
walked in with a look of real concern.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How do you do my dear?" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in a voice of great compassion to
Marianne, who turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face without attempting to answer.

<p/>"How is she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), Miss Dashwood? Poor thing! she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) looks very bad. No wonder.
Ay, it is but too true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is to be married very soon—a
good-for-nothing fellow! I have no patience with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>). Mrs. Taylor told
me of it half an hour ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was told it by a particular friend
of Miss Grey herself, else I am sure I should not have believed it; and
I was almost ready to sink as it was. Well, said I, all I can say is,
that if this be true, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has used a young lady of my acquaintance
abominably ill, and I wish with all my soul his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife may plague his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
heart out. And so I shall always say, my dear, you may depend on it. I
have no notion of men’s going on in this way; and if ever I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
again, I will give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) such a dressing as he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) has not had this many a
day. But there is one comfort, my dear Miss Marianne; he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is not the
only young man in the world worth having; and with your pretty face you
will never want admirers. Well, poor thing! I won’t disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) any
longer, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had better have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cry out at once and have done with.
The Parrys and Sandersons luckily are coming tonight you know, and that
will amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) then went away, walking on tiptoe out of the room, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) young friend’s affliction could be increased by noise.

<p/>Marianne, to the surprise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, determined on dining with
them. Elinor even advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) against it. But <div class="bookquote">"no, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would go down;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could bear it very well, and the bustle about her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would be less."
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>Elinor, pleased to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) governed for a moment by such a motive,
though believing it hardly possible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could sit out the dinner,
said no more; and adjusting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dress for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could,
while Marianne still remained on the bed, was ready to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into
the dining room as soon as they were summoned to it.

<p/>When there, though looking most wretchedly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ate more and was calmer
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister had expected. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tried to speak, or had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) been
conscious of half Mrs. Jennings’s well-meant but ill-judged attentions
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), this calmness could not have been maintained; but not a
syllable escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) lips; and the abstraction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) thoughts
preserved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in ignorance of every thing that was passing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor, who did justice to Mrs. Jennings’s kindness, though its
effusions were often distressing, and sometimes almost ridiculous, made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) those acknowledgments, and returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) those civilities, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
sister could not make or return for herself. Their good friend saw that
Marianne was unhappy, and felt that every thing was due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) which
might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) at all less so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) therefore, with all the
indulgent fondness of a parent towards a favourite child on the last
day of its holidays. Marianne was to have the best place by the fire,
was to be tempted to eat by every delicacy in the house, and to be
amused by the relation of all the news of the day. Had not Elinor, in
the sad countenance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, seen a check to all mirth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
have been entertained by Mrs. Jennings’s endeavours to cure a
disappointment in love, by a variety of sweetmeats and olives, and a
good fire. As soon, however, as the consciousness of all this was
forced by continual repetition on Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could stay no longer.
With a hasty exclamation of Misery, and a sign to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister not to
follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directly got up and hurried out of the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor soul!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was gone, <div class="bookquote">"how it
grieves me to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)! And I declare if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) is not gone away without
finishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wine! And the dried cherries too! Lord! nothing seems to
do her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) any good. I am sure if I knew of any thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) would like, I
would send all over the town for it. Well, it is the oddest thing to
me, that a man should use such a pretty girl so ill! But when there is
plenty of money on one side, and next to none on the other, Lord bless
you! they care no more about such things!—"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"The lady then—Miss Grey I think you called her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)—is very rich?"

<p/>"Fifty thousand pounds, my dear. Did you ever see her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)? a smart, stylish
girl they say, but not handsome. I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt very well, Biddy
Henshawe; she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) married a very wealthy man. But the family are all rich
together. Fifty thousand pounds! and by all accounts, it won’t come
before it’s wanted; for they say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is all to pieces. No wonder!
dashing about with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) curricle and hunters! Well, it don’t signify
talking; but when a young man, be who he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will, comes and makes love to
a pretty girl, and promises marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no business to fly off
from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) word only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) grows poor, and a richer girl is ready to
have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Why don’t he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), in such a case, sell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horses, let his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) house,
turn off his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) servants, and make a thorough reform at once? I warrant
you, Miss Marianne would have been ready to wait till matters came
round. But that won’t do now-a-days; nothing in the way of pleasure can
ever be given up by the young men of this age."

<p/>"Do you know what kind of a girl Miss Grey is? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) said to be
amiable?"

<p/>"I never heard any harm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>); indeed I hardly ever heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>)
mentioned; except that Mrs. Taylor did say this morning, that one day
Miss Walker hinted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Walker</b></font>) believed Mr. and Mrs. Ellison would
not be sorry to have Miss Grey married, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) and Mrs. Ellison could
never agree."

<p/>"And who are the Ellisons?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) guardians, my dear. But now she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) is of age and may choose for
herself; and a pretty choice she (<font color='blue'><b>Grey</b></font>) has made!—What now,"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>after pausing a
moment—"your poor sister is gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own room, I suppose, to moan by
herself. Is there nothing one can get to comfort her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)? Poor dear, it
seems quite cruel to let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) be alone. Well, by-and-by we shall have a
few friends, and that will amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a little. What shall we play at?
She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) hates whist I know; but is there no round game she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cares for?"

<p/>"Dear ma’am, this kindness is quite unnecessary. Marianne, I dare say,
will not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) room again this evening. I shall persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) if I
can to go early to bed, for I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wants rest."

<p/>"Aye, I believe that will be best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) name her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own supper,
and go to bed. Lord! no wonder she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has been looking so bad and so cast
down this last week or two, for this matter I suppose has been hanging
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head as long as that. And so the letter that came today
finished it! Poor soul! I am sure if I had had a notion of it, I would
not have joked her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) about it for all my money. But then you know, how
should I guess such a thing? I made sure of its being nothing but a
common love letter, and you know young people like to be laughed at
about them. Lord! how concerned Sir John and my daughters will be when
they hear it! If I had my senses about me I might have called in
Conduit Street in my way home, and told them of it. But I shall see
them tomorrow."

<p/>"It would be unnecessary I am sure, for you to caution Mrs. Palmer and
Sir John against ever naming Mr. Willoughby, or making the slightest
allusion to what has passed, before my sister. Their own good-nature
must point out to them the real cruelty of appearing to know any thing
about it when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is present; and the less that may ever be said to
myself on the subject, the more my feelings will be spared, as you my
dear madam will easily believe."

<p/>"Oh! Lord! yes, that I do indeed. It must be terrible for you to hear
it talked of; and as for your sister, I am sure I would not mention a
word about it to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) for the world. You saw I did not all dinner time.
No more would Sir John, nor my daughters, for they are all very
thoughtful and considerate; especially if I give them a hint, as I
certainly will. For my part, I think the less that is said about such
things, the better, the sooner ’tis blown over and forgot. And what
good does talking ever do you know?"

<p/>"In this affair it can only do harm; more so perhaps than in many cases
of a similar kind, for it has been attended by circumstances which, for
the sake of every one concerned in it, make it unfit to become the
public conversation. I must do _this_ justice to Mr. Willoughby—he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has
broken no positive engagement with my sister."

<p/>"Law, my dear! Don’t pretend to defend him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). No positive engagement
indeed! after taking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) all over Allenham House, and fixing on the
very rooms they were to live in hereafter!"

<p/>Elinor, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s sake, could not press the subject farther, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped it was not required of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for Willoughby’s; since, though
Marianne might lose much, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could gain very little by the enforcement
of the real truth. After a short silence on both sides, Mrs. Jennings,
with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) natural hilarity, burst forth again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, my dear, ’tis a true saying about an ill-wind, for it will be
all the better for Colonel Brandon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) will have her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) at last; aye, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) will. Mind me, now, if they an’t married by Mid-summer. Lord! how
he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>)’ll chuckle over this news! I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will come tonight. It will be
all to one a better match for your sister. Two thousand a year without
debt or drawback—except the little love-child, indeed; aye, I had
forgot her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may be ’ (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>prenticed out at a small cost, and then
what does it signify? Delaford is a nice place, I can tell you; exactly
what I call a nice old fashioned place, full of comforts and
conveniences; quite shut in with great garden walls that are covered
with the best fruit-trees in the country; and such a mulberry tree in
one corner! Lord! how Charlotte and I did stuff the only time we were
there! Then, there is a dove-cote, some delightful stew-ponds, and a
very pretty canal; and every thing, in short, that one could wish for;
and, moreover, it is close to the church, and only a quarter of a mile
from the turnpike-road, so ’tis never dull, for if you only go and sit
up in an old yew arbour behind the house, you may see all the carriages
that pass along. Oh! ’tis a nice place! A butcher hard by in the
village, and the parsonage-house within a stone’s throw. To my fancy, a
thousand times prettier than Barton Park, where they are forced to send
three miles for their meat, and have not a neighbour nearer than your
mother. Well, I shall spirit up the Colonel as soon as I can. One
shoulder of mutton, you know, drives another down. If we _can_ but put
Willoughby out of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) head!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ay, if we can do _that_, Ma’am,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "we shall do very well
with or without Colonel Brandon.<div class="bookquote">" And then rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) went away to
join Marianne, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expected, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own room,
leaning, in silent misery, over the small remains of a fire, which,
till Elinor’s entrance, had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only light.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You had better leave me,<div class="bookquote">" was all the notice that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister received
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>I will leave you," said Elinor, "if you will go to bed." But this,
from the momentary perverseness of impatient suffering, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at first
refused to do. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s earnest, though gentle persuasion, however,
soon softened her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to compliance, and Elinor saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) lay her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) aching head
on the pillow, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped, in a way to get some quiet rest before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>In the drawing-room, whither she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then repaired, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was soon joined by
Mrs. Jennings, with a wine-glass, full of something, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), entering, "I have just recollected that I have
some of the finest old Constantia wine in the house that ever was
tasted, so I have brought a glass of it for your sister. My poor
husband! how fond he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was of it! Whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a touch of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) old
colicky gout, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said it did him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) more good than any thing else in the
world. Do take it to your sister."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear Ma’am,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, smiling at the difference of the
complaints for which it was recommended, "how good you are! But I have
just left Marianne in bed, and, I hope, almost asleep; and as I think
nothing will be of so much service to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as rest, if you will give me
leave, I will drink the wine myself."

<p/>Mrs. Jennings, though regretting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had not been five minutes
earlier, was satisfied with the compromise; and Elinor, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
swallowed the chief of it, reflected, that though its effects on a
colicky gout were, at present, of little importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), its healing
powers, on a disappointed heart might be as reasonably tried on herself
as on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Colonel Brandon came in while the party were at tea, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) manner
of looking round the room for Marianne, Elinor immediately fancied that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) neither expected nor wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) there, and, in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was already aware of what occasioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence. Mrs. Jennings was not
struck by the same thought; for soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) entrance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) walked
across the room to the tea-table where Elinor presided, and whispered,
"The Colonel looks as grave as ever you see. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) knows nothing of it; do
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), my dear.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) shortly afterwards drew a chair close to hers, and, with a look
which perfectly assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) good information, inquired after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>Marianne is not well," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). "She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has been indisposed all day, and
we have persuaded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to go to bed."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps, then,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hesitatingly replied, "what I heard this morning
may be—there may be more truth in it than I could believe possible at
first."

<p/>"What did you hear?"

<p/>"That a gentleman, whom I had reason to think—in short, that a man,
whom I _knew_ to be engaged—but how shall I tell you? If you know it
already, as surely you must, I may be spared."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You mean,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, with forced calmness, "Mr. Willoughby’s
marriage with Miss Grey. Yes, we _do_ know it all. This seems to have
been a day of general elucidation, for this very morning first unfolded
it to us. Mr. Willoughby is unfathomable! Where did you hear it?"

<p/>"In a stationer’s shop in Pall Mall, where I had business. Two ladies
were waiting for their carriage, and one of them was giving the other
an account of the intended match, in a voice so little attempting
concealment, that it was impossible for me not to hear all. The name of
Willoughby, John Willoughby, frequently repeated, first caught my
attention; and what followed was a positive assertion that every thing
was now finally settled respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage with Miss Grey—it was
no longer to be a secret—it would take place even within a few weeks,
with many particulars of preparations and other matters. One thing,
especially, I remember, because it served to identify the man still
more:—as soon as the ceremony was over, they were to go to Combe Magna,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) seat in Somersetshire. My astonishment!—but it would be impossible
to describe what I felt. The communicative lady I learnt, on inquiry,
for I stayed in the shop till they were gone, was a Mrs. Ellison, and
that, as I have been since informed, is the name of Miss Grey’s
guardian."

<p/>"It is. But have you likewise heard that Miss Grey has fifty thousand
pounds? In that, if in any thing, we may find an explanation."

<p/>"It may be so; but Willoughby is capable—at least I think"—he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) stopped a
moment; then added in a voice which seemed to distrust itself, <div class="bookquote">"And
your sister—how did she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)—"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sufferings have been very severe. I have only to hope that they
may be proportionately short. It has been, it is a most cruel
affliction. Till yesterday, I believe, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) never doubted his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) regard;
and even now, perhaps—but _I_ am almost convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) never was
really attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has been very deceitful! and, in some
points, there seems a hardness of heart about him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah!"  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Brandon, "there is, indeed! But your sister does
not—I think you said so—she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) does not consider quite as you do?"

<p/>"You know her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) disposition, and may believe how eagerly she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would still
justify him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) made no answer; and soon afterwards, by the removal of the
tea-things, and the arrangement of the card parties, the subject was
necessarily dropped. Mrs. Jennings, who had watched them with pleasure
while they were talking, and who expected to see the effect of Miss
Dashwood’s communication, in such an instantaneous gaiety on Colonel
Brandon’s side, as might have become a man in the bloom of youth, of
hope and happiness, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with amazement, remain the whole evening
more serious and thoughtful than usual.
