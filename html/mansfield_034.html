<p/>Edmund had great things to hear on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return. Many surprises were
awaiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). The first that occurred was not least in interest: the
appearance of Henry Crawford and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister walking together through
the village as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) rode into it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had concluded—he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had meant them to
be far distant. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) absence had been extended beyond a fortnight
purposely to avoid Miss Crawford. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was returning to Mansfield with
spirits ready to feed on melancholy remembrances, and tender
associations, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own fair self was before him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), leaning on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
brother’s arm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found himself receiving a welcome, unquestionably
friendly, from the woman whom, two moments before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been thinking
of as seventy miles off, and as farther, much farther, from him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) in
inclination than any distance could express.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) reception of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was of a sort which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not have hoped for,
had he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) expected to see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Coming as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did from such a purport
fulfilled as had taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would have expected anything rather
than a look of satisfaction, and words of simple, pleasant meaning. It
was enough to set his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart in a glow, and to bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) home in the
properest state for feeling the full value of the other joyful
surprises at hand.

<p/>William’s promotion, with all its particulars, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was soon master of;
and with such a secret provision of comfort within his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) own breast to
help the joy, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) found in it a source of most gratifying sensation and
unvarying cheerfulness all dinner-time.

<p/>After dinner, when he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father were alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had Fanny’s
history; and then all the great events of the last fortnight, and the
present situation of matters at Mansfield were known to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>Fanny suspected what was going on. They sat so much longer than usual
in the dining-parlour, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sure they must be talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>);
and when tea at last brought them away, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was to be seen by
Edmund again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt dreadfully guilty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), sat down by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and pressed it kindly; and at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought that, but for the occupation and the scene which the tea-things
afforded, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) emotion in some unpardonable
excess.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was not intending, however, by such action, to be conveying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
that unqualified approbation and encouragement which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hopes drew
from it. It was designed only to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) participation in all that
interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been hearing what quickened
every feeling of affection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was, in fact, entirely on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father’s
side of the question. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) surprise was not so great as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father’s at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) refusing Crawford, because, so far from supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to consider
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) with anything like a preference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had always believed it to be
rather the reverse, and could imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be taken perfectly
unprepared, but Sir Thomas could not regard the connexion as more
desirable than he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) did. It had every recommendation to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); and while
honouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had done under the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) present
indifference, honouring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in rather stronger terms than Sir Thomas
could quite echo, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was most earnest in hoping, and sanguine in
believing, that it would be a match at last, and that, united by mutual
affection, it would appear that their dispositions were as exactly
fitted to make them blessed in each other, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was now beginning
seriously to consider them. Crawford had been too precipitate. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
not given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time to attach herself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had begun at the wrong end.
With such powers as his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), however, and such a disposition as hers,
Edmund trusted that everything would work out a happy conclusion.
Meanwhile, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw enough of Fanny’s embarrassment to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
scrupulously guard against exciting it a second time, by any word, or
look, or movement.

<p/>Crawford called the next day, and on the score of Edmund’s return, Sir
Thomas felt himself more than licensed to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to stay dinner; it
was really a necessary compliment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) staid of course, and Edmund had
then ample opportunity for observing how he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sped with Fanny, and what
degree of immediate encouragement for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might be extracted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
manners; and it was so little, so very, very little—every chance, every
possibility of it, resting upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) embarrassment only; if there was
not hope in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confusion, there was hope in nothing else—that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was
almost ready to wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend’s perseverance. Fanny was worth it
all; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) held her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be worth every effort of patience, every exertion
of mind, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have gone on himself with any
woman breathing, without something more to warm his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) courage than his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
eyes could discern in hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was very willing to hope that Crawford
saw clearer, and this was the most comfortable conclusion for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
friend that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could come to from all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) observed to pass before,
and at, and after dinner.

<p/>In the evening a few circumstances occurred which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought more
promising. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and Crawford walked into the drawing-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
mother and Fanny were sitting as intently and silently at work as if
there were nothing else to care for. Edmund could not help noticing
their apparently deep tranquillity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We have not been so silent all the time,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother. <div class="bookquote">"Fanny
has been reading to me, and only put the book down upon hearing you
coming."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And sure enough there was a book on the table which had the
air of being very recently closed: a volume of Shakespeare. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) often
reads to me out of those books; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the middle of a very
fine speech of that man’s—what’s his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name, Fanny?—when we heard your
footsteps.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Crawford took the volume. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Let me have the pleasure of finishing that
speech to your ladyship," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). "I shall find it immediately." And
by carefully giving way to the inclination of the leaves, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did find
it, or within a page or two, quite near enough to satisfy Lady Bertram,
who assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mentioned the name of Cardinal Wolsey,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had got the very speech. Not a look or an offer of help had
Fanny given; not a syllable for or against. All her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention was for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seemed determined to be interested by nothing else. But
taste was too strong in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not abstract her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind five
minutes: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was forced to listen; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) reading was capital, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
pleasure in good reading extreme. To _good_ reading, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
been long used: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle read well, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins all, Edmund very well,
but in Mr. Crawford’s reading there was a variety of excellence beyond
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever met with. The King, the Queen, Buckingham, Wolsey,
Cromwell, all were given in turn; for with the happiest knack, the
happiest power of jumping and guessing, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could always alight at will
on the best scene, or the best speeches of each; and whether it were
dignity, or pride, or tenderness, or remorse, or whatever were to be
expressed, he (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could do it with equal beauty. It was truly dramatic. His (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
acting had first taught Fanny what pleasure a play might give, and his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
reading brought all his (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) acting before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) again; nay, perhaps with
greater enjoyment, for it came unexpectedly, and with no such drawback
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been used to suffer in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) on the stage with Miss
Bertram.

<p/>Edmund watched the progress of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) attention, and was amused and
gratified by seeing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) gradually slackened in the needlework,
which at the beginning seemed to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) totally: how it fell from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) hand while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sat motionless over it, and at last, how the eyes
which had appeared so studiously to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) throughout the day were
turned and fixed on Crawford—fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for minutes, fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), in
short, till the attraction drew Crawford’s upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), and the book was
closed, and the charm was broken. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was shrinking again into
herself, and blushing and working as hard as ever; but it had been
enough to give Edmund encouragement for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) friend, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cordially
thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hoped to be expressing Fanny’s secret feelings too.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That play must be a favourite with you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"you read as if you
knew it well."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"It will be a favourite, I believe, from this hour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Crawford;
"but I do not think I have had a volume of Shakespeare in my hand
before since I was fifteen. I once saw Henry the Eighth acted, or I
have heard of it from somebody who did, I am not certain which. But
Shakespeare one gets acquainted with without knowing how. It is a part
of an Englishman’s constitution. His (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) thoughts and beauties are so
spread abroad that one touches them everywhere; one is intimate with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Englishman</b></font>) by instinct. No man of any brain can open at a good part of one of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) plays without falling into the flow of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) meaning immediately."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No doubt one is familiar with Shakespeare in a degree,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund,
"from one’s earliest years. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) celebrated passages are quoted by
everybody; they are in half the books we open, and we all talk
Shakespeare, use his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) similes, and describe with his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) descriptions; but
this is totally distinct from giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) sense as you gave it. To know
him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) in bits and scraps is common enough; to know him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) pretty thoroughly
is, perhaps, not uncommon; but to read him (<font color='blue'><b>Shakespeare</b></font>) well aloud is no everyday
talent."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Sir, you do me honour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>was Crawford’s answer, with a bow of mock
gravity.

<p/>Both gentlemen had a glance at Fanny, to see if a word of accordant
praise could be extorted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); yet both feeling that it could not
be. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise had been given in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention; _that_ must content
them.

<p/>Lady Bertram’s admiration was expressed, and strongly too. <div class="bookquote">"It was
really like being at a play,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"I wish Sir Thomas had been
here."

 (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div><p/>Crawford was excessively pleased. If Lady Bertram, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
incompetency and languor, could feel this, the inference of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
niece, alive and enlightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was, must feel, was elevating.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have a great turn for acting, I am sure, Mr. Crawford,"  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
ladyship soon afterwards; "and I will tell you what, I think you will
have a theatre, some time or other, at your house in Norfolk. I mean
when you are settled there. I do indeed. I think you will fit up a
theatre at your house in Norfolk."

<p/>"Do you, ma’am?<div class="bookquote">" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), with quickness. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, no, that will never be.
Your ladyship is quite mistaken. No theatre at Everingham! Oh no!" And
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked at Fanny with an expressive smile, which evidently meant,
"That lady will never allow a theatre at Everingham."

<p/>Edmund saw it all, and saw Fanny so determined _not_ to see it, as to
make it clear that the voice was enough to convey the full meaning of
the protestation; and such a quick consciousness of compliment, such a
ready comprehension of a hint, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) thought, was rather favourable than
not.

<p/>The subject of reading aloud was farther discussed. The two young men
were the only talkers, but they, standing by the fire, talked over the
too common neglect of the qualification, the total inattention to it,
in the ordinary school-system for boys, the consequently natural, yet
in some instances almost unnatural, degree of ignorance and uncouthness
of men, of sensible and well-informed men, when suddenly called to the
necessity of reading aloud, which had fallen within their notice,
giving instances of blunders, and failures with their secondary causes,
the want of management of the voice, of proper modulation and emphasis,
of foresight and judgment, all proceeding from the first cause: want of
early attention and habit; and Fanny was listening again with great
entertainment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Even in my profession,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with a smile, "how little the art
of reading has been studied! how little a clear manner, and good
delivery, have been attended to! I speak rather of the past, however,
than the present. There is now a spirit of improvement abroad; but
among those who were ordained twenty, thirty, forty years ago, the
larger number, to judge by their performance, must have thought reading
was reading, and preaching was preaching. It is different now. The
subject is more justly considered. It is felt that distinctness and
energy may have weight in recommending the most solid truths; and
besides, there is more general observation and taste, a more critical
knowledge diffused than formerly; in every congregation there is a
larger proportion who know a little of the matter, and who can judge
and criticise."

<p/>Edmund had already gone through the service once since his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) ordination;
and upon this being understood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had a variety of questions from
Crawford as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) feelings and success; questions, which being made,
though with the vivacity of friendly interest and quick taste, without
any touch of that spirit of banter or air of levity which Edmund knew
to be most offensive to Fanny, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had true pleasure in satisfying; and
when Crawford proceeded to ask his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) opinion and give his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own as to the
properest manner in which particular passages in the service should be
delivered, shewing it to be a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had thought before,
and thought with judgment, Edmund was still more and more pleased. This
would be the way to Fanny’s heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not to be won by all that
gallantry and wit and good-nature together could do; or, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
would not be won by them nearly so soon, without the assistance of
sentiment and feeling, and seriousness on serious subjects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Our liturgy,"  (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>observed Crawford, "has beauties, which not even a
careless, slovenly style of reading can destroy; but it has also
redundancies and repetitions which require good reading not to be felt.
For myself, at least, I must confess being not always so attentive as I
ought to be" (here was a glance at Fanny); "that nineteen times out of
twenty I am thinking how such a prayer ought to be read, and longing to
have it to read myself. Did you speak?" stepping eagerly to Fanny, and
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a softened voice; and upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saying <div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) added,
"Are you sure you did not speak? I saw your lips move. I fancied you
might be going to tell me I ought to be more attentive, and not _allow_
my thoughts to wander. Are not you going to tell me so?"

<p/>"No, indeed, you know your duty too well for me to—even supposing—"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) stopt, felt herself getting into a puzzle, and could not be
prevailed on to add another word, not by dint of several minutes of
supplication and waiting. He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) then returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) former station, and
went on as if there had been no such tender interruption.

<p/>"A sermon, well delivered, is more uncommon even than prayers well
read. A sermon, good in itself, is no rare thing. It is more difficult
to speak well than to compose well; that is, the rules and trick of
composition are oftener an object of study. A thoroughly good sermon,
thoroughly well delivered, is a capital gratification. I can never hear
such a one without the greatest admiration and respect, and more than
half a mind to take orders and preach myself. There is something in the
eloquence of the pulpit, when it is really eloquence, which is entitled
to the highest praise and honour. The preacher who can touch and affect
such an heterogeneous mass of hearers, on subjects limited, and long
worn threadbare in all common hands; who can say anything new or
striking, anything that rouses the attention without offending the
taste, or wearing out the feelings of his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) hearers, is a man whom one
could not, in his (<font color='blue'><b>preacher</b></font>) public capacity, honour enough. I should like to be
such a man.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Edmund laughed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should indeed. I never listened to a distinguished preacher in my
life without a sort of envy. But then, I must have a London audience. I
could not preach but to the educated; to those who were capable of
estimating my composition. And I do not know that I should be fond of
preaching often; now and then, perhaps once or twice in the spring,
after being anxiously expected for half a dozen Sundays together; but
not for a constancy; it would not do for a constancy."

<p/>Here Fanny, who could not but listen, involuntarily shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, and
Crawford was instantly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side again, entreating to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
meaning; and as Edmund perceived, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) drawing in a chair, and
sitting down close by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that it was to be a very thorough attack,
that looks and undertones were to be well tried, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sank as quietly as
possible into a corner, turned his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) back, and took up a newspaper, very
sincerely wishing that dear little Fanny might be persuaded into
explaining away that shake of the head to the satisfaction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
ardent lover; and as earnestly trying to bury every sound of the
business from himself in murmurs of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) own, over the various
advertisements of <div class="bookquote">"A most desirable Estate in South Wales" (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>; <div class="bookquote">"To Parents
and Guardians" (<font color='red'><b>lover</b></font>)</div>; and a "Capital season’d Hunter.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny, meanwhile, vexed with herself for not having been as motionless
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was speechless, and grieved to the heart to see Edmund’s
arrangements, was trying by everything in the power of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) modest,
gentle nature, to repulse Mr. Crawford, and avoid both his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looks and
inquiries; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), unrepulsable, was persisting in both.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What did that shake of the head mean?" said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). "What was it meant to
express? Disapprobation, I fear. But of what? What had I been saying to
displease you? Did you think me speaking improperly, lightly,
irreverently on the subject? Only tell me if I was. Only tell me if I
was wrong. I want to be set right. Nay, nay, I entreat you; for one
moment put down your work. What did that shake of the head mean?"

<p/>In vain was her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) "Pray, sir, don’t; pray, Mr. Crawford," repeated twice
over; and in vain did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) try to move away. In the same low, eager
voice, and the same close neighbourhood, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) went on, reurging the same
questions as before. She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) grew more agitated and displeased.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How can you, sir? You quite astonish me; I wonder how you can—"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Do I astonish you?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). "Do you wonder? Is there anything in my
present entreaty that you do not understand? I will explain to you
instantly all that makes me urge you in this manner, all that gives me
an interest in what you look and do, and excites my present curiosity.
I will not leave you to wonder long.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>In spite of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could not help half a smile, but she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said
nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You shook your head at my acknowledging that I should not like to
engage in the duties of a clergyman always for a constancy. Yes, that
was the word. Constancy: I am not afraid of the word. I would spell it,
read it, write it with anybody. I see nothing alarming in the word. Did
you think I ought?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, wearied at last into speaking—"perhaps,
sir, I thought it was a pity you did not always know yourself as well
as you seemed to do at that moment."

<p/>Crawford, delighted to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to speak at any rate, was determined to
keep it up; and poor Fanny, who had hoped to silence him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by such an
extremity of reproof, found herself sadly mistaken, and that it was
only a change from one object of curiosity and one set of words to
another. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had always something to entreat the explanation of. The
opportunity was too fair. None such had occurred since his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s room, none such might occur again before his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) leaving
Mansfield. Lady Bertram’s being just on the other side of the table was
a trifle, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) might always be considered as only half-awake, and
Edmund’s advertisements were still of the first utility.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Crawford, after a course of rapid questions and reluctant
answers; <div class="bookquote">"I am happier than I was, because I now understand more
clearly your opinion of me. You think me unsteady: easily swayed by the
whim of the moment, easily tempted, easily put aside. With such an
opinion, no wonder that—But we shall see.—It is not by protestations
that I shall endeavour to convince you I am wronged; it is not by
telling you that my affections are steady. My conduct shall speak for
me; absence, distance, time shall speak for me. _They_ shall prove
that, as far as you can be deserved by anybody, I do deserve you. You
are infinitely my superior in merit; all _that_ I know. You have
qualities which I had not before supposed to exist in such a degree in
any human creature. You have some touches of the angel in you beyond
what—not merely beyond what one sees, because one never sees anything
like it—but beyond what one fancies might be. But still I am not
frightened. It is not by equality of merit that you can be won. That is
out of the question. It is he (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) who sees and worships your merit the
strongest, who loves you most devotedly, that has the best right to a
return. There I build my confidence. By that right I do and will
deserve you; and when once convinced that my attachment is what I
declare it, I know you too well not to entertain the warmest hopes.
Yes, dearest, sweetest Fanny. Nay"  (<font color='red'><b>Crawford/Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>(seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) draw back displeased),
"forgive me. Perhaps I have as yet no right; but by what other name can
I call you? Do you suppose you are ever present to my imagination under
any other? No, it is <div class="bookquote">‘Fanny’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that I think of all day, and dream of all
night. You have given the name such reality of sweetness, that nothing
else can now be descriptive of you."

<p/>Fanny could hardly have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat any longer, or have refrained
from at least trying to get away in spite of all the too public
opposition she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) foresaw to it, had it not been for the sound of
approaching relief, the very sound which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been long watching
for, and long thinking strangely delayed.

<p/>The solemn procession, headed by Baddeley, of tea-board, urn, and
cake-bearers, made its appearance, and delivered her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from a grievous
imprisonment of body and mind. Mr. Crawford was obliged to move. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was at liberty, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was busy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was protected.

<p/>Edmund was not sorry to be admitted again among the number of those who
might speak and hear. But though the conference had seemed full long to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), and though on looking at Fanny he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw rather a flush of vexation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) inclined to hope that so much could not have been said and listened
to without some profit to the speaker.
