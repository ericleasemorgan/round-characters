<p/>Catherine’s disposition was not naturally sedentary, nor had her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) habits
been ever very industrious; but whatever might hitherto have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
defects of that sort, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother could not but perceive them now to be
greatly increased. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could neither sit still nor employ herself for
ten minutes together, walking round the garden and orchard again and
again, as if nothing but motion was voluntary; and it seemed as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could even walk about the house rather than remain fixed for any time
in the parlour. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loss of spirits was a yet greater alteration. In
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) rambling and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) idleness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might only be a caricature of
herself; but in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) silence and sadness she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was the very reverse of all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been before.

<p/>For two days Mrs. Morland allowed it to pass even without a hint; but
when a third night’s rest had neither restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) cheerfulness,
improved her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) in useful activity, nor given her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) a greater inclination
for needlework, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could no longer refrain from the gentle reproof of,
"My dear Catherine, I am afraid you are growing quite a fine lady. I do
not know when poor Richard’s cravats would be done, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) had no friend
but you. Your head runs too much upon Bath; but there is a time for
everything—a time for balls and plays, and a time for work. You have
had a long run of amusement, and now you must try to be useful."

<p/>Catherine took up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work directly, saying, in a dejected voice, that
"her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head did not run upon Bath—much."

<p/>"Then you are fretting about General Tilney, and that is very simple of
you; for ten to one whether you ever see him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) again. You should never
fret about trifles." After a short silence—"I hope, my Catherine, you
are not getting out of humour with home because it is not so grand as
Northanger. That would be turning your visit into an evil indeed.
Wherever you are you should always be contented, but especially at
home, because there you must spend the most of your time. I did not
quite like, at breakfast, to hear you talk so much about the French
bread at Northanger."

<p/>"I am sure I do not care about the bread. It is all the same to me what
I eat."

<p/>"There is a very clever essay in one of the books upstairs upon much
such a subject, about young girls that have been spoilt for home by
great acquaintance—The Mirror, I think. I will look it out for you some
day or other, because I am sure it will do you good."

<p/>Catherine said no more, and, with an endeavour to do right, applied to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) work; but, after a few minutes, sunk again, without knowing it
herself, into languor and listlessness, moving herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) chair,
from the irritation of weariness, much oftener than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) moved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
needle. Mrs. Morland watched the progress of this relapse; and seeing,
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) daughter’s absent and dissatisfied look, the full proof of that
repining spirit to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had now begun to attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) want of
cheerfulness, hastily left the room to fetch the book in question,
anxious to lose no time in attacking so dreadful a malady. It was some
time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) could find what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) looked for; and other family
matters occurring to detain her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), a quarter of an hour had elapsed ere
she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) returned downstairs with the volume from which so much was hoped.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) avocations above having shut out all noise but what she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) created
herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) knew not that a visitor had arrived within the last few
minutes, till, on entering the room, the first object she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) beheld was a
young man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had never seen before. With a look of much respect,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) immediately rose, and being introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) conscious
daughter as <div class="bookquote">"Mr. Henry Tilney,"  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>with the embarrassment of real
sensibility began to apologize for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) appearance there, acknowledging
that after what had passed he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had little right to expect a welcome at
Fullerton, and stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) impatience to be assured of Miss Morland’s
having reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) home in safety, as the cause of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intrusion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
did not address himself to an uncandid judge or a resentful heart. Far
from comprehending him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) or his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister in their father’s misconduct, Mrs.
Morland had been always kindly disposed towards each, and instantly,
pleased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) appearance, received him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) with the simple professions of
unaffected benevolence; thanking him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for such an attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
daughter, assuring him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) that the friends of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) children were always
welcome there, and entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to say not another word of the past.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was not ill-inclined to obey this request, for, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) heart was
greatly relieved by such unlooked-for mildness, it was not just at that
moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) power to say anything to the purpose. Returning in
silence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seat, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) remained for some minutes most
civilly answering all Mrs. Morland’s common remarks about the weather
and roads. Catherine meanwhile—the anxious, agitated, happy, feverish
Catherine—said not a word; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) glowing cheek and brightened eye
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother trust that this good-natured visit would at least set
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart at ease for a time, and gladly therefore did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lay aside
the first volume of The Mirror for a future hour.

<p/>Desirous of Mr. Morland’s assistance, as well in giving encouragement,
as in finding conversation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) guest, whose embarrassment on his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
father’s account she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) earnestly pitied, Mrs. Morland had very early
dispatched one of the children to summon him (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>); but Mr. Morland was from
home—and being thus without any support, at the end of a quarter of an
hour she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had nothing to say. After a couple of minutes’ unbroken
silence, Henry, turning to Catherine for the first time since her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
mother’s entrance, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), with sudden alacrity, if Mr. and Mrs.
Allen were now at Fullerton? And on developing, from amidst all her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
perplexity of words in reply, the meaning, which one short syllable
would have given, immediately expressed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intention of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
respects to them, and, with a rising colour, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would
have the goodness to show him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) the way. <div class="bookquote">"You may see the house from this
window, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div>was information on Sarah’s side, which produced only a
bow of acknowledgment from the gentleman, and a silencing nod from her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>)
mother; for Mrs. Morland, thinking it probable, as a secondary
consideration in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wish of waiting on their worthy neighbours, that
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might have some explanation to give of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father’s behaviour, which
it must be more pleasant for him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to communicate only to Catherine,
would not on any account prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) accompanying him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>). They began their
walk, and Mrs. Morland was not entirely mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) object in
wishing it. Some explanation on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) father’s account he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had to give;
but his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first purpose was to explain himself, and before they reached
Mr. Allen’s grounds he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had done it so well that Catherine did not think
it could ever be repeated too often. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) affection;
and that heart in return was solicited, which, perhaps, they pretty
equally knew was already entirely his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) own; for, though Henry was now
sincerely attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt and delighted in all the
excellencies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) character and truly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) society, I must
confess that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) affection originated in nothing better than gratitude,
or, in other words, that a persuasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had
been the only cause of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a serious thought. It is a new
circumstance in romance, I acknowledge, and dreadfully derogatory of an
heroine’s dignity; but if it be as new in common life, the credit of a
wild imagination will at least be all my own.

<p/>A very short visit to Mrs. Allen, in which Henry talked at random,
without sense or connection, and Catherine, rapt in the contemplation
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own unutterable happiness, scarcely opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips, dismissed
them to the ecstasies of another tête-à-tête; and before it was
suffered to close, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was enabled to judge how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was sanctioned
by parental authority in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) present application. On his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) return from
Woodston, two days before, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been met near the abbey by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
impatient father, hastily informed in angry terms of Miss Morland’s
departure, and ordered to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) no more.

<p/>Such was the permission upon which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had now offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) hand. The
affrighted Catherine, amidst all the terrors of expectation, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
listened to this account, could not but rejoice in the kind caution
with which Henry had saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from the necessity of a conscientious
rejection, by engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faith before he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) mentioned the subject; and
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) proceeded to give the particulars, and explain the motives of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
father’s conduct, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings soon hardened into even a triumphant
delight. The general had had nothing to accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) of, nothing to lay
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) charge, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being the involuntary, unconscious object of a
deception which his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pride could not pardon, and which a better pride
would have been ashamed to own. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was guilty only of being less rich
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to be. Under a mistaken persuasion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
possessions and claims, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had courted her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance in Bath,
solicited her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) company at Northanger, and designed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
daughter-in-law. On discovering his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) error, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) from the house
seemed the best, though to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) feelings an inadequate proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
resentment towards herself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) contempt of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family.

<p/>John Thorpe had first misled him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>). The general, perceiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son one
night at the theatre to be paying considerable attention to Miss
Morland, had accidentally inquired of Thorpe if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) knew more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) name. Thorpe, most happy to be on speaking terms with a man of
General Tilney’s importance, had been joyfully and proudly
communicative; and being at that time not only in daily expectation of
Morland’s engaging Isabella, but likewise pretty well resolved upon
marrying Catherine himself, his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vanity induced him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) to represent the
family as yet more wealthy than his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) vanity and avarice had made him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
believe them. With whomsoever he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was, or was likely to be connected,
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own consequence always required that theirs should be great, and as
his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) intimacy with any acquaintance grew, so regularly grew their
fortune. The expectations of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) friend Morland, therefore, from the
first overrated, had ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) introduction to Isabella been
gradually increasing; and by merely adding twice as much for the
grandeur of the moment, by doubling what he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) chose to think the amount
of Mr. Morland’s preferment, trebling his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) private fortune, bestowing a
rich aunt, and sinking half the children, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was able to represent the
whole family to the general in a most respectable light. For Catherine,
however, the peculiar object of the general’s curiosity, and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) own
speculations, he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had yet something more in reserve, and the ten or
fifteen thousand pounds which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would be a
pretty addition to Mr. Allen’s estate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) intimacy there had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
seriously determine on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being handsomely legacied hereafter; and to
speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) therefore as the almost acknowledged future heiress of
Fullerton naturally followed. Upon such intelligence the general had
proceeded; for never had it occurred to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) to doubt its authority.
Thorpe’s interest in the family, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) sister’s approaching connection
with one of its members, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own views on another (circumstances of
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) boasted with almost equal openness), seemed sufficient
vouchers for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) truth; and to these were added the absolute facts of
the Allens being wealthy and childless, of Miss Morland’s being under
their care, and—as soon as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) acquaintance allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to judge—of
their treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) with parental kindness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) resolution was soon
formed. Already had he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) discerned a liking towards Miss Morland in the
countenance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son; and thankful for Mr. Thorpe’s communication, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
almost instantly determined to spare no pains in weakening his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) boasted
interest and ruining his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) dearest hopes. Catherine herself could not be
more ignorant at the time of all this, than his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) own children. Henry and
Eleanor, perceiving nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) situation likely to engage their
father’s particular respect, had seen with astonishment the suddenness,
continuance, and extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) attention; and though latterly, from
some hints which had accompanied an almost positive command to his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son
of doing everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) power to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), Henry was convinced of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father’s believing it to be an advantageous connection, it was not
till the late explanation at Northanger that they had the smallest idea
of the false calculations which had hurried him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) on. That they were
false, the general had learnt from the very person who had suggested
them, from Thorpe himself, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had chanced to meet again in town,
and who, under the influence of exactly opposite feelings, irritated by
Catherine’s refusal, and yet more by the failure of a very recent
endeavour to accomplish a reconciliation between Morland and Isabella,
convinced that they were separated forever, and spurning a friendship
which could be no longer serviceable, hastened to contradict all that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had said before to the advantage of the Morlands—confessed himself
to have been totally mistaken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) opinion of their circumstances and
character, misled by the rhodomontade of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) friend to believe his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
father a man of substance and credit, whereas the transactions of the
two or three last weeks proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to be neither; for after coming
eagerly forward on the first overture of a marriage between the
families, with the most liberal proposals, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had, on being brought to
the point by the shrewdness of the relator, been constrained to
acknowledge himself incapable of giving the young people even a decent
support. They were, in fact, a necessitous family; numerous, too,
almost beyond example; by no means respected in their own
neighbourhood, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had lately had particular opportunities of
discovering; aiming at a style of life which their fortune could not
warrant; seeking to better themselves by wealthy connections; a
forward, bragging, scheming race.

<p/>The terrified general pronounced the name of Allen with an inquiring
look; and here too Thorpe had learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) error. The Allens, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
believed, had lived near them too long, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) knew the young man on
whom the Fullerton estate must devolve. The general needed no more.
Enraged with almost everybody in the world but himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) set out the
next day for the abbey, where his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) performances have been seen.

<p/>I leave it to my reader’s sagacity to determine how much of all this it
was possible for Henry to communicate at this time to Catherine, how
much of it he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) could have learnt from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father, in what points his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own
conjectures might assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and what portion must yet remain to be
told in a letter from James. I have united for their ease what they
must divide for mine. Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel that
in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had scarcely sinned against his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) character, or magnified his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
cruelty.

<p/>Henry, in having such things to relate of his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) father, was almost as
pitiable as in their first avowal to himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) blushed for the
narrow-minded counsel which he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) was obliged to expose. The conversation
between them at Northanger had been of the most unfriendly kind.
Henry’s indignation on hearing how Catherine had been treated, on
comprehending his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father’s views, and being ordered to acquiesce in
them, had been open and bold. The general, accustomed on every ordinary
occasion to give the law in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) family, prepared for no reluctance but
of feeling, no opposing desire that should dare to clothe itself in
words, could ill brook the opposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) son, steady as the
sanction of reason and the dictate of conscience could make it. But, in
such a cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) anger, though it must shock, could not intimidate
Henry, who was sustained in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) purpose by a conviction of its justice.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) felt himself bound as much in honour as in affection to Miss
Morland, and believing that heart to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own which he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been
directed to gain, no unworthy retraction of a tacit consent, no
reversing decree of unjustifiable anger, could shake his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) fidelity, or
influence the resolutions it prompted.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) steadily refused to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father into Herefordshire, an
engagement formed almost at the moment to promote the dismissal of
Catherine, and as steadily declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) intention of offering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
hand. The general was furious in his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) anger, and they parted in dreadful
disagreement. Henry, in an agitation of mind which many solitary hours
were required to compose, had returned almost instantly to Woodston,
and, on the afternoon of the following day, had begun his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) journey to
Fullerton.
