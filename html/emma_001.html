<p/>Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition, seemed to unite some of the best blessings of existence; and had lived nearly twenty-one years in the world with very little to distress or vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate, indulgent father; and had, in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) sister's marriage, been mistress of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house from a very early period. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mother had died too long ago for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to have more than an indistinct remembrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) caresses; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) place had been supplied by an excellent woman as governess, who had fallen little short of a mother in affection.

<p/>Sixteen years had Miss Taylor been in Mr. Woodhouse's family, less as a governess than a friend, very fond of both daughters, but particularly of Emma. Between them it was more the intimacy of sisters. Even before Miss Taylor had ceased to hold the nominal office of governess, the mildness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) temper had hardly allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to impose any restraint; and the shadow of authority being now long passed away, they had been living together as friend and friend very mutually attached, and Emma doing just what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked; highly esteeming Miss Taylor's judgment, but directed chiefly by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own.

<p/>The real evils, indeed, of Emma's situation were the power of having rather too much her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own way, and a disposition to think a little too well of herself; these were the disadvantages which threatened alloy to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many enjoyments. The danger, however, was at present so unperceived, that they did not by any means rank as misfortunes with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>Sorrow came—a gentle sorrow—but not at all in the shape of any disagreeable consciousness.—Miss Taylor married. It was Miss Taylor's loss which first brought grief. It was on the wedding-day of this beloved friend that Emma first sat in mournful thought of any continuance. The wedding over, and the bride-people gone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and herself were left to dine together, with no prospect of a third to cheer a long evening. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father composed himself to sleep after dinner, as usual, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had then only to sit and think of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had lost.

<p/>The event had every promise of happiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. Mr. Weston was a man of unexceptionable character, easy fortune, suitable age, and pleasant manners; and there was some satisfaction in considering with what self-denying, generous friendship she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had always wished and promoted the match; but it was a black morning's work for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The want of Miss Taylor would be felt every hour of every day. She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) past kindness—the kindness, the affection of sixteen years—how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had taught and how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had played with her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) from five years old—how she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had devoted all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) powers to attach and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in health—and how nursed her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) through the various illnesses of childhood. A large debt of gratitude was owing here; but the intercourse of the last seven years, the equal footing and perfect unreserve which had soon followed Isabella's marriage, on their being left to each other, was yet a dearer, tenderer recollection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had been a friend and companion such as few possessed: intelligent, well-informed, useful, gentle, knowing all the ways of the family, interested in all its concerns, and peculiarly interested in herself, in every pleasure, every scheme of hers—one to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could speak every thought as it arose, and who had such an affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) as could never find fault.

<p/>How was she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to bear the change?—It was true that her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend was going only half a mile from them; but Emma was aware that great must be the difference between a Mrs. Weston, only half a mile from them, and a Miss Taylor in the house; and with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) advantages, natural and domestic, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) was now in great danger of suffering from intellectual solitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) dearly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) father, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was no companion for her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could not meet her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in conversation, rational or playful.

<p/>The evil of the actual disparity in their ages (and Mr. Woodhouse had not married early) was much increased by his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) constitution and habits; for having been a valetudinarian all his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life, without activity of mind or body, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was a much older man in ways than in years; and though everywhere beloved for the friendliness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) heart and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) amiable temper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talents could not have recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) at any time.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) sister, though comparatively but little removed by matrimony, being settled in London, only sixteen miles off, was much beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) daily reach; and many a long October and November evening must be struggled through at Hartfield, before Christmas brought the next visit from Isabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) husband, and their little children, to fill the house, and give her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) pleasant society again.

<p/>Highbury, the large and populous village, almost amounting to a town, to which Hartfield, in spite of its separate lawn, and shrubberies, and name, did really belong, afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) no equals. The Woodhouses were first in consequence there. All looked up to them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had many acquaintance in the place, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father was universally civil, but not one among them who could be accepted in lieu of Miss Taylor for even half a day. It was a melancholy change; and Emma could not but sigh over it, and wish for impossible things, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father awoke, and made it necessary to be cheerful. His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits required support. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was a nervous man, easily depressed; fond of every body that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was used to, and hating to part with them; hating change of every kind. Matrimony, as the origin of change, was always disagreeable; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was by no means yet reconciled to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own daughter's marrying, nor could ever speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) but with compassion, though it had been entirely a match of affection, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was now obliged to part with Miss Taylor too; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habits of gentle selfishness, and of being never able to suppose that other people could feel differently from himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was very much disposed to think Miss Taylor had done as sad a thing for herself as for them, and would have been a great deal happier if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) had spent all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) life at Hartfield. Emma smiled and chatted as cheerfully as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from such thoughts; but when tea came, it was impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) not to say exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had said at dinner,

<p/>"Poor Miss Taylor!—I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) were here again. What a pity it is that Mr. Weston ever thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!"

<p/>"I cannot agree with you, papa; you know I cannot. Mr. Weston is such a good-humoured, pleasant, excellent man, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thoroughly deserves a good wife;—and you would not have had Miss Taylor live with us for ever, and bear all my odd humours, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) might have a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own?"

<p/>"A house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own!—But where is the advantage of a house of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own? This is three times as large.—And you have never any odd humours, my dear."

<p/>"How often we shall be going to see them, and they coming to see us!—We shall be always meeting! We must begin; we must go and pay wedding visit very soon."

<p/>"My dear, how am I to get so far? Randalls is such a distance. I could not walk half so far."

<p/>"No, papa, nobody thought of your walking. We must go in the carriage, to be sure."

<p/>"The carriage! But James will not like to put the horses to for such a little way;—and where are the poor horses to be while we are paying our visit?"

<p/>"They are to be put into Mr. Weston's stable, papa. You know we have settled all that already. We talked it all over with Mr. Weston last night. And as for James, you may be very sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will always like going to Randalls, because of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter's being housemaid there. I only doubt whether he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will ever take us anywhere else. That was your doing, papa. You got Hannah that good place. Nobody thought of Hannah till you mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>)—James is so obliged to you!"

<p/>"I am very glad I did think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). It was very lucky, for I would not have had poor James think himself slighted upon any account; and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will make a very good servant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) is a civil, pretty-spoken girl; I have a great opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>). Whenever I see her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always curtseys and asks me how I do, in a very pretty manner; and when you have had her (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) here to do needlework, I observe she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) always turns the lock of the door the right way and never bangs it. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Hannah</b></font>) will be an excellent servant; and it will be a great comfort to poor Miss Taylor to have somebody about her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is used to see. Whenever James goes over to see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter, you know, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be hearing of us. He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will be able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) how we all are."

<p/>Emma spared no exertions to maintain this happier flow of ideas, and hoped, by the help of backgammon, to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father tolerably through the evening, and be attacked by no regrets but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own. The backgammon-table was placed; but a visitor immediately afterwards walked in and made it unnecessary.

<p/>Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not only a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly connected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) lived about a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome, and at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their mutual connexions in London. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had returned to a late dinner, after some days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were well in Brunswick Square. It was a happy circumstance, and animated Mr. Woodhouse for some time. Mr. Knightley had a cheerful manner, which always did him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) many inquiries after <div class="bookquote">"poor Isabella"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) children were answered most satisfactorily. When this was over, Mr. Woodhouse gratefully observed, "It is very kind of you, Mr. Knightley, to come out at this late hour to call upon us. I am afraid you must have had a shocking walk."

<p/>"Not at all, sir. It is a beautiful moonlight night; and so mild that I must draw back from your great fire."

<p/>"But you must have found it very damp and dirty. I wish you may not catch cold."

<p/>"Dirty, sir! Look at my shoes. Not a speck on them."

<p/>"Well! that is quite surprising, for we have had a vast deal of rain here. It rained dreadfully hard for half an hour while we were at breakfast. I wanted them to put off the wedding."

<p/>"By the bye—I have not wished you joy. Being pretty well aware of what sort of joy you must both be feeling, I have been in no hurry with my congratulations; but I hope it all went off tolerably well. How did you all behave? Who cried most?"

<p/>"Ah! poor Miss Taylor! 'Tis a sad business."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor Mr. and Miss Woodhouse, if you please; but I cannot possibly say ' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Taylor</b></font>)</div>poor Miss Taylor.' I have a great regard for you and Emma; but when it comes to the question of dependence or independence!—At any rate, it must be better to have only one to please than two."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Especially when one of those two is such a fanciful, troublesome creature!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma playfully. "That is what you have in your head, I know—and what you would certainly say if my father were not by."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I believe it is very true, my dear, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, with a sigh. "I am afraid I am sometimes very fanciful and troublesome."

<p/>"My dearest papa! You do not think I could mean you, or suppose Mr. Knightley to mean you. What a horrible idea! Oh no! I meant only myself. Mr. Knightley loves to find fault with me, you know—in a joke—it is all a joke. We always say what we like to one another.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Knightley, in fact, was one of the few people who could see faults in Emma Woodhouse, and the only one who ever told her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) of them: and though this was not particularly agreeable to Emma herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew it would be so much less so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) really suspect such a circumstance as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not being thought perfect by every body.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Emma knows I never flatter her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)," said Mr. Knightley, "but I meant no reflection on any body. Miss Taylor has been used to have two persons to please; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will now have but one. The chances are that she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) must be a gainer."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, willing to let it pass—"you want to hear about the wedding; and I shall be happy to tell you, for we all behaved charmingly. Every body was punctual, every body in their best looks: not a tear, and hardly a long face to be seen. Oh no; we all felt that we were going to be only half a mile apart, and were sure of meeting every day."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Dear Emma bears every thing so well,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father. "But, Mr. Knightley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is really very sorry to lose poor Miss Taylor, and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) thinks for.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head, divided between tears and smiles. " (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>It is impossible that Emma should not miss such a companion," said Mr. Knightley. "We should not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so well as we do, sir, if we could suppose it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knows how much the marriage is to Miss Taylor's advantage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) knows how very acceptable it must be, at Miss Taylor's time of life, to be settled in a home of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own, and how important to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) to be secure of a comfortable provision, and therefore cannot allow herself to feel so much pain as pleasure. Every friend of Miss Taylor must be glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) so happily married."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And you have forgotten one matter of joy to me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma/Emma Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "and a very considerable one—that I made the match myself. I made the match, you know, four years ago; and to have it take place, and be proved in the right, when so many people said Mr. Weston would never marry again, may comfort me for any thing."

<p/>Mr. Knightley shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) head at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father fondly replied, "Ah! my dear, I wish you would not make matches and foretell things, for whatever you say always comes to pass. Pray do not make any more matches."

<p/>"I promise you to make none for myself, papa; but I must, indeed, for other people. It is the greatest amusement in the world! And after such success, you know!—Every body said that Mr. Weston would never marry again. Oh dear, no! Mr. Weston, who had been a widower so long, and who seemed so perfectly comfortable without a wife, so constantly occupied either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) business in town or among his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) friends here, always acceptable wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) went, always cheerful—Mr. Weston need not spend a single evening in the year alone if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not like it. Oh no! Mr. Weston certainly would never marry again. Some people even talked of a promise to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) deathbed, and others of the son and the uncle not letting him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). All manner of solemn nonsense was talked on the subject, but I believed none of it.

<p/>"Ever since the day—about four years ago—that Miss Taylor and I met with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in Broadway Lane, when, because it began to drizzle, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) darted away with so much gallantry, and borrowed two umbrellas for us from Farmer Mitchell's, I made up my mind on the subject. I planned the match from that hour; and when such success has blessed me in this instance, dear papa, you cannot think that I shall leave off match-making."

<p/>"I do not understand what you mean by <div class="bookquote">'success,' (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>" said Mr. Knightley. "Success supposes endeavour. Your time has been properly and delicately spent, if you have been endeavouring for the last four years to bring about this marriage. A worthy employment for a young lady's mind! But if, which I rather imagine, your making the match, as you call it, means only your planning it, your saying to yourself one idle day, 'I think it would be a very good thing for Miss Taylor if Mr. Weston were to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>),' and saying it again to yourself every now and then afterwards, why do you talk of success? Where is your merit? What are you proud of? You made a lucky guess; and that is all that can be said."

<p/>"And have you never known the pleasure and triumph of a lucky guess?—I pity you.—I thought you cleverer—for, depend upon it a lucky guess is never merely luck. There is always some talent in it. And as to my poor word <div class="bookquote">'success,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>which you quarrel with, I do not know that I am so entirely without any claim to it. You have drawn two pretty pictures; but I think there may be a third—a something between the do-nothing and the do-all. If I had not promoted Mr. Weston's visits here, and given many little encouragements, and smoothed many little matters, it might not have come to any thing after all. I think you must know Hartfield enough to comprehend that."

<p/>"A straightforward, open-hearted man like Weston, and a rational, unaffected woman like Miss Taylor, may be safely left to manage their own concerns. You are more likely to have done harm to yourself, than good to them, by interference."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Emma never thinks of herself, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) can do good to others,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>rejoined Mr. Woodhouse, understanding but in part. "But, my dear, pray do not make any more matches; they are silly things, and break up one's family circle grievously."

<p/>"Only one more, papa; only for Mr. Elton. Poor Mr. Elton! You like Mr. Elton, papa,—I must look about for a wife for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). There is nobody in Highbury who deserves him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)—and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has been here a whole year, and has fitted up his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) house so comfortably, that it would be a shame to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) single any longer—and I thought when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was joining their hands to-day, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) looked so very much as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would like to have the same kind office done for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)! I think very well of Mr. Elton, and this is the only way I have of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a service.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton is a very pretty young man, to be sure, and a very good young man, and I have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But if you want to shew him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) any attention, my dear, ask him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to come and dine with us some day. That will be a much better thing. I dare say Mr. Knightley will be so kind as to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"With a great deal of pleasure, sir, at any time,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, laughing, "and I agree with you entirely, that it will be a much better thing. Invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to dinner, Emma, and help him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to the best of the fish and the chicken, but leave him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to chuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own wife. Depend upon it, a man of six or seven-and-twenty can take care of himself."
