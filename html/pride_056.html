<p/>One morning, about a week after Bingley’s engagement with Jane
had been formed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and the females of the family were sitting
together in the dining-room, their attention was suddenly drawn
to the window, by the sound of a carriage; and they perceived a
chaise and four driving up the lawn. It was too early in the
morning for visitors, and besides, the equipage did not answer to
that of any of their neighbours. The horses were post; and
neither the carriage, nor the livery of the servant who preceded
it, were familiar to them. As it was certain, however, that
somebody was coming, Bingley instantly prevailed on Miss Bennet
to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion, and walk away with
him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) into the shrubbery. They both set off, and the conjectures of
the remaining three continued, though with little satisfaction,
till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered. It was
Lady Catherine de Bourgh.

<p/>They were of course all intending to be surprised; but their
astonishment was beyond their expectation; and on the part of
Mrs. Bennet and Kitty, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was perfectly unknown to them,
even inferior to what Elizabeth felt.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious,
made no other reply to Elizabeth’s salutation than a slight
inclination of the head, and sat down without saying a word.
Elizabeth had mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) name to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship’s
entrance, though no request of introduction had been made.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, all amazement, though flattered by having a guest of
such high importance, received her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) with the utmost politeness.
After sitting for a moment in silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said very stiffly to
Elizabeth,

<p/>"I hope you are well, Miss Bennet. That lady, I suppose, is your
mother.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth replied very concisely that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And _that_ I suppose is one of your sisters."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, delighted to speak to Lady
Catherine. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is my youngest girl but one. My youngest of all
is lately married, and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds,
walking with a young man who, I believe, will soon become a part
of the family."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have a very small park here,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine</b></font>)</div>returned Lady Catherine after
a short silence.

<p/>"It is nothing in comparison of Rosings, my lady, I dare say; but
I assure you it is much larger than Sir William Lucas’s."

<p/>"This must be a most inconvenient sitting room for the evening,
in summer; the windows are full west."

<p/>Mrs. Bennet assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) that they never sat there after dinner,
and then added:

<p/>"May I take the liberty of asking your ladyship whether you left
Mr. and Mrs. Collins well."

<p/>"Yes, very well. I saw them the night before last."

<p/>Elizabeth now expected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would produce a letter for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
from Charlotte, as it seemed the only probable motive for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
calling. But no letter appeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was completely puzzled.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, with great civility, begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship to take
some refreshment; but Lady Catherine very resolutely, and not
very politely, declined eating anything; and then, rising up,
said to Elizabeth,

<p/>"Miss Bennet, there seemed to be a prettyish kind of a little
wilderness on one side of your lawn. I should be glad to take a
turn in it, if you will favour me with your company."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Go, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) mother, "and show her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship about the
different walks. I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be pleased with the hermitage."

<p/>Elizabeth obeyed, and running into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) parasol,
attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) noble guest downstairs. As they passed through the
hall, Lady Catherine opened the doors into the dining-parlour and
drawing-room, and pronouncing them, after a short survey, to be
decent looking rooms, walked on.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) carriage remained at the door, and Elizabeth saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
waiting-woman was in it. They proceeded in silence along the
gravel walk that led to the copse; Elizabeth was determined to
make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more
than usually insolent and disagreeable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How could I ever think her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nephew?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
looked in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face.

<p/>As soon as they entered the copse, Lady Catherine began in the
following manner:—

<p/>"You can be at no loss, Miss Bennet, to understand the reason of
my journey hither. Your own heart, your own conscience, must tell
you why I come.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth looked with unaffected astonishment.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Indeed, you are mistaken, Madam. I have not been at all able to
account for the honour of seeing you here."

<p/>"Miss Bennet,<div class="bookquote">" replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship, in an angry tone, " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div>you ought
to know, that I am not to be trifled with. But however insincere
_you_ may choose to be, you shall not find _me_ so. My character
has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness, and in
a cause of such moment as this, I shall certainly not depart from
it. A report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago. I
was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most
advantageously married, but that you, that Miss Elizabeth Bennet,
would, in all likelihood, be soon afterwards united to my nephew,
my own nephew, Mr. Darcy. Though I _know_ it must be a scandalous
falsehood, though I would not injure him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so much as to suppose
the truth of it possible, I instantly resolved on setting off for
this place, that I might make my sentiments known to you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you believed it impossible to be true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth,
colouring with astonishment and disdain, "I wonder you took the
trouble of coming so far. What could your ladyship propose by
it?"

<p/>"At once to insist upon having such a report universally
contradicted."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth coolly, "will be rather a confirmation of it; if,
indeed, such a report is in existence."

<p/>"If! Do you then pretend to be ignorant of it? Has it not been
industriously circulated by yourselves? Do you not know that such
a report is spread abroad?"

<p/>"I never heard that it was."

<p/>"And can you likewise declare, that there is no _foundation_ for
it?"

<p/>"I do not pretend to possess equal frankness with your ladyship.
_You_ may ask questions which _I_ shall not choose to answer."

<p/>"This is not to be borne. Miss Bennet, I insist on being
satisfied. Has he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), has my nephew, made you an offer of marriage?"

<p/>"Your ladyship has declared it to be impossible."

<p/>"It ought to be so; it must be so, while he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) retains the use of
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) reason. But _your_ arts and allurements may, in a moment of
infatuation, have made him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) forget what he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) owes to himself and to
all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) family. You may have drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in."

<p/>"If I have, I shall be the last person to confess it."

<p/>"Miss Bennet, do you know who I am? I have not been accustomed to
such language as this. I am almost the nearest relation he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has in
the world, and am entitled to know all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) dearest concerns."

<p/>"But you are not entitled to know _mine;_ nor will such behaviour
as this, ever induce me to be explicit."

<p/>"Let me be rightly understood. This match, to which you have the
presumption to aspire, can never take place. No, never. Mr. Darcy
is engaged to _my daughter_. Now what have you to say?"

<p/>"Only this; that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is so, you can have no reason to suppose
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will make an offer to me."

<p/>Lady Catherine hesitated for a moment, and then replied:

<p/>"The engagement between them is of a peculiar kind. From their
infancy, they have been intended for each other. It was the
favourite wish of _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ mother, as well as of hers. While in
their cradles, we planned the union: and now, at the moment when
the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their
marriage, to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth, of
no importance in the world, and wholly unallied to the family! Do
you pay no regard to the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friends? To his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) tacit
engagement with Miss de Bourgh? Are you lost to every feeling of
propriety and delicacy? Have you not heard me say that from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
earliest hours he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was destined for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin?"

<p/>"Yes, and I had heard it before. But what is that to me? If there
is no other objection to my marrying your nephew, I shall
certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) mother and aunt
wished him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to marry Miss de Bourgh. You both did as much as you
could in planning the marriage. Its completion depended on
others. If Mr. Darcy is neither by honour nor inclination
confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin, why is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to make another choice? And
if I am that choice, why may not I accept him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Because honour, decorum, prudence, nay, interest, forbid it.
Yes, Miss Bennet, interest; for do not expect to be noticed by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family or friends, if you wilfully act against the
inclinations of all. You will be censured, slighted, and
despised, by everyone connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Your alliance will be a
disgrace; your name will never even be mentioned by any of us."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"These are heavy misfortunes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth. "But the wife
of Mr. Darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness
necessarily attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) situation, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could, upon the
whole, have no cause to repine."

<p/>"Obstinate, headstrong girl! I am ashamed of you! Is this your
gratitude for my attentions to you last spring? Is nothing due to
me on that score? Let us sit down. You are to understand, Miss
Bennet, that I came here with the determined resolution of
carrying my purpose; nor will I be dissuaded from it. I have not
been used to submit to any person’s whims. I have not been in the
habit of brooking disappointment."

<p/>"_That_ will make your ladyship’s situation at present more
pitiable; but it will have no effect on _me_."

<p/>"I will not be interrupted. Hear me in silence. My daughter and
my nephew are formed for each other. They are descended, on the
maternal side, from the same noble line; and, on the father’s,
from respectable, honourable, and ancient—though
untitled—families. Their fortune on both sides is splendid. They
are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their
respective houses; and what is to divide them? The upstart
pretensions of a young woman without family, connections, or
fortune. Is this to be endured! But it must not, shall not be. If
you were sensible of your own good, you would not wish to quit
the sphere in which you have been brought up."

<p/>"In marrying your nephew, I should not consider myself as
quitting that sphere. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is a gentleman; I am a gentleman’s
daughter; so far we are equal."

<p/>"True. You _are_ a gentleman’s daughter. But who was your mother?
Who are your uncles and aunts? Do not imagine me ignorant of
their condition."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Whatever my connections may be,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "if your nephew
does not object to them, they can be nothing to _you_."

<p/>"Tell me once for all, are you engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)?"

<p/>Though Elizabeth would not, for the mere purpose of obliging Lady
Catherine, have answered this question, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not but say,
after a moment’s deliberation:

<p/>"I am not.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lady Catherine seemed pleased.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>And will you promise me, never to enter into such an
engagement?"

<p/>"I will make no promise of the kind."

<p/>"Miss Bennet I am shocked and astonished. I expected to find a
more reasonable young woman. But do not deceive yourself into a
belief that I will ever recede. I shall not go away till you have
given me the assurance I require."

<p/>"And I certainly _never_ shall give it. I am not to be
intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable. Your ladyship
wants Mr. Darcy to marry your daughter; but would my giving you
the wished-for promise make _their_ marriage at all more
probable? Supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be attached to me, would _my_ refusing
to accept his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) hand make him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wish to bestow it on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin?
Allow me to say, Lady Catherine, that the arguments with which
you have supported this extraordinary application have been as
frivolous as the application was ill-judged. You have widely
mistaken my character, if you think I can be worked on by such
persuasions as these. How far your nephew might approve of your
interference in _his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)_ affairs, I cannot tell; but you have
certainly no right to concern yourself in mine. I must beg,
therefore, to be importuned no farther on the subject."

<p/>"Not so hasty, if you please. I have by no means done. To all the
objections I have already urged, I have still another to add. I
am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sister’s
infamous elopement. I know it all; that the young man’s marrying
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was a patched-up business, at the expence of your father and
uncles. And is _such_ a girl to be my nephew’s sister? Is _her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)_
husband, who is the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) late father’s steward, to be his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
brother? Heaven and earth!—of what are you thinking? Are the
shades of Pemberley to be thus polluted?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You can _now_ have nothing further to say,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) resentfully
answered. "You have insulted me in every possible method. I must
beg to return to the house."

<p/>And she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) rose as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) spoke. Lady Catherine rose also, and they
turned back. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship was highly incensed.

<p/>"You have no regard, then, for the honour and credit of my
nephew! Unfeeling, selfish girl! Do you not consider that a
connection with you must disgrace him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in the eyes of everybody?"

<p/>"Lady Catherine, I have nothing further to say. You know my
sentiments."

<p/>"You are then resolved to have him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)?"

<p/>"I have said no such thing. I am only resolved to act in that
manner, which will, in my own opinion, constitute my happiness,
without reference to _you_, or to any person so wholly
unconnected with me."

<p/>"It is well. You refuse, then, to oblige me. You refuse to obey
the claims of duty, honour, and gratitude. You are determined to
ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in the opinion of all his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) friends, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) the
contempt of the world."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth,
"have any possible claim on me, in the present instance. No
principle of either would be violated by my marriage with Mr.
Darcy. And with regard to the resentment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family, or the
indignation of the world, if the former _were_ excited by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
marrying me, it would not give me one moment’s concern—and the
world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn."

<p/>"And this is your real opinion! This is your final resolve! Very
well. I shall now know how to act. Do not imagine, Miss Bennet,
that your ambition will ever be gratified. I came to try you. I
hoped to find you reasonable; but, depend upon it, I will carry
my point."

<p/>In this manner Lady Catherine talked on, till they were at the
door of the carriage, when, turning hastily round, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, "I
take no leave of you, Miss Bennet. I send no compliments to your
mother. You deserve no such attention. I am most seriously
displeased."

<p/>Elizabeth made no answer; and without attempting to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ladyship to return into the house, walked quietly into it
herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard the carriage drive away as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) proceeded up
stairs. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother impatiently met her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) at the door of the
dressing-room, to ask why Lady Catherine would not come in again
and rest herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not choose it,"  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would go."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is a very fine-looking woman! and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) calling here was
prodigiously civil! for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only came, I suppose, to tell us the
Collinses were well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) road somewhere, I dare say,
and so, passing through Meryton, thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might as well call
on you. I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had nothing particular to say to you,
Lizzy?"

<p/>Elizabeth was forced to give into a little falsehood here; for to
acknowledge the substance of their conversation was impossible.
