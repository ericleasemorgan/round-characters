<p/>Some change of countenance was necessary for each gentleman as they walked into Mrs. Weston's drawing-room; Mr. Elton must compose his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joyous looks, and Mr. John Knightley disperse his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour. Mr. Elton must smile less, and Mr. John Knightley more, to fit them for the place. Emma only might be as nature prompted, and shew herself just as happy as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) it was real enjoyment to be with the Westons. Mr. Weston was a great favourite, and there was not a creature in the world to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke with such unreserve, as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; not any one, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) related with such conviction of being listened to and understood, of being always interesting and always intelligible, the little affairs, arrangements, perplexities, and pleasures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father and herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could tell nothing of Hartfield, in which Mrs. Weston had not a lively concern; and half an hour's uninterrupted communication of all those little matters on which the daily happiness of private life depends, was one of the first gratifications of each.

<p/>This was a pleasure which perhaps the whole day's visit might not afford, which certainly did not belong to the present half-hour; but the very sight of Mrs. Weston, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) touch, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice was grateful to Emma, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) determined to think as little as possible of Mr. Elton's oddities, or of any thing else unpleasant, and enjoy all that was enjoyable to the utmost.

<p/>The misfortune of Harriet's cold had been pretty well gone through before her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) arrival. Mr. Woodhouse had been safely seated long enough to give the history of it, besides all the history of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own and Isabella's coming, and of Emma's being to follow, and had indeed just got to the end of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) satisfaction that James should come and see his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) daughter, when the others appeared, and Mrs. Weston, who had been almost wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) attentions to him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), was able to turn away and welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dear Emma.

<p/>Emma's project of forgetting Mr. Elton for a while made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) rather sorry to find, when they had all taken their places, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The difficulty was great of driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strange insensibility towards Harriet, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not only sat at her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) elbow, but was continually obtruding his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy countenance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) notice, and solicitously addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) upon every occasion. Instead of forgetting him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) behaviour was such that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not avoid the internal suggestion of "Can it really be as my brother imagined? can it be possible for this man to be beginning to transfer his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections from Harriet to me? Absurd and insufferable!" Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would be so anxious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being perfectly warm, would be so interested about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, and so delighted with Mrs. Weston; and at last would begin admiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) drawings with so much zeal and so little knowledge as seemed terribly like a would-be lover, and made it some effort with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good manners. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own sake she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be rude; and for Harriet's, in the hope that all would yet turn out right, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was even positively civil; but it was an effort; especially as something was going on amongst the others, in the most overpowering period of Mr. Elton's nonsense, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) particularly wished to listen to. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard enough to know that Mr. Weston was giving some information about his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard the words <div class="bookquote">"my son,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"Frank,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"my son,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>repeated several times over; and, from a few other half-syllables very much suspected that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was announcing an early visit from his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) son; but before she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could quiet Mr. Elton, the subject was so completely past that any reviving question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would have been awkward.

<p/>Now, it so happened that in spite of Emma's resolution of never marrying, there was something in the name, in the idea of Mr. Frank Churchill, which always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had frequently thought especially since his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage with Miss Taylor that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) were to marry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was the very person to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) in age, character and condition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed by this connexion between the families, quite to belong to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) could not but suppose it to be a match that every body who knew them must think of. That Mr. and Mrs. Weston did think of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was very strongly persuaded; and though not meaning to be induced by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), or by any body else, to give up a situation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed more replete with good than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could change it for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a great curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), a decided intention of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pleasant, of being liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to a certain degree, and a sort of pleasure in the idea of their being coupled in their friends' imaginations.

<p/>With such sensations, Mr. Elton's civilities were dreadfully ill-timed; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had the comfort of appearing very polite, while feeling very cross and of thinking that the rest of the visit could not possibly pass without bringing forward the same information again, or the substance of it, from the open-hearted Mr. Weston. So it proved; for when happily released from Mr. Elton, and seated by Mr. Weston, at dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) made use of the very first interval in the cares of hospitality, the very first leisure from the saddle of mutton, to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>),

<p/>"We want only two more to be just the right number. I should like to see two more here, your pretty little friend, Miss Smith, and my son and then I should say we were quite complete. I believe you did not hear me telling the others in the drawing-room that we are expecting Frank. I had a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) this morning, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will be with us within a fortnight.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma spoke with a very proper degree of pleasure; and fully assented to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) proposition of Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Smith making their party quite complete.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has been wanting to come to us," continued Mr. Weston, "ever since September: every letter has been full of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cannot command his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has those to please who must be pleased, and who (between ourselves) are sometimes to be pleased only by a good many sacrifices. But now I have no doubt of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) here about the second week in January."

<p/>"What a very great pleasure it will be to you! and Mrs. Weston is so anxious to be acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be almost as happy as yourself."

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be, but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks there will be another put-off. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) coming so much as I do: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not know the parties so well as I do. The case, you see, is (but this is quite between ourselves: I did not mention a syllable of it in the other room. There are secrets in all families, you know) The case is, that a party of friends are invited to pay a visit at Enscombe in January; and that Frank's coming depends upon their being put off. If they are not put off, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) cannot stir. But I know they will, because it is a family that a certain lady, of some consequence, at Enscombe, has a particular dislike to: and though it is thought necessary to invite them once in two or three years, they always are put off when it comes to the point. I have not the smallest doubt of the issue. I am as confident of seeing Frank here before the middle of January, as I am of being here myself: but your good friend there (nodding towards the upper end of the table) has so few vagaries herself, and has been so little used to them at Hartfield, that she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) cannot calculate on their effects, as I have been long in the practice of doing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sorry there should be any thing like doubt in the case,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; "but am disposed to side with you, Mr. Weston. If you think he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will come, I shall think so too; for you know Enscombe."

<p/>"Yes I have some right to that knowledge; though I have never been at the place in my life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is an odd woman! But I never allow myself to speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), on Frank's account; for I do believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be very fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). I used to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not capable of being fond of any body, except herself: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has always been kind to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) (in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way allowing for little whims and caprices, and expecting every thing to be as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) likes). And it is no small credit, in my opinion, to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should excite such an affection; for, though I would not say it to any body else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has no more heart than a stone to people in general; and the devil of a temper."

<p/>Emma liked the subject so well, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began upon it, to Mrs. Weston, very soon after their moving into the drawing-room: wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) joy yet observing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the first meeting must be rather alarming.  Mrs. Weston agreed to it; but added, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should be very glad to be secure of undergoing the anxiety of a first meeting at the time talked of: "for I cannot depend upon his (<font color='blue'><b>devil</b></font>) coming. I cannot be so sanguine as Mr. Weston. I am very much afraid that it will all end in nothing. Mr. Weston, I dare say, has been telling you exactly how the matter stands?"

<p/>"Yes it seems to depend upon nothing but the ill-humour of Mrs. Churchill, which I imagine to be the most certain thing in the world."

<p/>"My Emma!" replied Mrs. Weston, smiling, "what is the certainty of caprice?" Then turning to Isabella, who had not been attending before "You must know, my dear Mrs. Knightley, that we are by no means so sure of seeing Mr. Frank Churchill, in my opinion, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father thinks. It depends entirely upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt's spirits and pleasure; in short, upon her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) temper. To you to my two daughters I may venture on the truth. Mrs. Churchill rules at Enscombe, and is a very odd-tempered woman; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming now, depends upon her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) being willing to spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, Mrs. Churchill; every body knows Mrs. Churchill,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>replied Isabella: "and I am sure I never think of that poor young man without the greatest compassion. To be constantly living with an ill-tempered person, must be dreadful. It is what we happily have never known any thing of; but it must be a life of misery. What a blessing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) never had any children! Poor little creatures, how unhappy she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would have made them!"

<p/>Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been alone with Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should then have heard more: Mrs. Weston would speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), with a degree of unreserve which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would not hazard with Isabella; and, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) really believed, would scarcely try to conceal any thing relative to the Churchills from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), excepting those views on the young man, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own imagination had already given her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) such instinctive knowledge. But at present there was nothing more to be said. Mr. Woodhouse very soon followed them into the drawing-room. To be sitting long after dinner, was a confinement that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not endure. Neither wine nor conversation was any thing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); and gladly did he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) move to those with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was always comfortable.

<p/>While he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) talked to Isabella, however, Emma found an opportunity of saying,

<p/>"And so you do not consider this visit from your son as by any means certain. I am sorry for it. The introduction must be unpleasant, whenever it takes place; and the sooner it could be over, the better."

<p/>"Yes; and every delay makes one more apprehensive of other delays. Even if this family, the Braithwaites, are put off, I am still afraid that some excuse may be found for disappointing us. I cannot bear to imagine any reluctance on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) side; but I am sure there is a great wish on the Churchills' to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) to themselves. There is jealousy. They are jealous even of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) father. In short, I can feel no dependence on his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) coming, and I wish Mr. Weston were less sanguine."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. "If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could stay only a couple of days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to come; and one can hardly conceive a young man's not having it in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power to do as much as that. A young woman, if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) fall into bad hands, may be teased, and kept at a distance from those she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wants to be with; but one cannot comprehend a young man's being under such restraint, as not to be able to spend a week with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likes it."

<p/>"One ought to be at Enscombe, and know the ways of the family, before one decides upon what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can do,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mrs. Weston. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>One ought to use the same caution, perhaps, in judging of the conduct of any one individual of any one family; but Enscombe, I believe, certainly must not be judged by general rules: she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is so very unreasonable; and every thing gives way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is so fond of the nephew: he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is so very great a favourite. Now, according to my idea of Mrs. Churchill, it would be most natural, that while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) makes no sacrifice for the comfort of the husband, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owes every thing, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) exercises incessant caprice towards him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should frequently be governed by the nephew, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owes nothing at all."

<p/>"My dearest Emma, do not pretend, with your sweet temper, to understand a bad one, or to lay down rules for it: you must let it go its own way. I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) having, at times, considerable influence; but it may be perfectly impossible for him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) to know beforehand when it will be."

<p/>Emma listened, and then coolly said, "I shall not be satisfied, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) comes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) may have a great deal of influence on some points,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Weston, "and on others, very little: and among those, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) reach, it is but too likely, may be this very circumstance of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) coming away from them to visit us."
