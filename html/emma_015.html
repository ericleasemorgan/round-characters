<p/>Mr. Woodhouse was soon ready for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tea; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had drank his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tea he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was quite ready to go home; and it was as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) three companions could do, to entertain away his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) notice of the lateness of the hour, before the other gentlemen appeared. Mr. Weston was chatty and convivial, and no friend to early separations of any sort; but at last the drawing-room party did receive an augmentation. Mr. Elton, in very good spirits, was one of the first to walk in. Mrs. Weston and Emma were sitting together on a sofa. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joined them immediately, and, with scarcely an invitation, seated himself between them.

<p/>Emma, in good spirits too, from the amusement afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind by the expectation of Mr. Frank Churchill, was willing to forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) late improprieties, and be as well satisfied with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) as before, and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) making Harriet his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) very first subject, was ready to listen with most friendly smiles.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) professed himself extremely anxious about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair friend her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fair, lovely, amiable friend. "Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) know? had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard any thing about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), since their being at Randalls? he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) felt much anxiety he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must confess that the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) complaint alarmed him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) considerably.<div class="bookquote">" And in this style he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) talked on for some time very properly, not much attending to any answer, but altogether sufficiently awake to the terror of a bad sore throat; and Emma was quite in charity with him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).

<p/>But at last there seemed a perverse turn; it seemed all at once as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) were more afraid of its being a bad sore throat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) account, than on Harriet's more anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should escape the infection, than that there should be no infection in the complaint. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) began with great earnestness to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to refrain from visiting the sick-chamber again, for the present to entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to promise him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) not to venture into such hazard till he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had seen Mr. Perry and learnt his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) opinion; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to laugh it off and bring the subject back into its proper course, there was no putting an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) extreme solicitude about her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was vexed. It did appear there was no concealing it exactly like the pretence of being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), instead of Harriet; an inconstancy, if real, the most contemptible and abominable! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had difficulty in behaving with temper. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) turned to Mrs. Weston to implore her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) assistance, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) support? would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) add her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) persuasions to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), to induce Miss Woodhouse not to go to Mrs. Goddard's till it were certain that Miss Smith's disorder had no infection? He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could not be satisfied without a promise would not she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) give him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) influence in procuring it?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So scrupulous for others,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) continued, "and yet so careless for herself! She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) wanted me to nurse my cold by staying at home to-day, and yet will not promise to avoid the danger of catching an ulcerated sore throat herself. Is this fair, Mrs. Weston? Judge between us. Have not I some right to complain? I am sure of your kind support and aid."

<p/>Emma saw Mrs. Weston's surprize, and felt that it must be great, at an address which, in words and manner, was assuming to himself the right of first interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and as for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much provoked and offended to have the power of directly saying any thing to the purpose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could only give him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) a look; but it was such a look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought must restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Judge</b></font>) senses, and then left the sofa, removing to a seat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not time to know how Mr. Elton took the reproof, so rapidly did another subject succeed; for Mr. John Knightley now came into the room from examining the weather, and opened on them all with the information of the ground being covered with snow, and of its still snowing fast, with a strong drifting wind; concluding with these words to Mr. Woodhouse:

<p/>"This will prove a spirited beginning of your winter engagements, sir. Something new for your coachman and horses to be making their way through a storm of snow."

<p/>Poor Mr. Woodhouse was silent from consternation; but every body else had something to say; every body was either surprized or not surprized, and had some question to ask, or some comfort to offer. Mrs. Weston and Emma tried earnestly to cheer him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) and turn his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) attention from his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son-in-law, who was pursuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) triumph rather unfeelingly.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I admired your resolution very much, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), "in venturing out in such weather, for of course you saw there would be snow very soon. Every body must have seen the snow coming on. I admired your spirit; and I dare say we shall get home very well. Another hour or two's snow can hardly make the road impassable; and we are two carriages; if one is blown over in the bleak part of the common field there will be the other at hand. I dare say we shall be all safe at Hartfield before midnight."

<p/>Mr. Weston, with triumph of a different sort, was confessing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had known it to be snowing some time, but had not said a word, lest it should make Mr. Woodhouse uncomfortable, and be an excuse for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) hurrying away. As to there being any quantity of snow fallen or likely to fall to impede their return, that was a mere joke; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was afraid they would find no difficulty. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wished the road might be impassable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) might be able to keep them all at Randalls; and with the utmost good-will was sure that accommodation might be found for every body, calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) wife to agree with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that with a little contrivance, every body might be lodged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) hardly knew how to do, from the consciousness of there being but two spare rooms in the house.

<p/>"What is to be done, my dear Emma? what is to be done?" was Mr. Woodhouse's first exclamation, and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could say for some time. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) looked for comfort; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assurances of safety, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) representation of the excellence of the horses, and of James, and of their having so many friends about them, revived him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) a little.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) eldest daughter's alarm was equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) own. The horror of being blocked up at Randalls, while her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children were at Hartfield, was full in her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) imagination; and fancying the road to be now just passable for adventurous people, but in a state that admitted no delay, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was eager to have it settled, that her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father and Emma should remain at Randalls, while she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) husband set forward instantly through all the possible accumulations of drifted snow that might impede them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You had better order the carriage directly, my love,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); "I dare say we shall be able to get along, if we set off directly; and if we do come to any thing very bad, I can get out and walk. I am not at all afraid. I should not mind walking half the way. I could change my shoes, you know, the moment I got home; and it is not the sort of thing that gives me cold."

<p/>"Indeed!<div class="bookquote">" replied he (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>Then, my dear Isabella, it is the most extraordinary sort of thing in the world, for in general every thing does give you cold. Walk home! you are prettily shod for walking home, I dare say. It will be bad enough for the horses."

<p/>Isabella turned to Mrs. Weston for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) approbation of the plan. Mrs. Weston could only approve. Isabella then went to Emma; but Emma could not so entirely give up the hope of their being all able to get away; and they were still discussing the point, when Mr. Knightley, who had left the room immediately after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother's first report of the snow, came back again, and told them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been out of doors to examine, and could answer for there not being the smallest difficulty in their getting home, whenever they liked it, either now or an hour hence. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had gone beyond the sweep some way along the Highbury road the snow was nowhere above half an inch deep in many places hardly enough to whiten the ground; a very few flakes were falling at present, but the clouds were parting, and there was every appearance of its being soon over. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen the coachmen, and they both agreed with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in there being nothing to apprehend.

<p/>To Isabella, the relief of such tidings was very great, and they were scarcely less acceptable to Emma on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's account, who was immediately set as much at ease on the subject as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) nervous constitution allowed; but the alarm that had been raised could not be appeased so as to admit of any comfort for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) while he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued at Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was satisfied of there being no present danger in returning home, but no assurances could convince him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that it was safe to stay; and while the others were variously urging and recommending, Mr. Knightley and Emma settled it in a few brief sentences: thus

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your father will not be easy; why do not you go?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I am ready, if the others are."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Shall I ring the bell?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, do."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And the bell was rung, and the carriages spoken for. A few minutes more, and Emma hoped to see one troublesome companion deposited in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) own house, to get sober and cool, and the other recover his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) temper and happiness when this visit of hardship were over.

<p/>The carriage came: and Mr. Woodhouse, always the first object on such occasions, was carefully attended to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own by Mr. Knightley and Mr. Weston; but not all that either could say could prevent some renewal of alarm at the sight of the snow which had actually fallen, and the discovery of a much darker night than he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been prepared for. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was afraid they should have a very bad drive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was afraid poor Isabella would not like it. And there would be poor Emma in the carriage behind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not know what they had best do. They must keep as much together as they could;"  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>and James was talked to, and given a charge to go very slow and wait for the other carriage.

<p/>Isabella stept in after her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father; John Knightley, forgetting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not belong to their party, stept in after his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wife very naturally; so that Emma found, on being escorted and followed into the second carriage by Mr. Elton, that the door was to be lawfully shut on them, and that they were to have a t te- -t te drive. It would not have been the awkwardness of a moment, it would have been rather a pleasure, previous to the suspicions of this very day; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have talked to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) of Harriet, and the three-quarters of a mile would have seemed but one. But now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather it had not happened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been drinking too much of Mr. Weston's good wine, and felt sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would want to be talking nonsense.

<p/>To restrain him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as much as might be, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was immediately preparing to speak with exquisite calmness and gravity of the weather and the night; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) begun, scarcely had they passed the sweep-gate and joined the other carriage, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) subject cut up her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand seized her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention demanded, and Mr. Elton actually making violent love to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>): availing himself of the precious opportunity, declaring sentiments which must be already well known, hoping fearing adoring ready to die if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but flattering himself that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) ardent attachment and unequalled love and unexampled passion could not fail of having some effect, and in short, very much resolved on being seriously accepted as soon as possible. It really was so. Without scruple without apology without much apparent diffidence, Mr. Elton, the lover of Harriet, was professing himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) lover. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) tried to stop him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); but vainly; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would go on, and say it all. Angry as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, the thought of the moment made her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolve to restrain herself when she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) felt that half this folly must be drunkenness, and therefore could hope that it might belong only to the passing hour. Accordingly, with a mixture of the serious and the playful, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped would best suit his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) half and half state, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) replied,

<p/>"I am very much astonished, Mr. Elton. This to me! you forget yourself you take me for my friend any message to Miss Smith I shall be happy to deliver; but no more of this to me, if you please."

<p/>"Miss Smith! message to Miss Smith! What could she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) possibly mean!<div class="bookquote">" And he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) repeated her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) words with such assurance of accent, such boastful pretence of amazement, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not help replying with quickness,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton, this is the most extraordinary conduct! and I can account for it only in one way; you are not yourself, or you could not speak either to me, or of Harriet, in such a manner. Command yourself enough to say no more, and I will endeavour to forget it."

<p/>But Mr. Elton had only drunk wine enough to elevate his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spirits, not at all to confuse his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) intellects. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) perfectly knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own meaning; and having warmly protested against her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) suspicion as most injurious, and slightly touched upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) respect for Miss Smith as her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friend, but acknowledging his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wonder that Miss Smith should be mentioned at all, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) resumed the subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own passion, and was very urgent for a favourable answer.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought less of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) inebriety, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thought more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) inconstancy and presumption; and with fewer struggles for politeness, replied,

<p/>"It is impossible for me to doubt any longer. You have made yourself too clear. Mr. Elton, my astonishment is much beyond any thing I can express. After such behaviour, as I have witnessed during the last month, to Miss Smith such attentions as I have been in the daily habit of observing to be addressing me in this manner this is an unsteadiness of character, indeed, which I had not supposed possible! Believe me, sir, I am far, very far, from gratified in being the object of such professions."

<p/>"Good Heaven!" cried Mr. Elton, "what can be the meaning of this? Miss Smith! I never thought of Miss Smith in the whole course of my existence never paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) any attentions, but as your friend: never cared whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) were dead or alive, but as your friend. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) has fancied otherwise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own wishes have misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and I am very sorry extremely sorry But, Miss Smith, indeed! Oh! Miss Woodhouse! who can think of Miss Smith, when Miss Woodhouse is near! No, upon my honour, there is no unsteadiness of character. I have thought only of you. I protest against having paid the smallest attention to any one else. Every thing that I have said or done, for many weeks past, has been with the sole view of marking my adoration of yourself. You cannot really, seriously, doubt it. No! (in an accent meant to be insinuating) I am sure you have seen and understood me."

<p/>It would be impossible to say what Emma felt, on hearing this which of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unpleasant sensations was uppermost. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too completely overpowered to be immediately able to reply: and two moments of silence being ample encouragement for Mr. Elton's sanguine state of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) tried to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand again, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) joyously exclaimed

<p/>"Charming Miss Woodhouse! allow me to interpret this interesting silence. It confesses that you have long understood me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, "it confesses no such thing. So far from having long understood you, I have been in a most complete error with respect to your views, till this moment. As to myself, I am very sorry that you should have been giving way to any feelings Nothing could be farther from my wishes your attachment to my friend Harriet your pursuit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), (pursuit, it appeared,) gave me great pleasure, and I have been very earnestly wishing you success: but had I supposed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were not your attraction to Hartfield, I should certainly have thought you judged ill in making your visits so frequent. Am I to believe that you have never sought to recommend yourself particularly to Miss Smith? that you have never thought seriously of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Never, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>cried he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), affronted in his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) turn: "never, I assure you. I think seriously of Miss Smith! Miss Smith is a very good sort of girl; and I should be happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) respectably settled. I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) extremely well: and, no doubt, there are men who might not object to Every body has their level: but as for myself, I am not, I think, quite so much at a loss. I need not so totally despair of an equal alliance, as to be addressing myself to Miss Smith! No, madam, my visits to Hartfield have been for yourself only; and the encouragement I received "

<p/>"Encouragement! I give you encouragement! Sir, you have been entirely mistaken in supposing it. I have seen you only as the admirer of my friend. In no other light could you have been more to me than a common acquaintance. I am exceedingly sorry: but it is well that the mistake ends where it does. Had the same behaviour continued, Miss Smith might have been led into a misconception of your views; not being aware, probably, any more than myself, of the very great inequality which you are so sensible of. But, as it is, the disappointment is single, and, I trust, will not be lasting. I have no thoughts of matrimony at present."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was too angry to say another word; her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) manner too decided to invite supplication; and in this state of swelling resentment, and mutually deep mortification, they had to continue together a few minutes longer, for the fears of Mr. Woodhouse had confined them to a foot-pace. If there had not been so much anger, there would have been desperate awkwardness; but their straightforward emotions left no room for the little zigzags of embarrassment. Without knowing when the carriage turned into Vicarage Lane, or when it stopped, they found themselves, all at once, at the door of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) house; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was out before another syllable passed. Emma then felt it indispensable to wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) a good night. The compliment was just returned, coldly and proudly; and, under indescribable irritation of spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was then conveyed to Hartfield.

<p/>There she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) was welcomed, with the utmost delight, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, who had been trembling for the dangers of a solitary drive from Vicarage Lane turning a corner which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could never bear to think of and in strange hands a mere common coachman no James; and there it seemed as if her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) return only were wanted to make every thing go well: for Mr. John Knightley, ashamed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill-humour, was now all kindness and attention; and so particularly solicitous for the comfort of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, as to seem if not quite ready to join him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in a basin of gruel perfectly sensible of its being exceedingly wholesome; and the day was concluding in peace and comfort to all their little party, except herself. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind had never been in such perturbation; and it needed a very strong effort to appear attentive and cheerful till the usual hour of separating allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) the relief of quiet reflection.
