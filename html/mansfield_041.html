<p/>A week was gone since Edmund might be supposed in town, and Fanny had
heard nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). There were three different conclusions to be
drawn from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) silence, between which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind was in fluctuation; each
of them at times being held the most probable. Either his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) going had
been again delayed, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had yet procured no opportunity of seeing
Miss Crawford alone, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was too happy for letter-writing!

<p/>One morning, about this time, Fanny having now been nearly four weeks
from Mansfield, a point which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never failed to think over and
calculate every day, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and Susan were preparing to remove, as
usual, upstairs, they were stopped by the knock of a visitor, whom they
felt they could not avoid, from Rebecca’s alertness in going to the
door, a duty which always interested her (<font color='blue'><b>Rebecca</b></font>) beyond any other.

<p/>It was a gentleman’s voice; it was a voice that Fanny was just turning
pale about, when Mr. Crawford walked into the room.

<p/>Good sense, like hers, will always act when really called upon; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been able to name him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, and recall her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
remembrance of the name, as that of <div class="bookquote">"William’s friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could not previously have believed herself capable of uttering a
syllable at such a moment. The consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) being known there
only as William’s friend was some support. Having introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>),
however, and being all reseated, the terrors that occurred of what this
visit might lead to were overpowering, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fancied herself on the
point of fainting away.

<p/>While trying to keep herself alive, their visitor, who had at first
approached her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with as animated a countenance as ever, was wisely and
kindly keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) eyes away, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time to recover, while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
devoted himself entirely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother, addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and attending
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with the utmost politeness and propriety, at the same time with
a degree of friendliness, of interest at least, which was making his (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
manner perfect.

<p/>Mrs. Price’s manners were also at their best. Warmed by the sight of
such a friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) son, and regulated by the wish of appearing to
advantage before him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was overflowing with gratitude—artless,
maternal gratitude—which could not be unpleasing. Mr. Price was out,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) regretted very much. Fanny was just recovered enough to feel
that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ could not regret it; for to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) many other sources of
uneasiness was added the severe one of shame for the home in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
found her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might scold herself for the weakness, but there was no
scolding it away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was ashamed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have been yet more
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father than of all the rest.

<p/>They talked of William, a subject on which Mrs. Price could never tire;
and Mr. Crawford was as warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) commendation as even her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) heart
could wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had never seen so agreeable a man in her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
life; and was only astonished to find that, so great and so agreeable
as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be come down to Portsmouth neither on a visit to
the port-admiral, nor the commissioner, nor yet with the intention of
going over to the island, nor of seeing the dockyard. Nothing of all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had been used to think of as the proof of importance, or the
employment of wealth, had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>commissioner</b></font>) to Portsmouth. He (<font color='blue'><b>commissioner</b></font>) had reached it
late the night before, was come for a day or two, was staying at the
Crown, had accidentally met with a navy officer or two of his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>)
acquaintance since his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) arrival, but had no object of that kind in
coming.

<p/>By the time he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had given all this information, it was not unreasonable
to suppose that Fanny might be looked at and spoken to; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
tolerably able to bear his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) eye, and hear that he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) had spent half an hour
with his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) sister the evening before his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) leaving London; that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had
sent her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) best and kindest love, but had had no time for writing; that
he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) thought himself lucky in seeing Mary for even half an hour, having
spent scarcely twenty-four hours in London, after his (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) return from
Norfolk, before he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>) set off again; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) cousin Edmund was in town,
had been in town, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) understood, a few days; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
himself, but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was well, had left them all well at Mansfield, and
was to dine, as yesterday, with the Frasers.

<p/>Fanny listened collectedly, even to the last-mentioned circumstance;
nay, it seemed a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) worn mind to be at any certainty; and
the words, "then by this time it is all settled," passed internally,
without more evidence of emotion than a faint blush.

<p/>After talking a little more about Mansfield, a subject in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
interest was most apparent, Crawford began to hint at the expediency of
an early walk. <div class="bookquote">"It was a lovely morning, and at that season of the year
a fine morning so often turned off, that it was wisest for everybody
not to delay their exercise" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>; and such hints producing nothing, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) soon
proceeded to a positive recommendation to Mrs. Price and her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughters
to take their walk without loss of time. Now they came to an
understanding. Mrs. Price, it appeared, scarcely ever stirred out of
doors, except of a Sunday; she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) owned she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) could seldom, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) large
family, find time for a walk. <div class="bookquote">"Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) not, then, persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
daughters to take advantage of such weather, and allow him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the pleasure
of attending them?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Price</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Price was greatly obliged and very complying.
<div class="bookquote">"Her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughters were very much confined; Portsmouth was a sad place;
they did not often get out; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) knew they had some errands in the
town, which they would be very glad to do."  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>And the consequence was,
that Fanny, strange as it was—strange, awkward, and distressing—found
herself and Susan, within ten minutes, walking towards the High Street
with Mr. Crawford.

<p/>It was soon pain upon pain, confusion upon confusion; for they were
hardly in the High Street before they met her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father, whose appearance
was not the better from its being Saturday. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) stopt; and,
ungentlemanlike as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looked, Fanny was obliged to introduce him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to Mr.
Crawford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not have a doubt of the manner in which Mr.
Crawford must be struck. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must be ashamed and disgusted altogether.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must soon give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) up, and cease to have the smallest inclination
for the match; and yet, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been so much wanting his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
affection to be cured, this was a sort of cure that would be almost as
bad as the complaint; and I believe there is scarcely a young lady in
the United Kingdoms who would not rather put up with the misfortune of
being sought by a clever, agreeable man, than have him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) driven away by
the vulgarity of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) nearest relations.

<p/>Mr. Crawford probably could not regard his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) future father-in-law with
any idea of taking him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for a model in dress; but (as Fanny instantly,
and to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great relief, discerned) her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father was a very different
man, a very different Mr. Price in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) behaviour to this most highly
respected stranger, from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) own family at home. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
manners now, though not polished, were more than passable: they were
grateful, animated, manly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) expressions were those of an attached
father, and a sensible man; his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loud tones did very well in the open
air, and there was not a single oath to be heard. Such was his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
instinctive compliment to the good manners of Mr. Crawford; and, be the
consequence what it might, Fanny’s immediate feelings were infinitely
soothed.

<p/>The conclusion of the two gentlemen’s civilities was an offer of Mr.
Price’s to take Mr. Crawford into the dockyard, which Mr. Crawford,
desirous of accepting as a favour what was intended as such, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had seen the dockyard again and again, and hoping to be so much the
longer with Fanny, was very gratefully disposed to avail himself of, if
the Miss Prices were not afraid of the fatigue; and as it was somehow
or other ascertained, or inferred, or at least acted upon, that they
were not at all afraid, to the dockyard they were all to go; and but
for Mr. Crawford, Mr. Price would have turned thither directly, without
the smallest consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughters’ errands in the High
Street. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) took care, however, that they should be allowed to go to the
shops they came out expressly to visit; and it did not delay them long,
for Fanny could so little bear to excite impatience, or be waited for,
that before the gentlemen, as they stood at the door, could do more
than begin upon the last naval regulations, or settle the number of
three-deckers now in commission, their companions were ready to
proceed.

<p/>They were then to set forward for the dockyard at once, and the walk
would have been conducted—according to Mr. Crawford’s opinion—in a
singular manner, had Mr. Price been allowed the entire regulation of
it, as the two girls, he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) found, would have been left to follow, and
keep up with them or not, as they could, while they walked on together
at their own hasty pace. He (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was able to introduce some improvement
occasionally, though by no means to the extent he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) wished; he (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) absolutely
would not walk away from them; and at any crossing or any crowd, when
Mr. Price was only calling out, <div class="bookquote">"Come, girls; come, Fan; come, Sue,
take care of yourselves; keep a sharp lookout!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Price</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) would give them his (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>)
particular attendance.

<p/>Once fairly in the dockyard, he (<font color='blue'><b>Fan</b></font>) began to reckon upon some happy
intercourse with Fanny, as they were very soon joined by a brother
lounger of Mr. Price’s, who was come to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daily survey of how
things went on, and who must prove a far more worthy companion than
himself; and after a time the two officers seemed very well satisfied
going about together, and discussing matters of equal and never-failing
interest, while the young people sat down upon some timbers in the
yard, or found a seat on board a vessel in the stocks which they all
went to look at. Fanny was most conveniently in want of rest. Crawford
could not have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) more fatigued or more ready to sit down; but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could have wished her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister away. A quick-looking girl of Susan’s
age was the very worst third in the world: totally different from Lady
Bertram, all eyes and ears; and there was no introducing the main point
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must content himself with being only generally
agreeable, and letting Susan have her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) share of entertainment, with the
indulgence, now and then, of a look or hint for the better-informed and
conscious Fanny. Norfolk was what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had mostly to talk of: there he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had been some time, and everything there was rising in importance from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) present schemes. Such a man could come from no place, no society,
without importing something to amuse; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) journeys and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acquaintance
were all of use, and Susan was entertained in a way quite new to her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>).
For Fanny, somewhat more was related than the accidental agreeableness
of the parties he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been in. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) approbation, the particular
reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) going into Norfolk at all, at this unusual time of year,
was given. It had been real business, relative to the renewal of a
lease in which the welfare of a large and—he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) believed—industrious
family was at stake. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had suspected his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) agent of some underhand
dealing; of meaning to bias him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) against the deserving; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
determined to go himself, and thoroughly investigate the merits of the
case. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had gone, had done even more good than he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had foreseen, had
been useful to more than his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) first plan had comprehended, and was now
able to congratulate himself upon it, and to feel that in performing a
duty, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had secured agreeable recollections for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
introduced himself to some tenants whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had never seen before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had begun making acquaintance with cottages whose very existence,
though on his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own estate, had been hitherto unknown to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). This was
aimed, and well aimed, at Fanny. It was pleasing to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) speak so
properly; here he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been acting as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) ought to do. To be the friend
of the poor and the oppressed! Nothing could be more grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>);
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was on the point of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) an approving look, when it was
all frightened off by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) adding a something too pointed of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoping
soon to have an assistant, a friend, a guide in every plan of utility
or charity for Everingham: a somebody that would make Everingham and
all about it a dearer object than it had ever been yet.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) turned away, and wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) would not say such things. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
willing to allow he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) might have more good qualities than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been
wont to suppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to feel the possibility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) turning out
well at last; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) was and must ever be completely unsuited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
and ought not to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) perceived that enough had been said of Everingham, and that it would
be as well to talk of something else, and turned to Mansfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>Everingham</b></font>) could
not have chosen better; that was a topic to bring back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) attention
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looks almost instantly. It was a real indulgence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to hear
or to speak of Mansfield. Now so long divided from everybody who knew
the place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it quite the voice of a friend when he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) mentioned
it, and led the way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fond exclamations in praise of its beauties
and comforts, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) honourable tribute to its inhabitants allowed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to gratify her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own heart in the warmest eulogium, in speaking of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle as all that was clever and good, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt as having the
sweetest of all sweet tempers.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had a great attachment to Mansfield himself; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) said so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) looked
forward with the hope of spending much, very much, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) time there;
always there, or in the neighbourhood. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) particularly built upon a
very happy summer and autumn there this year; he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) felt that it would be
so: he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) depended upon it; a summer and autumn infinitely superior to the
last. As animated, as diversified, as social, but with circumstances of
superiority undescribable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mansfield, Sotherton, Thornton Lacey,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) continued; "what a society
will be comprised in those houses! And at Michaelmas, perhaps, a fourth
may be added: some small hunting-box in the vicinity of everything so
dear; for as to any partnership in Thornton Lacey, as Edmund Bertram
once good-humouredly proposed, I hope I foresee two objections: two
fair, excellent, irresistible objections to that plan."

<p/>Fanny was doubly silenced here; though when the moment was passed,
could regret that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not forced herself into the acknowledged
comprehension of one half of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) meaning, and encouraged him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to say
something more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister and Edmund. It was a subject which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
must learn to speak of, and the weakness that shrunk from it would soon
be quite unpardonable.

<p/>When Mr. Price and his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) friend had seen all that they wished, or had
time for, the others were ready to return; and in the course of their
walk back, Mr. Crawford contrived a minute’s privacy for telling Fanny
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only business in Portsmouth was to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was come
down for a couple of days on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) account, and hers only, and because he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
could not endure a longer total separation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was sorry, really
sorry; and yet in spite of this and the two or three other things which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not said, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) altogether improved since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was much more gentle, obliging, and attentive to
other people’s feelings than he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ever been at Mansfield; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) so agreeable—so _near_ being agreeable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) behaviour to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) father could not offend, and there was something particularly kind
and proper in the notice he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) took of Susan. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was decidedly improved.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wished the next day over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had come only for one day;
but it was not so very bad as she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) would have expected: the pleasure of
talking of Mansfield was so very great!

<p/>Before they parted, she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had to thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Mansfield</b></font>) for another pleasure, and one
of no trivial kind. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) father asked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to do them the honour of
taking his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mutton with them, and Fanny had time for only one thrill of
horror, before he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) declared himself prevented by a prior engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
was engaged to dinner already both for that day and the next; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
met with some acquaintance at the Crown who would not be denied; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
should have the honour, however, of waiting on them again on the
morrow, etc., and so they parted—Fanny in a state of actual felicity
from escaping so horrible an evil!

<p/>To have had him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) join their family dinner-party, and see all their
deficiencies, would have been dreadful! Rebecca’s cookery and Rebecca’s
waiting, and Betsey’s eating at table without restraint, and pulling
everything about as she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) chose, were what Fanny herself was not yet
enough inured to for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) often to make a tolerable meal. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ was nice
only from natural delicacy, but _he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)_ had been brought up in a school of
luxury and epicurism.
