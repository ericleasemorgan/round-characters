<p/>One day only had passed since Anne's conversation with Mrs Smith; but a
keener interest had succeeded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was now so little touched by Mr
Elliot's conduct, except by its effects in one quarter, that it became
a matter of course the next morning, still to defer her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) explanatory
visit in Rivers Street.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had promised to be with the Musgroves from
breakfast to dinner.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) faith was plighted, and Mr Elliot's
character, like the Sultaness Scheherazade's head, must live another
day.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) appointment punctually, however; the weather was
unfavourable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had grieved over the rain on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) friends'
account, and felt it very much on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) own, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was able to
attempt the walk.  When she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) reached the White Hart, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) way to
the proper apartment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) found herself neither arriving quite in time,
nor the first to arrive.  The party before her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) were, Mrs Musgrove,
talking to Mrs Croft, and Captain Harville to Captain Wentworth; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) immediately heard that Mary and Henrietta, too impatient to wait,
had gone out the moment it had cleared, but would be back again soon,
and that the strictest injunctions had been left with Mrs Musgrove to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) there till they returned.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had only to submit, sit down,
be outwardly composed, and feel herself plunged at once in all the
agitations which she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had merely laid her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) account of tasting a little
before the morning closed.  There was no delay, no waste of time.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
was deep in the happiness of such misery, or the misery of such
happiness, instantly.  Two minutes after her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) entering the room, Captain
Wentworth said--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We will write the letter we were talking of, Harville, now, if you
will give me materials."

 (<font color='red'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)</div><p/>Materials were at hand, on a separate table; he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) went to it, and nearly
turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) back to them all, was engrossed by writing.

<p/>Mrs Musgrove was giving Mrs Croft the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eldest daughter's
engagement, and just in that inconvenient tone of voice which was
perfectly audible while it pretended to be a whisper.  Anne felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville
seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not avoid hearing
many undesirable particulars; such as, <div class="bookquote">"how Mr Musgrove and my brother
Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter
had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what
had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished,
and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards
persuaded to think might do very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and a great deal in the same
style of open-hearted communication:  minutiae which, even with every
advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not
give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.  Mrs Croft
was attending with great good-humour, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) spoke at all, it
was very sensibly.  Anne hoped the gentlemen might each be too much
self-occupied to hear.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And so, ma'am, all these thing considered,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Musgrove</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Musgrove, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
powerful whisper, "though we could have wished it different, yet,
altogether, we did not think it fair to stand out any longer, for
Charles Hayter was quite wild about it, and Henrietta was pretty near
as bad; and so we thought they had better marry at once, and make the
best of it, as many others have done before them.  At any rate, said I,
it will be better than a long engagement."

<p/>"That is precisely what I was going to observe,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs Croft.  " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I
would rather have young people settle on a small income at once, and
have to struggle with a few difficulties together, than be involved in
a long engagement.  I always think that no mutual--"

<p/>"Oh! dear Mrs Croft,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs Musgrove, unable to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
speech, " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft</b></font>)</div>there is nothing I so abominate for young people as a long
engagement.  It is what I always protested against for my children.  It
is all very well, I used to say, for young people to be engaged, if
there is a certainty of their being able to marry in six months, or
even in twelve; but a long engagement--"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, dear ma'am,"  (<font color='red'><b>people</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Croft, "or an uncertain engagement, an
engagement which may be long.  To begin without knowing that at such a
time there will be the means of marrying, I hold to be very unsafe and
unwise, and what I think all parents should prevent as far as they can."

<p/>Anne found an unexpected interest here.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt its application to
herself, felt it in a nervous thrill all over her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and at the same
moment that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes instinctively glanced towards the distant table,
Captain Wentworth's pen ceased to move, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) head was raised, pausing,
listening, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned round the next instant to give a look, one
quick, conscious look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The two ladies continued to talk, to re-urge the same admitted truths,
and enforce them with such examples of the ill effect of a contrary
practice as had fallen within their observation, but Anne heard nothing
distinctly; it was only a buzz of words in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ear, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind was in
confusion.

<p/>Captain Harville, who had in truth been hearing none of it, now left
his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) seat, and moved to a window, and Anne seeming to watch him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>), though
it was from thorough absence of mind, became gradually sensible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
was inviting her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) stood.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) with a
smile, and a little motion of the head, which expressed, <div class="bookquote">"Come to me, I
have something to say;"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and the unaffected, easy kindness of manner
which denoted the feelings of an older acquaintance than he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) really was,
strongly enforced the invitation.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) roused herself and went to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>).
The window at which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) stood was at the other end of the room from
where the two ladies were sitting, and though nearer to Captain
Wentworth's table, not very near.  As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) joined him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), Captain
Harville's countenance re-assumed the serious, thoughtful expression
which seemed its natural character.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Look here,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), unfolding a parcel in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hand, and displaying a
small miniature painting, <div class="bookquote">"do you know who that is?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly:  Captain Benwick."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, and you may guess who it is for.  But,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>(in a deep tone,) <div class="bookquote">"it was
not done for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Miss Elliot, do you remember our walking together at
Lyme, and grieving for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)?  I little thought then--but no matter.
This was drawn at the Cape.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) met with a clever young German artist
at the Cape, and in compliance with a promise to my poor sister, sat to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), and was bringing it home for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); and I have now the charge of
getting it properly set for another!  It was a commission to me!  But
who else was there to employ?  I hope I can allow for him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).  I am not
sorry, indeed, to make it over to another.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) undertakes it;"  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>(looking
towards Captain Wentworth,) "he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is writing about it now."  And with a
quivering lip he (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) wound up the whole by adding, "Poor Fanny! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would
not have forgotten him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>) so soon!"

<p/>"No,<div class="bookquote">" replied Anne, in a low, feeling voice. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That I can easily
believe."

<p/>"It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nature.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) doted on him (<font color='blue'><b>lip</b></font>)."

<p/>"It would not be the nature of any woman who truly loved."

<p/>Captain Harville smiled, as much as to say, "Do you claim that for your
sex?<div class="bookquote">" and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) answered the question, smiling also, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes.  We certainly
do not forget you as soon as you forget us.  It is, perhaps, our fate
rather than our merit.  We cannot help ourselves.  We live at home,
quiet, confined, and our feelings prey upon us.  You are forced on
exertion.  You have always a profession, pursuits, business of some
sort or other, to take you back into the world immediately, and
continual occupation and change soon weaken impressions."

<p/>"Granting your assertion that the world does all this so soon for men
(which, however, I do not think I shall grant), it does not apply to
Benwick.  He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has not been forced upon any exertion.  The peace turned
him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) on shore at the very moment, and he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) has been living with us, in our
little family circle, ever since."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"True,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "very true; I did not recollect; but what shall we
say now, Captain Harville?  If the change be not from outward
circumstances, it must be from within; it must be nature, man's nature,
which has done the business for Captain Benwick."

<p/>"No, no, it is not man's nature.  I will not allow it to be more man's
nature than woman's to be inconstant and forget those they do love, or
have loved.  I believe the reverse.  I believe in a true analogy
between our bodily frames and our mental; and that as our bodies are
the strongest, so are our feelings; capable of bearing most rough
usage, and riding out the heaviest weather."

<p/>"Your feelings may be the strongest,<div class="bookquote">" replied Anne, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>but the same
spirit of analogy will authorise me to assert that ours are the most
tender.  Man is more robust than woman, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Man</b></font>) is not longer lived;
which exactly explains my view of the nature of their attachments.
Nay, it would be too hard upon you, if it were otherwise.  You have
difficulties, and privations, and dangers enough to struggle with.  You
are always labouring and toiling, exposed to every risk and hardship.
Your home, country, friends, all quitted.  Neither time, nor health,
nor life, to be called your own.  It would be hard, indeed" (with a
faltering voice), "if woman's feelings were to be added to all this."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We shall never agree upon this question,"  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>Captain Harville was
beginning to say, when a slight noise called their attention to Captain
Wentworth's hitherto perfectly quiet division of the room.  It was
nothing more than that his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) pen had fallen down; but Anne was startled
at finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) nearer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had supposed, and half inclined to
suspect that the pen had only fallen because he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been occupied by
them, striving to catch sounds, which yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not think he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) could
have caught.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Have you finished your letter?"  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>said Captain Harville.

<p/>"Not quite, a few lines more.  I shall have done in five minutes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no hurry on my side.  I am only ready whenever you are.  I am
in very good anchorage here,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>(smiling at Anne,) <div class="bookquote">"well supplied, and
want for nothing.  No hurry for a signal at all.  Well, Miss Elliot,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>(lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) voice,) "as I was saying we shall never agree, I suppose,
upon this point.  No man and woman, would, probably.  But let me
observe that all histories are against you--all stories, prose and
verse.  If I had such a memory as Benwick, I could bring you fifty
quotations in a moment on my side the argument, and I do not think I
ever opened a book in my life which had not something to say upon
woman's inconstancy.  Songs and proverbs, all talk of woman's
fickleness.  But perhaps you will say, these were all written by men."

<p/>"Perhaps I shall.  Yes, yes, if you please, no reference to examples in
books.  Men have had every advantage of us in telling their own story.
Education has been theirs in so much higher a degree; the pen has been
in their hands.  I will not allow books to prove anything."

<p/>"But how shall we prove anything?"

<p/>"We never shall.  We never can expect to prove any thing upon such a
point.  It is a difference of opinion which does not admit of proof.
We each begin, probably, with a little bias towards our own sex; and
upon that bias build every circumstance in favour of it which has
occurred within our own circle; many of which circumstances (perhaps
those very cases which strike us the most) may be precisely such as
cannot be brought forward without betraying a confidence, or in some
respect saying what should not be said."

<p/>"Ah!<div class="bookquote">" cried Captain Harville, in a tone of strong feeling, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>if I could
but make you comprehend what a man suffers when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a last look at
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife and children, and watches the boat that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has sent them off
in, as long as it is in sight, and then turns away and says, 'God knows
whether we ever meet again!' And then, if I could convey to you the
glow of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soul when he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) does see them again; when, coming back after a
twelvemonth's absence, perhaps, and obliged to put into another port,
he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) calculates how soon it be possible to get them there, pretending to
deceive himself, and saying, 'They cannot be here till such a day,' but
all the while hoping for them twelve hours sooner, and seeing them
arrive at last, as if Heaven had given them wings, by many hours sooner
still!  If I could explain to you all this, and all that a man can bear
and do, and glories to do, for the sake of these treasures of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
existence!  I speak, you know, only of such men as have hearts!<div class="bookquote">"
pressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own with emotion.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh!" cried Anne eagerly, "I hope I do justice to all that is felt by
you, and by those who resemble you.  God forbid that I should
undervalue the warm and faithful feelings of any of my
fellow-creatures!  I should deserve utter contempt if I dared to
suppose that true attachment and constancy were known only by woman.
No, I believe you capable of everything great and good in your married
lives.  I believe you equal to every important exertion, and to every
domestic forbearance, so long as--if I may be allowed the
expression--so long as you have an object.  I mean while the woman you
love lives, and lives for you.  All the privilege I claim for my own
sex (it is not a very enviable one; you need not covet it), is that of
loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could not immediately have uttered another sentence; her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was
too full, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) breath too much oppressed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>You are a good soul," cried Captain Harville, putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) hand on her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
arm, quite affectionately.  "There is no quarrelling with you.  And
when I think of Benwick, my tongue is tied."

<p/>Their attention was called towards the others.  Mrs Croft was taking
leave.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Here, Frederick, you and I part company, I believe,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>).  <div class="bookquote">"I am
going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.  To-night we
may have the pleasure of all meeting again at your party,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>(turning to
Anne.)  "We had your sister's card yesterday, and I understood
Frederick had a card too, though I did not see it; and you are
disengaged, Frederick, are you not, as well as ourselves?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Captain Wentworth was folding up a letter in great haste, and either
could not or would not answer fully.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), "very true; here we separate, but Harville and I shall
soon be after you; that is, Harville, if you are ready, I am in half a
minute.  I know you will not be sorry to be off.  I shall be at your
service in half a minute."

<p/>Mrs Croft left them, and Captain Wentworth, having sealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) letter
with great rapidity, was indeed ready, and had even a hurried, agitated
air, which shewed impatience to be gone.  Anne knew not how to
understand it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the kindest <div class="bookquote">"Good morning, God bless you!"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>from
Captain Harville, but from him (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) not a word, nor a look!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had passed
out of the room without a look!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had only time, however, to move closer to the table where he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had
been writing, when footsteps were heard returning; the door opened, it
was himself.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) begged their pardon, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had forgotten his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) gloves,
and instantly crossing the room to the writing table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) drew out a
letter from under the scattered paper, placed it before Anne with eyes
of glowing entreaty fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for a time, and hastily collecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
gloves, was again out of the room, almost before Mrs Musgrove was aware
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) being in it: the work of an instant!

<p/>The revolution which one instant had made in Anne, was almost beyond
expression.  The letter, with a direction hardly legible, to <div class="bookquote">"Miss A.
E.--,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was evidently the one which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had been folding so hastily.
While supposed to be writing only to Captain Benwick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had been also
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)!  On the contents of that letter depended all which this
world could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Anything was possible, anything might be
defied rather than suspense.  Mrs Musgrove had little arrangements of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own at her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own table; to their protection she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) must trust, and
sinking into the chair which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had occupied, succeeding to the very
spot where he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had leaned and written, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eyes devoured the following
words:


<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can listen no longer in silence.  I must speak to you by such means
as are within my reach.  You pierce my soul.  I am half agony, half
hope.  Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are
gone for ever.  I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your
own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago.  Dare
not say that man forgets sooner than  woman, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love has an
earlier death.  I have loved none but you.  Unjust I may have been,
weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.  You alone have
brought me to Bath.  For you alone, I think and plan.  Have you not
seen this?  Can you fail to have understood my wishes?  I had not
waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think
you must have penetrated mine.  I can hardly write.  I am every instant
hearing something which overpowers me.  You sink your voice, but I can
distinguish the tones of that voice when they would be lost on others.
Too good, too excellent creature!  You do us justice, indeed.  You do
believe that there is true attachment and constancy among men.  Believe
it to be most fervent, most undeviating, in F. W.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I must go, uncertain of my fate; but I shall return hither, or follow
your party, as soon as possible.  A word, a look, will be enough to
decide whether I enter your father's house this evening or never."


<p/>Such a letter was not to be soon recovered from.  Half an hour's
solitude and reflection might have tranquillized her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>); but the ten
minutes only which now passed before she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was interrupted, with all the
restraints of her (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) situation, could do nothing towards tranquillity.
Every moment rather brought fresh agitation.  It was overpowering
happiness.  And before she (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) was beyond the first stage of full
sensation, Charles, Mary, and Henrietta all came in.

<p/>The absolute necessity of seeming like herself produced then an
immediate struggle; but after a while she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) could do no more.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) began
not to understand a word they said, and was obliged to plead
indisposition and excuse herself.  They could then see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) looked
very ill, were shocked and concerned, and would not stir without her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
for the world.  This was dreadful.  Would they only have gone away, and
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) in the quiet possession of that room it would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
cure; but to have them all standing or waiting around her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was
distracting, and in desperation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would go home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"By all means, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Musgrove</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Musgrove, "go home directly, and
take care of yourself, that you may be fit for the evening.  I wish
Sarah was here to doctor you, but I am no doctor myself.  Charles, ring
and order a chair.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) must not walk."

<p/>But the chair would never do.  Worse than all!  To lose the possibility
of speaking two words to Captain Wentworth in the course of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) quiet,
solitary progress up the town (and she (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) felt almost certain of meeting
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)) could not be borne.  The chair was earnestly protested against,
and Mrs Musgrove, who thought only of one sort of illness, having
assured herself with some anxiety, that there had been no fall in the
case; that Anne had not at any time lately slipped down, and got a blow
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) head; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was perfectly convinced of having had no fall;
could part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheerfully, and depend on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) better at
night.

<p/>Anxious to omit no possible precaution, Anne struggled, and said--

<p/>"I am afraid, ma'am, that it is not perfectly understood.  Pray be so
good as to mention to the other gentlemen that we hope to see your
whole party this evening.  I am afraid there had been some mistake; and
I wish you particularly to assure Captain Harville and Captain
Wentworth, that we hope to see them both."

<p/>"Oh! my dear, it is quite understood, I give you my word.  Captain
Harville has no thought but of going."

<p/>"Do you think so?  But I am afraid; and I should be so very sorry.
Will you promise me to mention it, when you see them again?  You will
see them both this morning, I dare say.  Do promise me."

<p/>"To be sure I will, if you wish it.  Charles, if you see Captain
Harville anywhere, remember to give Miss Anne's message.  But indeed,
my dear, you need not be uneasy.  Captain Harville holds himself quite
engaged, I'll answer for it; and Captain Wentworth the same, I dare
say."

<p/>Anne could do no more; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart prophesied some mischance to damp
the perfection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felicity.  It could not be very lasting, however.
Even if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not come to Camden Place himself, it would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
power to send an intelligible sentence by Captain Harville.  Another
momentary vexation occurred.  Charles, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) real concern and good
nature, would go home with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); there was no preventing him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).  This was
almost cruel.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not be long ungrateful; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was sacrificing
an engagement at a gunsmith's, to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) set off
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), with no feeling but gratitude apparent.

<p/>They were on Union Street, when a quicker step behind, a something of
familiar sound, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) two moments' preparation for the sight of
Captain Wentworth.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) joined them; but, as if irresolute whether to
join or to pass on, said nothing, only looked.  Anne could command
herself enough to receive that look, and not repulsively.  The cheeks
which had been pale now glowed, and the movements which had hesitated
were decided.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side.  Presently, struck by a sudden
thought, Charles said--

<p/>"Captain Wentworth, which way are you going?  Only to Gay Street, or
farther up the town?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hardly know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Captain</b></font>)</div>replied Captain Wentworth, surprised.

<p/>"Are you going as high as Belmont?  Are you going near Camden Place?
Because, if you are, I shall have no scruple in asking you to take my
place, and give Anne your arm to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's door.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) is rather done
for this morning, and must not go so far without help, and I ought to
be at that fellow's in the Market Place.  He (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) promised me the sight of a
capital gun he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is just going to send off; said he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) would keep it
unpacked to the last possible moment, that I might see it; and if I do
not turn back now, I have no chance.  By his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) description, a good deal
like the second size double-barrel of mine, which you shot with one day
round Winthrop."

<p/>There could not be an objection.  There could be only the most proper
alacrity, a most obliging compliance for public view; and smiles reined
in and spirits dancing in private rapture.  In half a minute Charles
was at the bottom of Union Street again, and the other two proceeding
together:  and soon words enough had passed between them to decide
their direction towards the comparatively quiet and retired gravel
walk, where the power of conversation would make the present hour a
blessing indeed, and prepare it for all the immortality which the
happiest recollections of their own future lives could bestow.  There
they exchanged again those feelings and those promises which had once
before seemed to secure everything, but which had been followed by so
many, many years of division and estrangement.  There they returned
again into the past, more exquisitely happy, perhaps, in their
re-union, than when it had been first projected; more tender, more
tried, more fixed in a knowledge of each other's character, truth, and
attachment; more equal to act, more justified in acting.  And there, as
they slowly paced the gradual ascent, heedless of every group around
them, seeing neither sauntering politicians, bustling housekeepers,
flirting girls, nor nursery-maids and children, they could indulge in
those retrospections and acknowledgements, and especially in those
explanations of what had directly preceded the present moment, which
were so poignant and so ceaseless in interest.  All the little
variations of the last week were gone through; and of yesterday and
today there could scarcely be an end.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had not mistaken him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>).  Jealousy of Mr Elliot had been the retarding
weight, the doubt, the torment.  That had begun to operate in the very
hour of first meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) in Bath; that had returned, after a short
suspension, to ruin the concert; and that had influenced him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) in
everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had said and done, or omitted to say and do, in the last
four-and-twenty hours.  It had been gradually yielding to the better
hopes which her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) looks, or words, or actions occasionally encouraged; it
had been vanquished at last by those sentiments and those tones which
had reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) talked with Captain Harville; and under the
irresistible governance of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had seized a sheet of paper, and
poured out his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>Of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had then written, nothing was to be retracted or qualified.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) persisted in having loved none but her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) had never been
supplanted.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) never even believed himself to see her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) equal.  Thus
much indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) was obliged to acknowledge:  that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had been constant
unconsciously, nay unintentionally; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had meant to forget her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>),
and believed it to be done.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had imagined himself indifferent, when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had only been angry; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had been unjust to her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) merits, because
he (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had been a sufferer from them.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) character was now fixed on his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
mind as perfection itself, maintaining the loveliest medium of
fortitude and gentleness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was obliged to acknowledge that only
at Uppercross had he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) learnt to do her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) justice, and only at Lyme had he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
begun to understand himself.  At Lyme, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had received lessons of more
than one sort.  The passing admiration of Mr Elliot had at least roused
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and the scenes on the Cobb and at Captain Harville's had fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)
superiority.

<p/>In his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) preceding attempts to attach himself to Louisa Musgrove (the
attempts of angry pride), he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had for ever felt it to
be impossible; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had not cared, could not care, for Louisa;
though till that day, till the leisure for reflection which followed
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had not understood the perfect excellence of the mind with which
Louisa's could so ill bear a comparison, or the perfect unrivalled hold
it possessed over his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own.  There, he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had learnt to distinguish between
the steadiness of principle and the obstinacy of self-will, between the
darings of heedlessness and the resolution of a collected mind.  There
he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had seen everything to exalt in his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) estimation the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had
lost; and there begun to deplore the pride, the folly, the madness of
resentment, which had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) from trying to regain her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) when thrown in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) way.

<p/>From that period his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) penance had become severe.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had no sooner been
free from the horror and remorse attending the first few days of
Louisa's accident, no sooner begun to feel himself alive again, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
had begun to feel himself, though alive, not at liberty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I found,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), "that I was considered by Harville an engaged man!
That neither Harville nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) wife entertained a doubt of our mutual
attachment.  I was startled and shocked.  To a degree, I could
contradict this instantly; but, when I began to reflect that others
might have felt the same--her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own family, nay, perhaps herself--I was
no longer at my own disposal.  I was hers in honour if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wished it.
I had been unguarded.  I had not thought seriously on this subject
before.  I had not considered that my excessive intimacy must have its
danger of ill consequence in many ways; and that I had no right to be
trying whether I could attach myself to either of the girls, at the
risk of raising even an unpleasant report, were there no other ill
effects.  I had been grossly wrong, and must abide the consequences."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) found too late, in short, that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had entangled himself; and that
precisely as he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) became fully satisfied of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not caring for Louisa at
all, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) must regard himself as bound to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), if her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sentiments for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
were what the Harvilles supposed.  It determined him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to leave Lyme, and
await her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) complete recovery elsewhere.  He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) would gladly weaken, by any
fair means, whatever feelings or speculations concerning him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) might
exist; and he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went, therefore, to his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) brother's, meaning after a while
to return to Kellynch, and act as circumstances might require.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I was six weeks with Edward,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), "and saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) happy.  I could
have no other pleasure.  I deserved none.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) enquired after you very
particularly; asked even if you were personally altered, little
suspecting that to my eye you could never alter."

<p/>Anne smiled, and let it pass.  It was too pleasing a blunder for a
reproach.  It is something for a woman to be assured, in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
eight-and-twentieth year, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has not lost one charm of earlier
youth; but the value of such homage was inexpressibly increased to
Anne, by comparing it with former words, and feeling it to be the
result, not the cause of a revival of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) warm attachment.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) had remained in Shropshire, lamenting the blindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own
pride, and the blunders of his (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) own calculations, till at once released
from Louisa by the astonishing and felicitous intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
engagement with Benwick.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Here,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>), "ended the worst of my state; for now I could at least
put myself in the way of happiness; I could exert myself; I could do
something.  But to be waiting so long in inaction, and waiting only for
evil, had been dreadful.  Within the first five minutes I said, <div class="bookquote">'I will
be at Bath on Wednesday,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and I was.  Was it unpardonable to think it
worth my while to come? and to arrive with some degree of hope?  You
were single.  It was possible that you might retain the feelings of the
past, as I did; and one encouragement happened to be mine.  I could
never doubt that you would be loved and sought by others, but I knew to
a certainty that you had refused one man, at least, of better
pretensions than myself; and I could not help often saying, 'Was this
for me?'"

<p/>Their first meeting in Milsom Street afforded much to be said, but the
concert still more.  That evening seemed to be made up of exquisite
moments.  The moment of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) stepping forward in the Octagon Room to
speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>):  the moment of Mr Elliot's appearing and tearing her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
away, and one or two subsequent moments, marked by returning hope or
increasing despondency, were dwelt on with energy.

<p/>"To see you,<div class="bookquote">" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), " (<font color='red'><b>the midst</b></font>)</div>in the midst of those who could not be my
well-wishers; to see your cousin close by you, conversing and smiling,
and feel all the horrible eligibilities and proprieties of the match!
To consider it as the certain wish of every being who could hope to
influence you!  Even if your own feelings were reluctant or
indifferent, to consider what powerful supports would be his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>)!  Was it
not enough to make the fool of me which I appeared?  How could I look
on without agony?  Was not the very sight of the friend who sat behind
you, was not the recollection of what had been, the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
influence, the indelible, immoveable impression of what persuasion had
once done--was it not all against me?"

<p/>"You should have distinguished,<div class="bookquote">" replied Anne.  " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You should not have
suspected me now; the case is so different, and my age is so different.
If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to
persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk.  When I yielded,
I thought it was to duty, but no duty could be called in aid here.  In
marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred,
and all duty violated."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps I ought to have reasoned thus,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) replied, "but I could not.
I could not derive benefit from the late knowledge I had acquired of
your character.  I could not bring it into play; it was overwhelmed,
buried, lost in those earlier feelings which I had been smarting under
year after year.  I could think of you only as one who had yielded, who
had given me up, who had been influenced by any one rather than by me.
I saw you with the very person who had guided you in that year of
misery.  I had no reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) of less authority now.  The
force of habit was to be added."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should have thought,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne, "that my manner to yourself might
have spared you much or all of this."

<p/>"No, no! your manner might be only the ease which your engagement to
another man would give.  I left you in this belief; and yet, I was
determined to see you again.  My spirits rallied with the morning, and
I felt that I had still a motive for remaining here."

<p/>At last Anne was at home again, and happier than any one in that house
could have conceived.  All the surprise and suspense, and every other
painful part of the morning dissipated by this conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
re-entered the house so happy as to be obliged to find an alloy in some
momentary apprehensions of its being impossible to last.  An interval
of meditation, serious and grateful, was the best corrective of
everything dangerous in such high-wrought felicity; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
room, and grew steadfast and fearless in the thankfulness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
enjoyment.

<p/>The evening came, the drawing-rooms were lighted up, the company
assembled.  It was but a card party, it was but a mixture of those who
had never met before, and those who met too often; a commonplace
business, too numerous for intimacy, too small for variety; but Anne
had never found an evening shorter.  Glowing and lovely in sensibility
and happiness, and more generally admired than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) thought about or
cared for, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had cheerful or forbearing feelings for every creature
around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Mr Elliot was there; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) avoided, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).
The Wallises, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had amusement in understanding them.  Lady Dalrymple
and Miss Carteret--they would soon be innoxious cousins to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>)
cared not for Mrs Clay, and had nothing to blush for in the public
manners of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) father and sister.  With the Musgroves, there was the
happy chat of perfect ease; with Captain Harville, the kind-hearted
intercourse of brother and sister; with Lady Russell, attempts at
conversation, which a delicious consciousness cut short; with Admiral
and Mrs Croft, everything of peculiar cordiality and fervent interest,
which the same consciousness sought to conceal; and with Captain
Wentworth, some moments of communications continually occurring, and
always the hope of more, and always the knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) being there.

<p/>It was in one of these short meetings, each apparently occupied in
admiring a fine display of greenhouse plants, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) said--

<p/>"I have been thinking over the past, and trying impartially to judge of
the right and wrong, I mean with regard to myself; and I must believe
that I was right, much as I suffered from it, that I was perfectly
right in being guided by the friend whom you will love better than you
do now.  To me, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) was in the place of a parent.  Do not mistake me,
however.  I am not saying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) did not err in her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) advice.  It was,
perhaps, one of those cases in which advice is good or bad only as the
event decides; and for myself, I certainly never should, in any
circumstance of tolerable similarity, give such advice.  But I mean,
that I was right in submitting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>), and that if I had done
otherwise, I should have suffered more in continuing the engagement
than I did even in giving it up, because I should have suffered in my
conscience.  I have now, as far as such a sentiment is allowable in
human nature, nothing to reproach myself with; and if I mistake not, a
strong sense of duty is no bad part of a woman's portion."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), looked at Lady Russell, and looking again at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>),
replied, as if in cool deliberation--

<p/>"Not yet.  But there are hopes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) being forgiven in time.  I trust
to being in charity with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) soon.  But I too have been thinking over
the past, and a  question has suggested itself, whether there may not
have been one person more my enemy even than that lady?  My own self.
Tell me if, when I returned to England in the year eight, with a few
thousand pounds, and was posted into the Laconia, if I had then written
to you, would you have answered my letter?  Would you, in short, have
renewed the engagement then?"

<p/>"Would I!<div class="bookquote">" was all her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) answer; but the accent was decisive enough.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>Good God!" he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">"you would!  It is not that I did not think of
it, or desire it, as what could alone crown all my other success; but I
was proud, too proud to ask again.  I did not understand you.  I shut
my eyes, and would not understand you, or do you justice.  This is a
recollection which ought to make me forgive every one sooner than
myself.  Six years of separation and suffering might have been spared.
It is a sort of pain, too, which is new to me.  I have been used to the
gratification of believing myself to earn every blessing that I
enjoyed.  I have valued myself on honourable toils and just rewards.
Like other great men under reverses,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) added, with a smile. "I must
endeavour to subdue my mind to my fortune.  I must learn to brook being
happier than I deserve."
