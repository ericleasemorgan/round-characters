<p/>Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of
two thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters, was
entailed, in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and
their mother’s fortune, though ample for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) situation in life,
could but ill supply the deficiency of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) father had been
an attorney in Meryton, and had left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) four thousand pounds.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had a sister married to a Mr. Phillips, who had been a clerk
to their father and succeeded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) in the business, and a brother
settled in London in a respectable line of trade.

<p/>The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most
convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually
tempted thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to
their aunt and to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two
youngest of the family, Catherine and Lydia, were particularly
frequent in these attentions; their minds were more vacant than
their sisters’, and when nothing better offered, a walk to
Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish
conversation for the evening; and however bare of news the
country in general might be, they always contrived to learn some
from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both
with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia
regiment in the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter,
and Meryton was the headquarters.

<p/>Their visits to Mrs. Phillips were now productive of the most
interesting intelligence. Every day added something to their
knowledge of the officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings
were not long a secret, and at length they began to know the
officers themselves. Mr. Phillips visited them all, and this
opened to his (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces a store of felicity unknown before. They
could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr. Bingley’s large
fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their mother, was
worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an
ensign.

<p/>After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject,
Mr. Bennet coolly observed:

<p/>"From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must
be two of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it
some time, but I am now convinced.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with
perfect indifference, continued to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) admiration of
Captain Carter, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hope of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) in the course of the
day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) was going the next morning to London.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am astonished, my dear," said Mrs. Bennet, "that you should be
so ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think
slightingly of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own,
however."

<p/>"If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of
it."

<p/>"Yes—but as it happens, they are all of them very clever."

<p/>"This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not
agree. I had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every
particular, but I must so far differ from you as to think our two
youngest daughters uncommonly foolish."

<p/>"My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the
sense of their father and mother. When they get to our age, I
dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do.
I remember the time when I liked a red coat myself very well—and,
indeed, so I do still at my heart; and if a smart young colonel,
with five or six thousand a year, should want one of my girls I
shall not say nay to him (<font color='blue'><b>colonel</b></font>); and I thought Colonel Forster looked
very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
regimentals."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mamma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia, "my aunt says that Colonel Forster and
Captain Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did
when they first came; she (<font color='blue'><b>Watson</b></font>) sees them now very often standing in
Clarke’s library."

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman
with a note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the
servant waited for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was eagerly calling out, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter
read,

<p/>"Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) say?
Well, Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is from Miss Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, and then read it aloud.

<p/>"MY DEAR FRIEND,—
<div class="bookquote">"If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa
and me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest
of our lives, for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women
can never end without a quarrel. Come as soon as you can on
receipt of this. My brother and the gentlemen are to dine with
the officers.—Yours ever,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>DEAR FRIEND</b></font>)</div>CAROLINE BINGLEY"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"With the officers!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>cried Lydia. <div class="bookquote">"I wonder my aunt did not tell
us of _that_."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Dining out,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, "that is very unlucky."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Can I have the carriage?"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, my dear, you had better go on horseback, because it seems
likely to rain; and then you must stay all night."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"That would be a good scheme,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "if you were sure
that they would not offer to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) home."

<p/>"Oh! but the gentlemen will have Mr. Bingley’s chaise to go to
Meryton, and the Hursts have no horses to theirs."

<p/>"I had much rather go in the coach."

<p/>"But, my dear, your father cannot spare the horses, I am sure.
They are wanted in the farm, Mr. Bennet, are they not?"

<p/>"They are wanted in the farm much oftener than I can get them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But if you have got them to-day,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "my mother’s
purpose will be answered."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did at last extort from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father an acknowledgment that the
horses were engaged. Jane was therefore obliged to go on
horseback, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to the door with many
cheerful prognostics of a bad day. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hopes were answered; Jane
had not been gone long before it rained hard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sisters were
uneasy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother was delighted. The rain continued
the whole evening without intermission; Jane certainly could not
come back.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet more
than once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own.
Till the next morning, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was not aware of all the
felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a
servant from Netherfield brought the following note for
Elizabeth:

<p/>"MY DEAREST LIZZY,—
<div class="bookquote">"I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to
be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday. My kind friends
will not hear of my returning till I am better. They insist also
on my seeing Mr. Jones—therefore do not be alarmed if you should
hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) having been to me—and, excepting a sore throat and
headache, there is not much the matter with me.—Yours, etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy/LIZZY</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the
note aloud, "if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of
illness—if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should die, it would be a comfort to know that it
was all in pursuit of Mr. Bingley, and under your orders."

<p/>"Oh! I am not afraid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dying. People do not die of little
trifling colds. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) will be taken good care of. As long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
stays there, it is all very well. I would go and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) if I
could have the carriage."

<p/>Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, was determined to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>),
though the carriage was not to be had; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was no
horsewoman, walking was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only alternative. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
resolution.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How can you be so silly,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, "as to think of such
a thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when
you get there."

<p/>"I shall be very fit to see Jane—which is all I want."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) father, "to send for the
horses?"

<p/>"No, indeed, I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is
nothing when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back
by dinner."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I admire the activity of your benevolence,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>observed Mary, "but
every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my
opinion, exertion should always be in proportion to what is
required."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We will go as far as Meryton with you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine and
Lydia. Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young
ladies set off together.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If we make haste,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, as they walked along, "perhaps we
may see something of Captain Carter before he (<font color='blue'><b>Carter</b></font>) goes."

<p/>In Meryton they parted; the two youngest repaired to the lodgings
of one of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walk
alone, crossing field after field at a quick pace, jumping over
stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity, and
finding herself at last within view of the house, with weary
ankles, dirty stockings, and a face glowing with the warmth of
exercise.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was shown into the breakfast-parlour, where all but Jane were
assembled, and where her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) appearance created a great deal of
surprise. That she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) should have walked three miles so early in the
day, in such dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible
to Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that
they held her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in contempt for it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was received, however, very
politely by them; and in their brother’s manners there was
something better than politeness; there was good humour and
kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst nothing at
all. The former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy
which exercise had given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) complexion, and doubt as to the
occasion’s justifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coming so far alone. The latter was
thinking only of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) breakfast.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) enquiries after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister were not very favourably answered.
Miss Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and
not well enough to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the
fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) note
how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed for such a visit, was delighted at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
entrance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not equal, however, to much conversation, and
when Miss Bingley left them together, could attempt little
besides expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>When breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters; and
Elizabeth began to like them herself, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw how much
affection and solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary
came, and having examined his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) patient, said, as might be
supposed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had caught a violent cold, and that they must
endeavour to get the better of it; advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to return to bed,
and promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) some draughts. The advice was followed readily,
for the feverish symptoms increased, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head ached acutely.
Elizabeth did not quit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) room for a moment; nor were the other
ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had, in fact,
nothing to do elsewhere.

<p/>When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must go, and
very unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) the carriage,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) only wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane
testified such concern in parting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), that Miss Bingley was
obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to
remain at Netherfield for the present. Elizabeth most thankfully
consented, and a servant was dispatched to Longbourn to acquaint
the family with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stay and bring back a supply of clothes.
