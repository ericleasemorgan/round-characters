<p/>Sir Walter Elliot, of Kellynch Hall, in Somersetshire, was a man who,
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own amusement, never took up any book but the Baronetage; there
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) found occupation for an idle hour, and consolation in a distressed
one; there his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) faculties were roused into admiration and respect, by
contemplating the limited remnant of the earliest patents; there any
unwelcome sensations, arising from domestic affairs changed naturally
into pity and contempt as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) turned over the almost endless creations
of the last century; and there, if every other leaf were powerless, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
could read his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own history with an interest which never failed.  This
was the page at which the favourite volume always opened:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"ELLIOT OF KELLYNCH HALL.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div>Walter Elliot, born March 1, 1760, married, July 15, 1784, Elizabeth,
daughter of James Stevenson, Esq. of South Park, in the county of
Gloucester, by which lady (who died 1800) he (<font color='blue'><b>Stevenson</b></font>) has issue Elizabeth, born
June 1, 1785; Anne, born August 9, 1787; a still-born son, November 5,
1789; Mary, born November 20, 1791."

<p/>Precisely such had the paragraph originally stood from the printer's
hands; but Sir Walter had improved it by adding, for the information of
himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) family, these words, after the date of Mary's birth--
<div class="bookquote">"Married, December 16, 1810, Charles, son and heir of Charles Musgrove,
Esq. of Uppercross, in the county of Somerset,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>and by inserting most
accurately the day of the month on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Then followed the history and rise of the ancient and respectable
family, in the usual terms; how it had been first settled in Cheshire;
how mentioned in Dugdale, serving the office of high sheriff,
representing a borough in three successive parliaments, exertions of
loyalty, and dignity of baronet, in the first year of Charles II, with
all the Marys and Elizabeths they had married; forming altogether two
handsome duodecimo pages, and concluding with the arms and
motto:--<div class="bookquote">"Principal seat, Kellynch Hall, in the county of Somerset,"  (<font color='red'><b>the Marys Elizabeths</b></font>)</div>and
Sir Walter's handwriting again in this finale:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Heir presumptive, William Walter Elliot, Esq., great grandson of the
second Sir Walter."

 (<font color='red'><b>Walter/Walter Elliot/William Walter Elliot</b></font>)</div><p/>Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character;
vanity of person and of situation.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been remarkably handsome in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man.  Few women
could think more of their personal appearance than he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, nor could
the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) held
in society.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to
the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united
these gifts, was the constant object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) warmest respect and
devotion.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) good looks and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) rank had one fair claim on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attachment; since
to them he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must have owed a wife of very superior character to any
thing deserved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own.  Lady Elliot had been an excellent woman,
sensible and amiable; whose judgement and conduct, if they might be
pardoned the youthful infatuation which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) Lady Elliot, had never
required indulgence afterwards.--She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had humoured, or softened, or
concealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) failings, and promoted his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) real respectability for
seventeen years; and though not the very happiest being in the world
herself, had found enough in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) duties, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friends, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) children,
to attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to life, and make it no matter of indifference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was called on to quit them.--Three girls, the two eldest
sixteen and fourteen, was an awful legacy for a mother to bequeath, an
awful charge rather, to confide to the authority and guidance of a
conceited, silly father.  She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had, however, one very intimate friend, a
sensible, deserving woman, who had been brought, by strong attachment
to herself, to settle close by her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), in the village of Kellynch; and on
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) kindness and advice, Lady Elliot mainly relied for the best help
and maintenance of the good principles and instruction which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had
been anxiously giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) daughters.

<p/>This friend, and Sir Walter, did not marry, whatever might have been
anticipated on that head by their acquaintance.  Thirteen years had
passed away since Lady Elliot's death, and they were still near
neighbours and intimate friends, and one remained a widower, the other
a widow.

<p/>That Lady Russell, of steady age and character, and extremely well
provided for, should have no thought of a second marriage, needs no
apology to the public, which is rather apt to be unreasonably
discontented when a woman does marry again, than when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) does not; but
Sir Walter's continuing in singleness requires explanation.  Be it
known then, that Sir Walter, like a good father, (having met with one
or two private disappointments in very unreasonable applications),
prided himself on remaining single for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) dear daughters' sake.  For
one daughter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) eldest, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would really have given up any thing,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had not been very much tempted to do.  Elizabeth had
succeeded, at sixteen, to all that was possible, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother's rights
and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most
happily.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two other children were of very inferior value.  Mary had
acquired a little artificial importance, by becoming Mrs Charles
Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of
character, which must have placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) high with any people of real
understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) word had no
weight, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) convenience was always to give way--she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was only Anne.

<p/>To Lady Russell, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a most dear and highly valued
god-daughter, favourite, and friend.  Lady Russell loved them all; but
it was only in Anne that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could fancy the mother to revive again.

<p/>A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father had
found little to admire in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), (so totally different were her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) delicate
features and mild dark eyes from his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own), there could be nothing in
them, now that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was faded and thin, to excite his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) esteem. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
never indulged much hope, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had now none, of ever reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name in
any other page of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favourite work.  All equality of alliance must
rest with Elizabeth, for Mary had merely connected herself with an old
country family of respectability and large fortune, and had therefore
given all the honour and received none: Elizabeth would, one day or
other, marry suitably.

<p/>It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at twenty-nine than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
was ten years before; and, generally speaking, if there has been
neither ill health nor anxiety, it is a time of life at which scarcely
any charm is lost.  It was so with Elizabeth, still the same handsome
Miss Elliot that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had begun to be thirteen years ago, and Sir Walter
might be excused, therefore, in forgetting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) age, or, at least, be
deemed only half a fool, for thinking himself and Elizabeth as blooming
as ever, amidst the wreck of the good looks of everybody else; for he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
could plainly see how old all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) family and acquaintance
were growing.  Anne haggard, Mary coarse, every face in the
neighbourhood worsting, and the rapid increase of the crow's foot about
Lady Russell's temples had long been a distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth did not quite equal her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father in personal contentment.
Thirteen years had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mistress of Kellynch Hall, presiding and
directing with a self-possession and decision which could never have
given the idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being younger than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was.  For thirteen years
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) been doing the honours, and laying down the domestic law at
home, and leading the way to the chaise and four, and walking
immediately after Lady Russell out of all the drawing-rooms and
dining-rooms in the country.  Thirteen winters' revolving frosts had
seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) opening every ball of credit which a scanty neighbourhood
afforded, and thirteen springs shewn their blossoms, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) travelled
up to London with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father, for a few weeks' annual enjoyment of the
great world.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had the remembrance of all this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had the
consciousness of being nine-and-twenty to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) some regrets and
some apprehensions; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was fully satisfied of being still quite as
handsome as ever, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) approach to the years of danger, and
would have rejoiced to be certain of being properly solicited by
baronet-blood within the next twelvemonth or two.  Then might she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) again
take up the book of books with as much enjoyment as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) early youth,
but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) liked it not.  Always to be presented with the date of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own birth and see no marriage follow but that of a youngest sister,
made the book an evil; and more than once, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father had left it
open on the table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) closed it, with averted eyes, and
pushed it away.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had had a disappointment, moreover, which that book, and especially
the history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own family, must ever present the remembrance of.
The heir presumptive, the very William Walter Elliot, Esq., whose
rights had been so generously supported by her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father, had disappointed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had, while a very young girl, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had known him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be,
in the event of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) having no brother, the future baronet, meant to
marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father had always meant that she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) should.  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not
been known to them as a boy; but soon after Lady Elliot's death, Sir
Walter had sought the acquaintance, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) overtures had not
been met with any warmth, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had persevered in seeking it, making
allowance for the modest drawing-back of youth; and, in one of their
spring excursions to London, when Elizabeth was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first bloom, Mr
Elliot had been forced into the introduction.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was at that time a very young man, just engaged in the study of the
law; and Elizabeth found him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) extremely agreeable, and every plan in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
favour was confirmed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was invited to Kellynch Hall; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was talked
of and expected all the rest of the year; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) never came.  The
following spring he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was seen again in town, found equally agreeable,
again encouraged, invited, and expected, and again he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) did not come; and
the next tidings were that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was married.  Instead of pushing his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
fortune in the line marked out for the heir of the house of Elliot, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
had purchased independence by uniting himself to a rich woman of
inferior birth.

<p/>Sir Walter had resented it.  As the head of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
ought to have been consulted, especially after taking the young man so
publicly by the hand; <div class="bookquote">"For they must have been seen together,"  (<font color='red'><b>the man</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
observed, <div class="bookquote">"once at Tattersall's, and twice in the lobby of the House of
Commons."   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) disapprobation was expressed, but apparently very little
regarded.  Mr Elliot had attempted no apology, and shewn himself as
unsolicitous of being longer noticed by the family, as Sir Walter
considered him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) unworthy of it:  all acquaintance between them had
ceased.

<p/>This very awkward history of Mr Elliot was still, after an interval of
several years, felt with anger by Elizabeth, who had liked the man for
himself, and still more for being her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father's heir, and whose strong
family pride could see only in him (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) a proper match for Sir Walter
Elliot's eldest daughter.  There was not a baronet from A to Z whom her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
feelings could have so willingly acknowledged as an equal.  Yet so
miserably had he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conducted himself, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was at this present
time (the summer of 1814) wearing black ribbons for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wife, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could
not admit him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to be worth thinking of again.  The disgrace of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) first
marriage might, perhaps, as there was no reason to suppose it
perpetuated by offspring, have been got over, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) not done worse;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had, as by the accustomary intervention of kind friends, they
had been informed, spoken most disrespectfully of them all, most
slightingly and contemptuously of the very blood he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) belonged to, and
the honours which were hereafter to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) own.  This could not be
pardoned.

<p/>Such were Elizabeth Elliot's sentiments and sensations; such the cares
to alloy, the agitations to vary, the sameness and the elegance, the
prosperity and the nothingness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) scene of life; such the feelings
to give interest to a long, uneventful residence in one country circle,
to fill the vacancies which there were no habits of utility abroad, no
talents or accomplishments for home, to occupy.

<p/>But now, another occupation and solicitude of mind was beginning to be
added to these.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father was growing distressed for money.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
knew, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) now took up the Baronetage, it was to drive the
heavy bills of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) tradespeople, and the unwelcome hints of Mr
Shepherd, his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) agent, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Shepherd</b></font>) thoughts.  The Kellynch property was
good, but not equal to Sir Walter's apprehension of the state required
in its possessor.  While Lady Elliot lived, there had been method,
moderation, and economy, which had just kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) within his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) income; but
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had died all such right-mindedness, and from that period he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
had been constantly exceeding it.  It had not been possible for him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) to
spend less; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had done nothing but what Sir Walter Elliot was
imperiously called on to do; but blameless as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not only
growing dreadfully in debt, but was hearing of it so often, that it
became vain to attempt concealing it longer, even partially, from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
daughter.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) some hints of it the last spring in town;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had gone so far even as to say, "Can we retrench?  Does it occur to
you that there is any one article in which we can retrench?" and
Elizabeth, to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) justice, had, in the first ardour of female alarm,
set seriously to think what could be done, and had finally proposed
these two branches of economy, to cut off some unnecessary charities,
and to refrain from new furnishing the drawing-room; to which
expedients she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) afterwards added the happy thought of their taking no
present down to Anne, as had been the usual yearly custom.  But these
measures, however good in themselves, were insufficient for the real
extent of the evil, the whole of which Sir Walter found himself obliged
to confess to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon afterwards.  Elizabeth had nothing to propose of
deeper efficacy.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt herself ill-used and unfortunate, as did her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father; and they were neither of them able to devise any means of
lessening their expenses without compromising their dignity, or
relinquishing their comforts in a way not to be borne.

<p/>There was only a small part of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) estate that Sir Walter could dispose
of; but had every acre been alienable, it would have made no
difference.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had condescended to mortgage as far as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had the
power, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would never condescend to sell.  No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) would never
disgrace his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) name so far.  The Kellynch estate should be transmitted
whole and entire, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had received it.

<p/>Their two confidential friends, Mr Shepherd, who lived in the
neighbouring market town, and Lady Russell, were called to advise them;
and both father and daughter seemed to expect that something should be
struck out by one or the other to remove their embarrassments and
reduce their expenditure, without involving the loss of any indulgence
of taste or pride.
