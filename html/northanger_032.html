<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Morland’s surprise on being applied to by Mr. Tilney for
their consent to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) marrying their daughter was, for a few minutes,
considerable, it having never entered their heads to suspect an
attachment on either side; but as nothing, after all, could be more
natural than Catherine’s being beloved, they soon learnt to consider it
with only the happy agitation of gratified pride, and, as far as they
alone were concerned, had not a single objection to start. His (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) pleasing
manners and good sense were self-evident recommendations; and having
never heard evil of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), it was not their way to suppose any evil could
be told. Goodwill supplying the place of experience, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) character
needed no attestation. <div class="bookquote">"Catherine would make a sad, heedless young
housekeeper to be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother’s foreboding remark; but quick
was the consolation of there being nothing like practice.

<p/>There was but one obstacle, in short, to be mentioned; but till that
one was removed, it must be impossible for them to sanction the
engagement. Their tempers were mild, but their principles were steady,
and while his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) parent so expressly forbade the connection, they could
not allow themselves to encourage it. That the general should come
forward to solicit the alliance, or that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) should even very heartily
approve it, they were not refined enough to make any parading
stipulation; but the decent appearance of consent must be yielded, and
that once obtained—and their own hearts made them trust that it could
not be very long denied—their willing approbation was instantly to
follow. His (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) _consent_ was all that they wished for. They were no more
inclined than entitled to demand his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) _money_. Of a very considerable
fortune, his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) son was, by marriage settlements, eventually secure; his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
present income was an income of independence and comfort, and under
every pecuniary view, it was a match beyond the claims of their
daughter.

<p/>The young people could not be surprised at a decision like this. They
felt and they deplored—but they could not resent it; and they parted,
endeavouring to hope that such a change in the general, as each
believed almost impossible, might speedily take place, to unite them
again in the fullness of privileged affection. Henry returned to what
was now his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) only home, to watch over his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) young plantations, and extend
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) improvements for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) sake, to whose share in them he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) looked
anxiously forward; and Catherine remained at Fullerton to cry. Whether
the torments of absence were softened by a clandestine correspondence,
let us not inquire. Mr. and Mrs. Morland never did—they had been too
kind to exact any promise; and whenever Catherine received a letter,
as, at that time, happened pretty often, they always looked another
way.

<p/>The anxiety, which in this state of their attachment must be the
portion of Henry and Catherine, and of all who loved either, as to its
final event, can hardly extend, I fear, to the bosom of my readers, who
will see in the tell-tale compression of the pages before them, that we
are all hastening together to perfect felicity. The means by which
their early marriage was effected can be the only doubt: what probable
circumstance could work upon a temper like the general’s? The
circumstance which chiefly availed was the marriage of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) daughter
with a man of fortune and consequence, which took place in the course
of the summer—an accession of dignity that threw him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) into a fit of good
humour, from which he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) did not recover till after Eleanor had obtained
his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) forgiveness of Henry, and his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) permission for him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">"to be a fool if
he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) liked it!"

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>The marriage of Eleanor Tilney, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) removal from all the evils of such
a home as Northanger had been made by Henry’s banishment, to the home
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) choice and the man of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) choice, is an event which I expect to
give general satisfaction among all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) acquaintance. My own joy on the
occasion is very sincere. I know no one more entitled, by unpretending
merit, or better prepared by habitual suffering, to receive and enjoy
felicity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) partiality for this gentleman was not of recent origin;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been long withheld only by inferiority of situation from
addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) unexpected accession to title and fortune had
removed all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) difficulties; and never had the general loved his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
daughter so well in all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) hours of companionship, utility, and
patient endurance as when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) first hailed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">"Your Ladyship!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
husband was really deserving of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>); independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) peerage, his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
wealth, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) attachment, being to a precision the most charming
young man in the world. Any further definition of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) merits must be
unnecessary; the most charming young man in the world is instantly
before the imagination of us all. Concerning the one in question,
therefore, I have only to add—aware that the rules of composition
forbid the introduction of a character not connected with my fable—that
this was the very gentleman whose negligent servant left behind him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>)
that collection of washing-bills, resulting from a long visit at
Northanger, by which my heroine was involved in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) most
alarming adventures.

<p/>The influence of the viscount and viscountess in their brother’s behalf
was assisted by that right understanding of Mr. Morland’s circumstances
which, as soon as the general would allow himself to be informed, they
were qualified to give. It taught him (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) had been scarcely more
misled by Thorpe’s first boast of the family wealth than by his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>)
subsequent malicious overthrow of it; that in no sense of the word were
they necessitous or poor, and that Catherine would have three thousand
pounds. This was so material an amendment of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) late expectations that
it greatly contributed to smooth the descent of his (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) pride; and by no
means without its effect was the private intelligence, which he (<font color='blue'><b>general</b></font>) was at
some pains to procure, that the Fullerton estate, being entirely at the
disposal of its present proprietor, was consequently open to every
greedy speculation.

<p/>On the strength of this, the general, soon after Eleanor’s marriage,
permitted his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) son to return to Northanger, and thence made him (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) the
bearer of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) consent, very courteously worded in a page full of empty
professions to Mr. Morland. The event which it authorized soon
followed: Henry and Catherine were married, the bells rang, and
everybody smiled; and, as this took place within a twelvemonth from the
first day of their meeting, it will not appear, after all the dreadful
delays occasioned by the general’s cruelty, that they were essentially
hurt by it. To begin perfect happiness at the respective ages of
twenty-six and eighteen is to do pretty well; and professing myself
moreover convinced that the general’s unjust interference, so far from
being really injurious to their felicity, was perhaps rather conducive
to it, by improving their knowledge of each other, and adding strength
to their attachment, I leave it to be settled, by whomsoever it may
concern, whether the tendency of this work be altogether to recommend
parental tyranny, or reward filial disobedience.
