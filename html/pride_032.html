<p/>Elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning, and writing to
Jane while Mrs. Collins and Maria were gone on business into the
village, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was startled by a ring at the door, the certain
signal of a visitor. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had heard no carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought it
not unlikely to be Lady Catherine, and under that apprehension
was putting away her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) half-finished letter that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might escape
all impertinent questions, when the door opened, and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very
great surprise, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Darcy only, entered the room.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed astonished too on finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) alone, and apologised for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) intrusion by letting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had understood all the
ladies were to be within.

<p/>They then sat down, and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) enquiries after Rosings were
made, seemed in danger of sinking into total silence. It was
absolutely necessary, therefore, to think of something, and in
this emergence recollecting _when_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) last in
Hertfordshire, and feeling curious to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would say on
the subject of their hasty departure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observed:

<p/>"How very suddenly you all quitted Netherfield last November, Mr.
Darcy! It must have been a most agreeable surprise to Mr. Bingley
to see you all after him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) so soon; for, if I recollect right, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
went but the day before. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were well, I hope,
when you left London?"

<p/>"Perfectly so, I thank you."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was to receive no other answer, and, after a
short pause added:

<p/>"I think I have understood that Mr. Bingley has not much idea of
ever returning to Netherfield again?"

<p/>"I have never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) say so; but it is probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) may
spend very little of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) time there in the future. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has many
friends, and is at a time of life when friends and engagements
are continually increasing."

<p/>"If he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) means to be but little at Netherfield, it would be better
for the neighbourhood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should give up the place entirely,
for then we might possibly get a settled family there. But,
perhaps, Mr. Bingley did not take the house so much for the
convenience of the neighbourhood as for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own, and we must
expect him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to keep it or quit it on the same principle."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should not be surprised,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, "if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) were to give it
up as soon as any eligible purchase offers."

<p/>Elizabeth made no answer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was afraid of talking longer of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
friend; and, having nothing else to say, was now determined to
leave the trouble of finding a subject to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) took the hint, and soon began with, "This seems a very
comfortable house. Lady Catherine, I believe, did a great deal to
it when Mr. Collins first came to Hunsford."

<p/>"I believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did—and I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not have bestowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
kindness on a more grateful object.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>Mr. Collins appears to be very fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) choice of a
wife."

<p/>"Yes, indeed, his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friends may well rejoice in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) having met with
one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>),
or have made him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happy if they had. My friend has an excellent
understanding—though I am not certain that I consider her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
marrying Mr. Collins as the wisest thing she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ever did. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) seems
perfectly happy, however, and in a prudential light it is
certainly a very good match for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)."

<p/>"It must be very agreeable for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be settled within so easy a
distance of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own family and friends."

<p/>"An easy distance, do you call it? It is nearly fifty miles."

<p/>"And what is fifty miles of good road? Little more than half a
day’s journey. Yes, I call it a very easy distance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should never have considered the distance as one of the
_advantages_ of the match,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth. "I should never have
said Mrs. Collins was settled _near_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family."

<p/>"It is a proof of your own attachment to Hertfordshire. Anything
beyond the very neighbourhood of Longbourn, I suppose, would
appear far."

<p/>As he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) spoke there was a sort of smile which Elizabeth fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
understood; he (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) must be supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be thinking of Jane and
Netherfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) blushed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) answered:

<p/>"I do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) family. The far and the near must be relative, and depend on
many varying circumstances. Where there is fortune to make the
expenses of travelling unimportant, distance becomes no evil. But
that is not the case _here_. Mr. and Mrs. Collins have a
comfortable income, but not such a one as will allow of frequent
journeys—and I am persuaded my friend would not call herself
_near_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) family under less than _half_ the present distance."

<p/>Mr. Darcy drew his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) chair a little towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and said, "_You_
cannot have a right to such very strong local attachment. _You_
cannot have been always at Longbourn."

<p/>Elizabeth looked surprised. The gentleman experienced some change
of feeling; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) drew back his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) chair, took a newspaper from the
table, and glancing over it, said, in a colder voice:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Are you pleased with Kent?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>A short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued, on either
side calm and concise—and soon put an end to by the entrance of
Charlotte and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister, just returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) walk. The
_tête-à-tête_ surprised them. Mr. Darcy related the mistake which
had occasioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) intruding on Miss Bennet, and after sitting a
few minutes longer without saying much to anybody, went away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What can be the meaning of this?"  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was gone. <div class="bookquote">"My dear, Eliza, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must be in love with you, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
would never have called on us in this familiar way."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>But when Elizabeth told of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) silence, it did not seem very
likely, even to Charlotte’s wishes, to be the case; and after
various conjectures, they could at last only suppose his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) visit to
proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do, which was
the more probable from the time of year. All field sports were
over. Within doors there was Lady Catherine, books, and a
billiard-table, but gentlemen cannot always be within doors; and
in the nearness of the Parsonage, or the pleasantness of the walk
to it, or of the people who lived in it, the two cousins found a
temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day.
They called at various times of the morning, sometimes
separately, sometimes together, and now and then accompanied by
their aunt. It was plain to them all that Colonel Fitzwilliam
came because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) had pleasure in their society, a persuasion which
of course recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) still more; and Elizabeth was reminded
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own satisfaction in being with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), as well as by his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
evident admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former favourite George
Wickham; and though, in comparing them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw there was less
captivating softness in Colonel Fitzwilliam’s manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) might have the best informed mind.

<p/>But why Mr. Darcy came so often to the Parsonage, it was more
difficult to understand. It could not be for society, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
lips; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did speak, it seemed the effect of necessity
rather than of choice—a sacrifice to propriety, not a pleasure to
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seldom appeared really animated. Mrs. Collins knew
not what to make of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Colonel Fitzwilliam’s occasionally
laughing at his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) stupidity, proved that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was generally
different, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could not have told
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would liked to have believed this change the
effect of love, and the object of that love her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend Eliza, she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
set herself seriously to work to find it out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) watched him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
whenever they were at Rosings, and whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came to Hunsford;
but without much success. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) certainly looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend a
great deal, but the expression of that look was disputable. It
was an earnest, steadfast gaze, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) often doubted whether
there were much admiration in it, and sometimes it seemed nothing
but absence of mind.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had once or twice suggested to Elizabeth the possibility of
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) being partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), but Elizabeth always laughed at the
idea; and Mrs. Collins did not think it right to press the
subject, from the danger of raising expectations which might only
end in disappointment; for in her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) opinion it admitted not of a
doubt, that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) friend’s dislike would vanish, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could
suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) power.

<p/>In her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) kind schemes for Elizabeth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sometimes planned her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
marrying Colonel Fitzwilliam. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) was beyond comparison the most
pleasant man; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) certainly admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) situation in life
was most eligible; but, to counterbalance these advantages, Mr.
Darcy had considerable patronage in the church, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin
could have none at all.
