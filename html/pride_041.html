<p/>The first week of their return was soon gone. The second began.
It was the last of the regiment’s stay in Meryton, and all the
young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace. The
dejection was almost universal. The elder Miss Bennets alone were
still able to eat, drink, and sleep, and pursue the usual course
of their employments. Very frequently were they reproached for
this insensibility by Kitty and Lydia, whose own misery was
extreme, and who could not comprehend such hard-heartedness in
any of the family.

<p/>"Good Heaven! what is to become of us? What are we to do?<div class="bookquote">" would
they often exclaim in the bitterness of woe. " (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>How can you be
smiling so, Lizzy?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Their affectionate mother shared all their grief; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) remembered
what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had herself endured on a similar occasion,
five-and-twenty years ago.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure," said she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), "I cried for two days together when
Colonel Miller’s regiment went away. I thought I should have
broken my heart."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sure I shall break _mine_,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>said Lydia.

<p/>"If one could but go to Brighton!<div class="bookquote">" observed Mrs. Bennet.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, yes!—if one could but go to Brighton! But papa is so
disagreeable."

<p/>"A little sea-bathing would set me up forever."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And my aunt Phillips is sure it would do _me_ a great deal of
good,"  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>added Kitty.

<p/>Such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through
Longbourn House. Elizabeth tried to be diverted by them; but all
sense of pleasure was lost in shame. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt anew the justice of
Mr. Darcy’s objections; and never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) been so much disposed
to pardon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) interference in the views of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend.

<p/>But the gloom of Lydia’s prospect was shortly cleared away; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) received an invitation from Mrs. Forster, the wife of the
colonel of the regiment, to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) to Brighton. This
invaluable friend was a very young woman, and very lately
married. A resemblance in good humour and good spirits had
recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Lydia to each other, and out of their _three_
months’ acquaintance they had been intimate _two_.

<p/>The rapture of Lydia on this occasion, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) adoration of Mrs.
Forster, the delight of Mrs. Bennet, and the mortification of
Kitty, are scarcely to be described. Wholly inattentive to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
sister’s feelings, Lydia flew about the house in restless
ecstasy, calling for everyone’s congratulations, and laughing and
talking with more violence than ever; whilst the luckless Kitty
continued in the parlour repining at her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) fate in terms as
unreasonable as her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) accent was peevish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot see why Mrs. Forster should not ask _me_ as well as
Lydia,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), "Though I am _not_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) particular friend. I
have just as much right to be asked as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has, and more too, for
I am two years older."

<p/>In vain did Elizabeth attempt to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reasonable, and Jane to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) resigned. As for Elizabeth herself, this invitation was
so far from exciting in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the same feelings as in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother
and Lydia, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) considered it as the death warrant of all
possibility of common sense for the latter; and detestable as
such a step must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) were it known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not help
secretly advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father not to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) go. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) represented
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) all the improprieties of Lydia’s general behaviour, the
little advantage she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could derive from the friendship of such a
woman as Mrs. Forster, and the probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) being yet more
imprudent with such a companion at Brighton, where the
temptations must be greater than at home. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
attentively, and then said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lydia will never be easy until she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) has exposed herself in some
public place or other, and we can never expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) to do it with
so little expense or inconvenience to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family as under the
present circumstances."

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"If you were aware,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "of the very great
disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of
Lydia’s unguarded and imprudent manner—nay, which has already
arisen from it, I am sure you would judge differently in the
affair."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Already arisen?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>repeated Mr. Bennet. "What, has she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) frightened
away some of your lovers? Poor little Lizzy! But do not be cast
down. Such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a
little absurdity are not worth a regret. Come, let me see the
list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by Lydia’s
folly."

<p/>"Indeed you are mistaken. I have no such injuries to resent. It
is not of particular, but of general evils, which I am now
complaining. Our importance, our respectability in the world must
be affected by the wild volatility, the assurance and disdain of
all restraint which mark Lydia’s character. Excuse me, for I must
speak plainly. If you, my dear father, will not take the trouble
of checking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) exuberant spirits, and of teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
present pursuits are not to be the business of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will
soon be beyond the reach of amendment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) character will be
fixed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) will, at sixteen, be the most determined flirt
that ever made herself or her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family ridiculous; a flirt, too, in
the worst and meanest degree of flirtation; without any
attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person; and, from the
ignorance and emptiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mind, wholly unable to ward off
any portion of that universal contempt which her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) rage for
admiration will excite. In this danger Kitty also is
comprehended. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) will follow wherever Lydia leads. Vain,
ignorant, idle, and absolutely uncontrolled! Oh! my dear father,
can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and
despised wherever they are known, and that their sisters will not
be often involved in the disgrace?"

<p/>Mr. Bennet saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) whole heart was in the subject, and
affectionately taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hand said in reply:

<p/>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my love. Wherever you and Jane are
known you must be respected and valued; and you will not appear
to less advantage for having a couple of—or I may say, three—very
silly sisters. We shall have no peace at Longbourn if Lydia does
not go to Brighton. Let her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) go, then. Colonel Forster is a
sensible man, and will keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) out of any real mischief; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>)
is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody. At
Brighton she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) will be of less importance even as a common flirt
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) has been here. The officers will find women better worth
their notice. Let us hope, therefore, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) being there may
teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) own insignificance. At any rate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) cannot grow
many degrees worse, without authorising us to lock her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) up for the
rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) life."

<p/>With this answer Elizabeth was forced to be content; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
opinion continued the same, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) disappointed and
sorry. It was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nature, however, to increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
vexations by dwelling on them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was confident of having
performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) duty, and to fret over unavoidable evils, or
augment them by anxiety, was no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) disposition.

<p/>Had Lydia and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother known the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) conference
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) father, their indignation would hardly have found
expression in their united volubility. In Lydia’s imagination, a
visit to Brighton comprised every possibility of earthly
happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw, with the creative eye of fancy, the streets
of that gay bathing-place covered with officers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw herself
the object of attention, to tens and to scores of them at present
unknown. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw all the glories of the camp—its tents stretched
forth in beauteous uniformity of lines, crowded with the young
and the gay, and dazzling with scarlet; and, to complete the
view, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) saw herself seated beneath a tent, tenderly flirting
with at least six officers at once.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) known her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sister sought to tear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) from such prospects
and such realities as these, what would have been her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sensations?
They could have been understood only by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother, who might
have felt nearly the same. Lydia’s going to Brighton was all that
consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) melancholy conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband’s never
intending to go there himself.

<p/>But they were entirely ignorant of what had passed; and their
raptures continued, with little intermission, to the very day of
Lydia’s leaving home.

<p/>Elizabeth was now to see Mr. Wickham for the last time. Having
been frequently in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) return, agitation
was pretty well over; the agitations of former partiality
entirely so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had even learnt to detect, in the very
gentleness which had first delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), an affectation and a
sameness to disgust and weary. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) present behaviour to
herself, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a fresh source of displeasure, for the
inclination he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) soon testified of renewing those intentions which
had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve,
after what had since passed, to provoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lost all concern
for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in finding herself thus selected as the object of such
idle and frivolous gallantry; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) steadily repressed
it, could not but feel the reproof contained in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) believing,
that however long, and for whatever cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) attentions had
been withdrawn, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vanity would be gratified, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) preference
secured at any time by their renewal.

<p/>On the very last day of the regiment’s remaining at Meryton, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
dined, with others of the officers, at Longbourn; and so little
was Elizabeth disposed to part from him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in good humour, that on
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) making some enquiry as to the manner in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) time had
passed at Hunsford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mentioned Colonel Fitzwilliam’s and Mr.
Darcy’s having both spent three weeks at Rosings, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was acquainted with the former.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked surprised, displeased, alarmed; but with a moment’s
recollection and a returning smile, replied, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had formerly
seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) often; and, after observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was a very
gentlemanlike man, asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer
was warmly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour. With an air of indifference he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) soon
afterwards added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How long did you say he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was at Rosings?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Nearly three weeks."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And you saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) frequently?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, almost every day."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manners are very different from his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) cousin’s."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Yes, very different. But I think Mr. Darcy improves upon
acquaintance."

<p/>"Indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Wickham with a look which did not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).
" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>And pray, may I ask?—" But checking himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, in a
gayer tone, <div class="bookquote">"Is it in address that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) improves? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) deigned to
add aught of civility to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ordinary style?—for I dare not
hope,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) continued in a lower and more serious tone, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is
improved in essentials."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, no!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. "In essentials, I believe, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is very
much what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ever was."

<p/>While she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, Wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to
rejoice over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) words, or to distrust their meaning. There was a
something in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) countenance which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) listen with an
apprehensive and anxious attention, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When I said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) improved on acquaintance, I did not mean
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) mind or his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manners were in a state of improvement, but
that, from knowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) better, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) disposition was better
understood."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Wickham’s alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and
agitated look; for a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was silent, till, shaking off
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) embarrassment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) again, and said in the
gentlest of accents:

<p/>"You, who so well know my feeling towards Mr. Darcy, will readily
comprehend how sincerely I must rejoice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is wise enough to
assume even the _appearance_ of what is right. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride, in that
direction, may be of service, if not to himself, to many others,
for it must only deter him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from such foul misconduct as I have
suffered by. I only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which
you, I imagine, have been alluding, is merely adopted on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
visits to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) aunt, of whose good opinion and judgement he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) stands
much in awe. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fear of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) has always operated, I know, when
they were together; and a good deal is to be imputed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wish
of forwarding the match with Miss de Bourgh, which I am certain
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has very much at heart."

<p/>Elizabeth could not repress a smile at this, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered
only by a slight inclination of the head. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wanted
to engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) on the old subject of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) grievances, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
in no humour to indulge him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). The rest of the evening passed with
the _appearance_, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) side, of usual cheerfulness, but with no
further attempt to distinguish Elizabeth; and they parted at last
with mutual civility, and possibly a mutual desire of never
meeting again.

<p/>When the party broke up, Lydia returned with Mrs. Forster to
Meryton, from whence they were to set out early the next morning.
The separation between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) family was rather noisy than
pathetic. Kitty was the only one who shed tears; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) did weep
from vexation and envy. Mrs. Bennet was diffuse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) good
wishes for the felicity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and impressive in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
injunctions that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should not miss the opportunity of enjoying
herself as much as possible—advice which there was every reason
to believe would be well attended to; and in the clamorous
happiness of Lydia herself in bidding farewell, the more gentle
adieus of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters were uttered without being heard.
