<p/>In spite of Udolpho and the dressmaker, however, the party from
Pulteney Street reached the Upper Rooms in very good time. The Thorpes
and James Morland were there only two minutes before them; and Isabella
having gone through the usual ceremonial of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend with the
most smiling and affectionate haste, of admiring the set of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) gown,
and envying the curl of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hair, they followed their chaperones, arm
in arm, into the ballroom, whispering to each other whenever a thought
occurred, and supplying the place of many ideas by a squeeze of the
hand or a smile of affection.

<p/>The dancing began within a few minutes after they were seated; and
James, who had been engaged quite as long as his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sister, was very
importunate with Isabella to stand up; but John was gone into the
card-room to speak to a friend, and nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) declared, should
induce her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) to join the set before her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) dear Catherine could join it too.
<div class="bookquote">"I assure you,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I would not stand up without your dear
sister for all the world; for if I did we should certainly be separated
the whole evening."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Catherine accepted this kindness with gratitude,
and they continued as they were for three minutes longer, when
Isabella, who had been talking to James on the other side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>),
turned again to his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) sister and whispered, <div class="bookquote">"My dear creature, I am
afraid I must leave you, your brother is so amazingly impatient to
begin; I know you will not mind my going away, and I dare say John will
be back in a moment, and then you may easily find me out."  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Catherine,
though a little disappointed, had too much good nature to make any
opposition, and the others rising up, Isabella had only time to press
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend’s hand and say, <div class="bookquote">"Good-bye, my dear love,"  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>before they
hurried off. The younger Miss Thorpes being also dancing, Catherine was
left to the mercy of Mrs. Thorpe and Mrs. Allen, between whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) now
remained. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not help being vexed at the non-appearance of Mr.
Thorpe, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) not only longed to be dancing, but was likewise aware
that, as the real dignity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) situation could not be known, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
sharing with the scores of other young ladies still sitting down all
the discredit of wanting a partner. To be disgraced in the eye of the
world, to wear the appearance of infamy while her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart is all purity,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) actions all innocence, and the misconduct of another the true
source of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) debasement, is one of those circumstances which
peculiarly belong to the heroine’s life, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fortitude under it
what particularly dignifies her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) character. Catherine had fortitude too;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) suffered, but no murmur passed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lips.

<p/>From this state of humiliation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was roused, at the end of ten
minutes, to a pleasanter feeling, by seeing, not Mr. Thorpe, but Mr.
Tilney, within three yards of the place where they sat; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) seemed to be
moving that way, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) did not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and therefore the smile and
the blush, which his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sudden reappearance raised in Catherine, passed
away without sullying her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heroic importance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked as handsome and
as lively as ever, and was talking with interest to a fashionable and
pleasing-looking young woman, who leant on his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) arm, and whom Catherine
immediately guessed to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister; thus unthinkingly throwing away a
fair opportunity of considering him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) lost to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forever, by being
married already. But guided only by what was simple and probable, it
had never entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head that Mr. Tilney could be married; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not
behaved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had not talked, like the married men to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been
used; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never mentioned a wife, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had acknowledged a sister.
From these circumstances sprang the instant conclusion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister’s
now being by his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) side; and therefore, instead of turning of a deathlike
paleness and falling in a fit on Mrs. Allen’s bosom, Catherine sat
erect, in the perfect use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) senses, and with cheeks only a little
redder than usual.

<p/>Mr. Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) companion, who continued, though slowly, to
approach, were immediately preceded by a lady, an acquaintance of Mrs.
Thorpe; and this lady stopping to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), they, as belonging to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), stopped likewise, and Catherine, catching Mr. Tilney’s eye,
instantly received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) the smiling tribute of recognition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
returned it with pleasure, and then advancing still nearer, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) spoke
both to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) and Mrs. Allen, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was very civilly acknowledged.
<div class="bookquote">"I am very happy to see you again, sir, indeed; I was afraid you had
left Bath."  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) fears, and said that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had quitted
it for a week, on the very morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) having had the pleasure of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>).

<p/>"Well, sir, and I dare say you are not sorry to be back again, for it
is just the place for young people—and indeed for everybody else too. I
tell Mr. Allen, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) talks of being sick of it, that I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
should not complain, for it is so very agreeable a place, that it is
much better to be here than at home at this dull time of year. I tell
him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) is quite in luck to be sent here for his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) health."

<p/>"And I hope, madam, that Mr. Allen will be obliged to like the place,
from finding it of service to him (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)."

<p/>"Thank you, sir. I have no doubt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) will. A neighbour of ours, Dr.
Skinner, was here for his (<font color='blue'><b>Skinner</b></font>) health last winter, and came away quite
stout."

<p/>"That circumstance must give great encouragement."

<p/>"Yes, sir—and Dr. Skinner and his (<font color='blue'><b>Skinner</b></font>) family were here three months; so I
tell Mr. Allen he (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) must not be in a hurry to get away."

<p/>Here they were interrupted by a request from Mrs. Thorpe to Mrs. Allen,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) would move a little to accommodate Mrs. Hughes and Miss Tilney
with seats, as they had agreed to join their party. This was
accordingly done, Mr. Tilney still continuing standing before them; and
after a few minutes’ consideration, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) asked Catherine to dance with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). This compliment, delightful as it was, produced severe
mortification to the lady; and in giving her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) denial, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sorrow on the occasion so very much as if she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) really felt it, that had
Thorpe, who joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) just afterwards, been half a minute earlier, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
might have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) sufferings rather too acute. The very easy
manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) waiting did not
by any means reconcile her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) lot; nor did the particulars
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) entered into while they were standing up, of the horses and
dogs of the friend whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) had just left, and of a proposed exchange of
terriers between them, interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) so much as to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) looking
very often towards that part of the room where she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) had left Mr. Tilney.
Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) dear Isabella, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) particularly longed to point out that
gentleman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could see nothing. They were in different sets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was
separated from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) party, and away from all her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) acquaintance; one
mortification succeeded another, and from the whole she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) deduced this
useful lesson, that to go previously engaged to a ball does not
necessarily increase either the dignity or enjoyment of a young lady.
From such a moralizing strain as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was suddenly roused by a
touch on the shoulder, and turning round, perceived Mrs. Hughes
directly behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>), attended by Miss Tilney and a gentleman. <div class="bookquote">"I beg
your pardon, Miss Morland,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), "for this liberty—but I cannot
anyhow get to Miss Thorpe, and Mrs. Thorpe said she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) was sure you would
not have the least objection to letting in this young lady by you."
Mrs. Hughes could not have applied to any creature in the room more
happy to oblige her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) than Catherine. The young ladies were introduced to
each other, Miss Tilney expressing a proper sense of such goodness,
Miss Morland with the real delicacy of a generous mind making light of
the obligation; and Mrs. Hughes, satisfied with having so respectably
settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) young charge, returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hughes</b></font>) party.

<p/>Miss Tilney had a good figure, a pretty face, and a very agreeable
countenance; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) air, though it had not all the decided pretension,
the resolute stylishness of Miss Thorpe’s, had more real elegance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
manners showed good sense and good breeding; they were neither shy nor
affectedly open; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seemed capable of being young, attractive, and
at a ball without wanting to fix the attention of every man near her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>),
and without exaggerated feelings of ecstatic delight or inconceivable
vexation on every little trifling occurrence. Catherine, interested at
once by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appearance and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) relationship to Mr. Tilney, was desirous
of being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and readily talked therefore whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
could think of anything to say, and had courage and leisure for saying
it. But the hindrance thrown in the way of a very speedy intimacy, by
the frequent want of one or more of these requisites, prevented their
doing more than going through the first rudiments of an acquaintance,
by informing themselves how well the other liked Bath, how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
admired its buildings and surrounding country, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew, or
played, or sang, and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was fond of riding on horseback.

<p/>The two dances were scarcely concluded before Catherine found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) arm
gently seized by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) faithful Isabella, who in great spirits exclaimed,
"At last I have got you. My dearest creature, I have been looking for
you this hour. What could induce you to come into this set, when you
knew I was in the other? I have been quite wretched without you."

<p/>"My dear Isabella, how was it possible for me to get at you? I could
not even see where you were."

<p/>"So I told your brother all the time—but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) would not believe me. Do go
and see for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), Mr. Morland, said I—but all in vain—he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) would not stir
an inch. Was not it so, Mr. Morland? But you men are all so
immoderately lazy! I have been scolding him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to such a degree, my dear
Catherine, you would be quite amazed. You know I never stand upon
ceremony with such people."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Look at that young lady with the white beads round her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) head,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>whispered Catherine, detaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend from James. "It is Mr.
Tilney’s sister."

<p/>"Oh! Heavens! You don’t say so! Let me look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) this moment. What a
delightful girl! I never saw anything half so beautiful! But where is
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all-conquering brother? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in the room? Point him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) out to me this
instant, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is. I die to see him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Mr. Morland, you are not to
listen. We are not talking about you."

<p/>"But what is all this whispering about? What is going on?"

<p/>"There now, I knew how it would be. You men have such restless
curiosity! Talk of the curiosity of women, indeed! ’Tis nothing. But be
satisfied, for you are not to know anything at all of the matter."

<p/>"And is that likely to satisfy me, do you think?"

<p/>"Well, I declare I never knew anything like you. What can it signify to
you, what we are talking of. Perhaps we are talking about you;
therefore I would advise you not to listen, or you may happen to hear
something not very agreeable."

<p/>In this commonplace chatter, which lasted some time, the original
subject seemed entirely forgotten; and though Catherine was very well
pleased to have it dropped for a while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not avoid a little
suspicion at the total suspension of all Isabella’s impatient desire to
see Mr. Tilney. When the orchestra struck up a fresh dance, James would
have led his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) fair partner away, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) resisted. <div class="bookquote">"I tell you, Mr.
Morland,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cried, "I would not do such a thing for all the world.
How can you be so teasing; only conceive, my dear Catherine, what your
brother wants me to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wants me to dance with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again, though I
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it is a most improper thing, and entirely against the
rules. It would make us the talk of the place, if we were not to change
partners."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my honour,"  (<font color='red'><b>James</b></font>)</div>said James, "in these public assemblies, it is as
often done as not."

<p/>"Nonsense, how can you say so? But when you men have a point to carry,
you never stick at anything. My sweet Catherine, do support me;
persuade your brother how impossible it is. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that it would
quite shock you to see me do such a thing; now would not it?"

<p/>"No, not at all; but if you think it wrong, you had much better
change."

<p/>"There," cried Isabella, "you hear what your sister says, and yet you
will not mind her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). Well, remember that it is not my fault, if we set
all the old ladies in Bath in a bustle. Come along, my dearest
Catherine, for heaven’s sake, and stand by me." And off they went, to
regain their former place. John Thorpe, in the meanwhile, had walked
away; and Catherine, ever willing to give Mr. Tilney an opportunity of
repeating the agreeable request which had already flattered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) once,
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way to Mrs. Allen and Mrs. Thorpe as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) could, in the
hope of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) still with them—a hope which, when it proved to be
fruitless, she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) felt to have been highly unreasonable. <div class="bookquote">"Well, my dear,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, impatient for praise of her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) son, <div class="bookquote">"I hope you have had
an agreeable partner."

 (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Very agreeable, madam."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I am glad of it. John has charming spirits, has not he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did you meet Mr. Tilney, my dear?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Allen.

<p/>"No, where is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)?"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was with us just now, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was so tired of lounging about,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was resolved to go and dance; so I thought perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would ask
you, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) met with you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Where can he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be?"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, looking round; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not
looked round long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) leading a young lady to the dance.

<p/>"Ah! He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) has got a partner; I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had asked _you_," said Mrs. Allen;
and after a short silence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) added, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is a very agreeable young
man."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) is, Mrs. Allen,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe/Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, smiling complacently; "I
must say it, though I _am_ his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) mother, that there is not a more
agreeable young man in the world."

<p/>This inapplicable answer might have been too much for the comprehension
of many; but it did not puzzle Mrs. Allen, for after only a moment’s
consideration, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) said, in a whisper to Catherine, "I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
thought I was speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) son."

<p/>Catherine was disappointed and vexed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed to have missed by so
little the very object she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had had in view; and this persuasion did not
incline her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to a very gracious reply, when John Thorpe came up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
soon afterwards and said, <div class="bookquote">"Well, Miss Morland, I suppose you and I are
to stand up and jig it together again."

 (<font color='red'><b>John/John Thorpe</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, no; I am much obliged to you, our two dances are over; and,
besides, I am tired, and do not mean to dance any more."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Do not you? Then let us walk about and quiz people. Come along with
me, and I will show you the four greatest quizzers in the room; my two
younger sisters and their partners. I have been laughing at them this
half hour."

<p/>Again Catherine excused herself; and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) walked off to quiz his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>)
sisters by himself. The rest of the evening she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found very dull; Mr.
Tilney was drawn away from their party at tea, to attend that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
partner; Miss Tilney, though belonging to it, did not sit near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), and
James and Isabella were so much engaged in conversing together that the
latter had no leisure to bestow more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend than one smile, one
squeeze, and one <div class="bookquote">"dearest Catherine."
