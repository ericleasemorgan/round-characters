<p/>As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the
latter communicated a piece of news to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, which in spite of
all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew before of Marianne’s imprudence and want of thought,
surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),
with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a horse, one
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had bred himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estate in Somersetshire, and which was
exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was
not in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mother’s plan to keep any horse, that if she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) were to alter
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) resolution in favour of this gift, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must buy another for the
servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable
to receive them, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had accepted the present without hesitation, and
told her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) sister of it in raptures.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) intends to send his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) groom into Somersetshire immediately for it,"
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) added, "and when it arrives we will ride every day. You shall share
its use with me. Imagine to yourself, my dear Elinor, the delight of a
gallop on some of these downs."

<p/>Most unwilling was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to awaken from such a dream of felicity to
comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for
some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant,
the expense would be a trifle; Mama she (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) was sure would never object to
it; and any horse would do for _him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>);_ he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) might always get one at the
park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then
ventured to doubt the propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) receiving such a present from a
man so little, or at least so lately known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). This was too much.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are mistaken, Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) warmly, "in supposing I know very
little of Willoughby. I have not known him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long indeed, but I am much
better acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), than I am with any other creature in the
world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is
to determine intimacy;—it is disposition alone. Seven years would be
insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven
days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of
greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from
Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together
for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."

<p/>Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister’s temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) the more to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion. But by an appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affection for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent
mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly
subdued; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promised not to tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother to such imprudent
kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) next, that it must be declined.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was faithful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) word; and when Willoughby called at the
cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disappointment to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related,
and they were such as to make further entreaty on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) side impossible.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with
earnestness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) added, in the same low voice,—"But, Marianne, the horse
is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till
you can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment
in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you."

<p/>This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the
sentence, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) manner of pronouncing it, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
sister by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) Christian name alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) instantly saw an intimacy so
decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between
them. From that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) doubted not of their being engaged to each
other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), or
any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover
it by accident.

<p/>Margaret related something to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) the next day, which placed this
matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding
evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour
with only him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations,
which, with a most important face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) communicated to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eldest
sister, when they were next by themselves.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh, Elinor!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, "I have such a secret to tell you about
Marianne. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be married to Mr. Willoughby very soon."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have said so,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "almost every day since they first
met on High-church Down; and they had not known each other a week, I
believe, before you were certain that Marianne wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) picture round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) neck; but it turned out to be only the miniature of our great
uncle."

<p/>"But indeed this is quite another thing. I am sure they will be married
very soon, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) has got a lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hair."

<p/>"Take care, Margaret. It may be only the hair of some great uncle of
_his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)_."

<p/>"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne’s. I am almost sure it is, for I
saw him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of
the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could
be, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) seemed to be begging something of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>), and presently he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took
up her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) scissors and cut off a long lock of her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) hair, for it was all
tumbled down her (<font color='blue'><b>mama</b></font>) back; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of
white paper; and put it into his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) pocket-book."

<p/>For such particulars, stated on such authority, Elinor could not
withhold her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) credit; nor was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) disposed to it, for the circumstance
was in perfect unison with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard and seen herself.

<p/>Margaret’s sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) one evening at the park,
to give the name of the young man who was Elinor’s particular
favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
Margaret answered by looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sister, and saying, <div class="bookquote">"I must not
tell, may I, Elinor?"

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/>This of course made every body laugh; and Elinor tried to laugh too.
But the effort was painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that Margaret had fixed
on a person whose name she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) could not bear with composure to become a
standing joke with Mrs. Jennings.

<p/>Marianne felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) most sincerely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did more harm than good
to the cause, by turning very red and saying in an angry manner to
Margaret,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Remember that whatever your conjectures may be, you have no right to
repeat them."

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>"I never had any conjectures about it," replied Margaret; <div class="bookquote">"it was you
who told me of it yourself."

 (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div><p/>This increased the mirth of the company, and Margaret was eagerly
pressed to say something more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! pray, Miss Margaret, let us know all about it,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Jennings. "What is the gentleman’s name?"

<p/>"I must not tell, ma’am. But I know very well what it is; and I know
where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is too."

<p/>"Yes, yes, we can guess where he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is; at his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) own house at Norland to be
sure. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is the curate of the parish I dare say."

<p/>"No, _that_ he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is not. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is of no profession at all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Margaret,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne with great warmth, "you know that all this is
an invention of your own, and that there is no such person in
existence."

<p/>"Well, then, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) is lately dead, Marianne, for I am sure there was such
a man once, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name begins with an F.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this
moment, " (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>that it rained very hard," though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the
interruption to proceed less from any attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), than from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
ladyship’s great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as
delighted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband and mother. The idea however started by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was
immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion
mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of
rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked
Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of
different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so
easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a
very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a
brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not
be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders
on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir
John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be
a tolerable judge, for he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) had formed parties to visit them, at least,
twice every summer for the last ten years. They contained a noble piece
of water; a sail on which was to form a great part of the morning’s
amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be
employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete
party of pleasure.

<p/>To some few of the company it appeared rather a bold undertaking,
considering the time of year, and that it had rained every day for the
last fortnight;—and Mrs. Dashwood, who had already a cold, was
persuaded by Elinor to stay at home.
