<p/>Could Sir Thomas have seen all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece’s feelings, when she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) wrote her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
first letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) would not have despaired; for though a
good night’s rest, a pleasant morning, the hope of soon seeing William
again, and the comparatively quiet state of the house, from Tom and
Charles being gone to school, Sam on some project of his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) own, and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
father on his (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) usual lounges, enabled her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to express herself cheerfully
on the subject of home, there were still, to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) own perfect
consciousness, many drawbacks suppressed. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) have seen only half
that she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) felt before the end of a week, he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) would have thought Mr.
Crawford sure of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and been delighted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own sagacity.

<p/>Before the week ended, it was all disappointment. In the first place,
William was gone. The Thrush had had her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) orders, the wind had changed,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) was sailed within four days from their reaching Portsmouth; and
during those days she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) only twice, in a short and hurried
way, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thrush</b></font>) had come ashore on duty. There had been no free
conversation, no walk on the ramparts, no visit to the dockyard, no
acquaintance with the Thrush, nothing of all that they had planned and
depended on. Everything in that quarter failed her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), except William’s
affection. His (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) last thought on leaving home was for her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) stepped
back again to the door to say, "Take care of Fanny, mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
tender, and not used to rough it like the rest of us. I charge you,
take care of Fanny."

<p/>William was gone: and the home he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in was, Fanny could not
conceal it from herself, in almost every respect the very reverse of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have wished. It was the abode of noise, disorder, and
impropriety. Nobody was in their right place, nothing was done as it
ought to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hoped. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
father, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) confidence had not been sanguine, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was more negligent
of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) family, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) habits were worse, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) manners coarser, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had been prepared for. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not want abilities but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had no
curiosity, and no information beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) profession; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) read only the
newspaper and the navy-list; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) talked only of the dockyard, the
harbour, Spithead, and the Motherbank; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) swore and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) drank, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was
dirty and gross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never been able to recall anything approaching
to tenderness in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) former treatment of herself. There had remained
only a general impression of roughness and loudness; and now he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
scarcely ever noticed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), but to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the object of a coarse joke.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disappointment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother was greater: _there_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hoped
much, and found almost nothing. Every flattering scheme of being of
consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon fell to the ground. Mrs. Price was not unkind;
but, instead of gaining on her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) affection and confidence, and becoming
more and more dear, her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) daughter never met with greater kindness from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) than on the first day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) arrival. The instinct of nature was
soon satisfied, and Mrs. Price’s attachment had no other source. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>)
heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) time were already quite full; she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had neither leisure nor
affection to bestow on Fanny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) daughters never had been much to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sons, especially of William, but Betsey was the
first of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) girls whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) had ever much regarded. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was most
injudiciously indulgent. William was her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) pride; Betsey her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) darling; and
John, Richard, Sam, Tom, and Charles occupied all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
maternal solicitude, alternately her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) worries and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) comforts. These
shared her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) heart: her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) time was given chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) house and her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
servants. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) days were spent in a kind of slow bustle; all was busy
without getting on, always behindhand and lamenting it, without
altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) ways; wishing to be an economist, without contrivance or
regularity; dissatisfied with her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) servants, without skill to make them
better, and whether helping, or reprimanding, or indulging them,
without any power of engaging their respect.

<p/>Of her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) two sisters, Mrs. Price very much more resembled Lady Bertram
than Mrs. Norris. She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was a manager by necessity, without any of Mrs.
Norris’s inclination for it, or any of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) activity. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) disposition
was naturally easy and indolent, like Lady Bertram’s; and a situation
of similar affluence and do-nothingness would have been much more
suited to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) capacity than the exertions and self-denials of the one
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) imprudent marriage had placed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) in. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) might have made
just as good a woman of consequence as Lady Bertram, but Mrs. Norris
would have been a more respectable mother of nine children on a small
income.

<p/>Much of all this Fanny could not but be sensible of. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might scruple
to make use of the words, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must and did feel that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mother was
a partial, ill-judging parent, a dawdle, a slattern, who neither taught
nor restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) children, whose house was the scene of mismanagement
and discomfort from beginning to end, and who had no talent, no
conversation, no affection towards herself; no curiosity to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
better, no desire of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friendship, and no inclination for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) company
that could lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sense of such feelings.

<p/>Fanny was very anxious to be useful, and not to appear above her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home,
or in any way disqualified or disinclined, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) foreign education,
from contributing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) help to its comforts, and therefore set about
working for Sam immediately; and by working early and late, with
perseverance and great despatch, did so much that the boy was shipped
off at last, with more than half his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) linen ready. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had great
pleasure in feeling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usefulness, but could not conceive how they
would have managed without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Sam, loud and overbearing as he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rather regretted when he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) went,
for he (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>) was clever and intelligent, and glad to be employed in any
errand in the town; and though spurning the remonstrances of Susan,
given as they were, though very reasonable in themselves, with
ill-timed and powerless warmth, was beginning to be influenced by
Fanny’s services and gentle persuasions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found that the best of
the three younger ones was gone in him (<font color='blue'><b>Sam</b></font>): Tom and Charles being at least
as many years as they were his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) juniors distant from that age of feeling
and reason, which might suggest the expediency of making friends, and
of endeavouring to be less disagreeable. Their sister soon despaired of
making the smallest impression on _them_; they were quite untameable by
any means of address which she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had spirits or time to attempt. Every
afternoon brought a return of their riotous games all over the house;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very early learned to sigh at the approach of Saturday’s
constant half-holiday.

<p/>Betsey, too, a spoiled child, trained up to think the alphabet her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>)
greatest enemy, left to be with the servants at her (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) pleasure, and then
encouraged to report any evil of them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Betsey</b></font>) was almost as ready to
despair of being able to love or assist; and of Susan’s temper she (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) had
many doubts. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) continual disagreements with her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) rash
squabbles with Tom and Charles, and petulance with Betsey, were at
least so distressing to Fanny that, though admitting they were by no
means without provocation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feared the disposition that could push
them to such length must be far from amiable, and from affording any
repose to herself.

<p/>Such was the home which was to put Mansfield out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head, and teach
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund with moderated feelings. On the
contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of nothing but Mansfield, its beloved
inmates, its happy ways. Everything where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) now was in full contrast
to it. The elegance, propriety, regularity, harmony, and perhaps, above
all, the peace and tranquillity of Mansfield, were brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
remembrance every hour of the day, by the prevalence of everything
opposite to them _here_.

<p/>The living in incessant noise was, to a frame and temper delicate and
nervous like Fanny’s, an evil which no superadded elegance or harmony
could have entirely atoned for. It was the greatest misery of all. At
Mansfield, no sounds of contention, no raised voice, no abrupt bursts,
no tread of violence, was ever heard; all proceeded in a regular course
of cheerful orderliness; everybody had their due importance;
everybody’s feelings were consulted. If tenderness could be ever
supposed wanting, good sense and good breeding supplied its place; and
as to the little irritations sometimes introduced by aunt Norris, they
were short, they were trifling, they were as a drop of water to the
ocean, compared with the ceaseless tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) present abode. Here
everybody was noisy, every voice was loud (excepting, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
mother’s, which resembled the soft monotony of Lady Bertram’s, only
worn into fretfulness). Whatever was wanted was hallooed for, and the
servants hallooed out their excuses from the kitchen. The doors were in
constant banging, the stairs were never at rest, nothing was done
without a clatter, nobody sat still, and nobody could command attention
when they spoke.

<p/>In a review of the two houses, as they appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) before the end
of a week, Fanny was tempted to apply to them Dr. Johnson’s celebrated
judgment as to matrimony and celibacy, and say, that though Mansfield
Park might have some pains, Portsmouth could have no pleasures.
