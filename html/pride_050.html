<p/>Mr. Bennet had very often wished before this period of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) life
that, instead of spending his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) whole income, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had laid by an
annual sum for the better provision of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) children, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
wife, if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) survived him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) now wished it more than ever. Had
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) done his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) duty in that respect, Lydia need not have been
indebted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now
be purchased for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). The satisfaction of prevailing on one of
the most worthless young men in Great Britain to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband
might then have rested in its proper place.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to
anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>)
brother-in-law, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) was determined, if possible, to find out
the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) assistance, and to discharge the obligation as
soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) could.

<p/>When first Mr. Bennet had married, economy was held to be
perfectly useless, for, of course, they were to have a son. The
son was to join in cutting off the entail, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) should
be of age, and the widow and younger children would by that means
be provided for. Five daughters successively entered the world,
but yet the son was to come; and Mrs. Bennet, for many years
after Lydia’s birth, had been certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) would. This event
had at last been despaired of, but it was then too late to be
saving. Mrs. Bennet had no turn for economy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband’s
love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their
income.

<p/>Five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on Mrs.
Bennet and the children. But in what proportions it should be
divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents.
This was one point, with regard to Lydia, at least, which was now
to be settled, and Mr. Bennet could have no hesitation in
acceding to the proposal before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). In terms of grateful
acknowledgment for the kindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother, though expressed
most concisely, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) then delivered on paper his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) perfect
approbation of all that was done, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) willingness to fulfil
the engagements that had been made for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had never before
supposed that, could Wickham be prevailed on to marry his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
daughter, it would be done with so little inconvenience to
himself as by the present arrangement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would scarcely be ten
pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them;
for, what with her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) board and pocket allowance, and the continual
presents in money which passed to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) through her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother’s hands,
Lydia’s expenses had been very little within that sum.

<p/>That it would be done with such trifling exertion on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side,
too, was another very welcome surprise; for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wish at present
was to have as little trouble in the business as possible. When
the first transports of rage which had produced his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) activity in
seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) naturally returned to all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former
indolence. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) letter was soon dispatched; for, though dilatory
in undertaking business, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was quick in its execution. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) begged
to know further particulars of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was indebted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
brother, but was too angry with Lydia to send any message to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/>The good news spread quickly through the house, and with
proportionate speed through the neighbourhood. It was borne in
the latter with decent philosophy. To be sure, it would have been
more for the advantage of conversation had Miss Lydia Bennet come
upon the town; or, as the happiest alternative, been secluded
from the world, in some distant farmhouse. But there was much to
be talked of in marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>); and the good-natured wishes for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
well-doing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old
ladies in Meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this
change of circumstances, because with such an husband her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) misery
was considered certain.

<p/>It was a fortnight since Mrs. Bennet had been downstairs; but on
this happy day she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) again took her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seat at the head of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) table,
and in spirits oppressively high. No sentiment of shame gave a
damp to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) triumph. The marriage of a daughter, which had been
the first object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wishes since Jane was sixteen, was now on
the point of accomplishment, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thoughts and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) words ran
wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials, fine muslins, new
carriages, and servants. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was busily searching through the
neighbourhood for a proper situation for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and,
without knowing or considering what their income might be,
rejected many as deficient in size and importance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Haye Park might do,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), "if the Gouldings could quit
it—or the great house at Stoke, if the drawing-room were larger;
but Ashworth is too far off! I could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ten
miles from me; and as for Pulvis Lodge, the attics are dreadful."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to talk on without interruption while the
servants remained. But when they had withdrawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>):
"Mrs. Bennet, before you take any or all of these houses for your
son and daughter, let us come to a right understanding. Into
_one_ house in this neighbourhood they shall never have
admittance. I will not encourage the impudence of either, by
receiving them at Longbourn."

<p/>A long dispute followed this declaration; but Mr. Bennet was
firm. It soon led to another; and Mrs. Bennet found, with
amazement and horror, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband would not advance a guinea
to buy clothes for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter. He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) should
receive from him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) no mark of affection whatever on the occasion.
Mrs. Bennet could hardly comprehend it. That his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) anger could be
carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughter a privilege without which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) marriage would
scarcely seem valid, exceeded all she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) could believe possible. She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>)
was more alive to the disgrace which her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) want of new clothes must
reflect on her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) daughter’s nuptials, than to any sense of shame at
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) eloping and living with Wickham a fortnight before they took
place.

<p/>Elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had, from the
distress of the moment, been led to make Mr. Darcy acquainted
with their fears for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister; for since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) marriage would so
shortly give the proper termination to the elopement, they might
hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who
were not immediately on the spot.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no fear of its spreading farther through his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) means. There
were few people on whose secrecy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have more confidently
depended; but, at the same time, there was no one whose knowledge
of a sister’s frailty would have mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so much—not,
however, from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to
herself, for, at any rate, there seemed a gulf impassable between
them. Had Lydia’s marriage been concluded on the most honourable
terms, it was not to be supposed that Mr. Darcy would connect
himself with a family where, to every other objection, would now
be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a
man whom he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so justly scorned.

<p/>From such a connection she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would shrink.
The wish of procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) regard, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had assured herself
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feeling in Derbyshire, could not in rational expectation
survive such a blow as this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was humbled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was grieved;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) repented, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) hardly knew of what. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) became jealous
of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) esteem, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could no longer hope to be benefited by
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) wanted to hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when there seemed the least chance
of gaining intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could have
been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when it was no longer likely they should
meet.

<p/>What a triumph for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) often thought, could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) know that
the proposals which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had proudly spurned only four months ago,
would now have been most gladly and gratefully received! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was
as generous, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) doubted not, as the most generous of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sex;
but while he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was mortal, there must be a triumph.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) began now to comprehend that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was exactly the man who, in
disposition and talents, would most suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) understanding
and temper, though unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own, would have answered all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
wishes. It was an union that must have been to the advantage of
both; by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) ease and liveliness, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mind might have been
softened, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners improved; and from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) judgement,
information, and knowledge of the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) must have received
benefit of greater importance.

<p/>But no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude
what connubial felicity really was. An union of a different
tendency, and precluding the possibility of the other, was soon
to be formed in their family.

<p/>How Wickham and Lydia were to be supported in tolerable
independence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could not imagine. But how little of permanent
happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together
because their passions were stronger than their virtue, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) could
easily conjecture.

<p/>Mr. Gardiner soon wrote again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother. To Mr. Bennet’s
acknowledgments he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) briefly replied, with assurance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) family; and
concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be
mentioned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) again. The principal purport of his (<font color='blue'><b>principal</b></font>) letter was
to inform them that Mr. Wickham had resolved on quitting the
militia.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It was greatly my wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) should do so,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) added, "as soon
as his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) marriage was fixed on. And I think you will agree with me,
in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable,
both on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) account and my niece’s. It is Mr. Wickham’s intention
to go into the regulars; and among his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former friends, there are
still some who are able and willing to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) in the army. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
has the promise of an ensigncy in General ——’s regiment, now
quartered in the North. It is an advantage to have it so far from
this part of the kingdom. He (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) promises fairly; and I hope among
different people, where they may each have a character to
preserve, they will both be more prudent. I have written to
Colonel Forster, to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) of our present arrangements, and
to request that he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) will satisfy the various creditors of Mr.
Wickham in and near Brighton, with assurances of speedy payment,
for which I have pledged myself. And will you give yourself the
trouble of carrying similar assurances to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) creditors in
Meryton, of whom I shall subjoin a list according to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
information? He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has given in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) debts; I hope at least he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
has not deceived us. Haggerston has our directions, and all will
be completed in a week. They will then join his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regiment, unless
they are first invited to Longbourn; and I understand from Mrs.
Gardiner, that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) leaves the South. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) is well, and begs to be dutifully
remembered to you and her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mother.—Yours, etc.,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"E. GARDINER."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Bennet and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters saw all the advantages of Wickham’s
removal from the ——shire as clearly as Mr. Gardiner could do. But
Mrs. Bennet was not so well pleased with it. Lydia’s being
settled in the North, just when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had expected most pleasure
and pride in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) company, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had by no means given up her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
plan of their residing in Hertfordshire, was a severe
disappointment; and, besides, it was such a pity that Lydia
should be taken from a regiment where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was acquainted with
everybody, and had so many favourites.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is so fond of Mrs. Forster,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>), "it will be quite
shocking to send her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) away! And there are several of the young
men, too, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) likes very much. The officers may not be so
pleasant in General ——’s regiment."

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter’s request, for such it might be considered, of being
admitted into her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) family again before she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) set off for the North,
received at first an absolute negative. But Jane and Elizabeth,
who agreed in wishing, for the sake of their sister’s feelings
and consequence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) should be noticed on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) marriage by
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) parents, urged him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) so earnestly yet so rationally and so
mildly, to receive her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband at Longbourn, as soon as
they were married, that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) was prevailed on to think as they
thought, and act as they wished. And their mother had the
satisfaction of knowing that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would be able to show her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
married daughter in the neighbourhood before she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was banished to
the North. When Mr. Bennet wrote again to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother, therefore,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sent his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) permission for them to come; and it was settled, that
as soon as the ceremony was over, they should proceed to
Longbourn. Elizabeth was surprised, however, that Wickham should
consent to such a scheme, and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consulted only her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
inclination, any meeting with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) would have been the last object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes.
