<p/>Emma's very good opinion of Frank Churchill was a little shaken the following day, by hearing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was gone off to London, merely to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut. A sudden freak seemed to have seized him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at breakfast, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had sent for a chaise and set off, intending to return to dinner, but with no more important view that appeared than having his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hair cut. There was certainly no harm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) travelling sixteen miles twice over on such an errand; but there was an air of foppery and nonsense in it which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not approve. It did not accord with the rationality of plan, the moderation in expense, or even the unselfish warmth of heart, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had believed herself to discern in him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) yesterday. Vanity, extravagance, love of change, restlessness of temper, which must be doing something, good or bad; heedlessness as to the pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father and Mrs. Weston, indifferent as to how his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conduct might appear in general; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) became liable to all these charges. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father only called him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) a coxcomb, and thought it a very good story; but that Mrs. Weston did not like it, was clear enough, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) passing it over as quickly as possible, and making no other comment than that <div class="bookquote">"all young people would have their little whims."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>With the exception of this little blot, Emma found that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) visit hitherto had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend only good ideas of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Mrs. Weston was very ready to say how attentive and pleasant a companion he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) made himself how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw to like in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) disposition altogether. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) appeared to have a very open temper certainly a very cheerful and lively one; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could observe nothing wrong in his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) notions, a great deal decidedly right; he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) uncle with warm regard, was fond of talking of him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would be the best man in the world if he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) were left to himself; and though there was no being attached to the aunt, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) acknowledged her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) kindness with gratitude, and seemed to mean always to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with respect. This was all very promising; and, but for such an unfortunate fancy for having his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) hair cut, there was nothing to denote him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) unworthy of the distinguished honour which her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) imagination had given him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>); the honour, if not of being really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>), of being at least very near it, and saved only by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) own indifference (for still her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolution held of never marrying) the honour, in short, of being marked out for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) by all their joint acquaintance.

<p/>Mr. Weston, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) side, added a virtue to the account which must have some weight. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to understand that Frank admired her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) extremely thought her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) very beautiful and very charming; and with so much to be said for him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) must not judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) harshly. As Mrs. Weston observed, <div class="bookquote">"all young people would have their little whims."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>There was one person among his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) new acquaintance in Surry, not so leniently disposed. In general he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was judged, throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury, with great candour; liberal allowances were made for the little excesses of such a handsome young man one who smiled so often and bowed so well; but there was one spirit among them not to be softened, from its power of censure, by bows or smiles Mr. Knightley. The circumstance was told him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at Hartfield; for the moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent; but Emma heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) almost immediately afterwards say to himself, over a newspaper he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) held in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) hand, "Hum! just the trifling, silly fellow I took him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for." She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had half a mind to resent; but an instant's observation convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that it was really said only to relieve his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own feelings, and not meant to provoke; and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass.

<p/>Although in one instance the bearers of not good tidings, Mr. and Mrs. Weston's visit this morning was in another respect particularly opportune. Something occurred while they were at Hartfield, to make Emma want their advice; and, which was still more lucky, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted exactly the advice they gave.

<p/>This was the occurrence: The Coles had been settled some years in Highbury, and were very good sort of people friendly, liberal, and unpretending; but, on the other hand, they were of low origin, in trade, and only moderately genteel. On their first coming into the country, they had lived in proportion to their income, quietly, keeping little company, and that little unexpensively; but the last year or two had brought them a considerable increase of means the house in town had yielded greater profits, and fortune in general had smiled on them. With their wealth, their views increased; their want of a larger house, their inclination for more company. They added to their house, to their number of servants, to their expenses of every sort; and by this time were, in fortune and style of living, second only to the family at Hartfield. Their love of society, and their new dining-room, prepared every body for their keeping dinner-company; and a few parties, chiefly among the single men, had already taken place. The regular and best families Emma could hardly suppose they would presume to invite neither Donwell, nor Hartfield, nor Randalls. Nothing should tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) to go, if they did; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) regretted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father's known habits would be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) refusal less meaning than she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) could wish. The Coles were very respectable in their way, but they ought to be taught that it was not for them to arrange the terms on which the superior families would visit them. This lesson, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) very much feared, they would receive only from herself; she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had little hope of Mr. Knightley, none of Mr. Weston.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had made up her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) mind how to meet this presumption so many weeks before it appeared, that when the insult came at last, it found her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) very differently affected. Donwell and Randalls had received their invitation, and none had come for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father and herself; and Mrs. Weston's accounting for it with <div class="bookquote">"I suppose they will not take the liberty with you; they know you do not dine out,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>was not quite sufficient. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should like to have had the power of refusal; and afterwards, as the idea of the party to be assembled there, consisting precisely of those whose society was dearest to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), occurred again and again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not have been tempted to accept. Harriet was to be there in the evening, and the Bateses. They had been speaking of it as they walked about Highbury the day before, and Frank Churchill had most earnestly lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence. Might not the evening end in a dance? had been a question of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). The bare possibility of it acted as a farther irritation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) spirits; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being left in solitary grandeur, even supposing the omission to be intended as a compliment, was but poor comfort.

<p/>It was the arrival of this very invitation while the Westons were at Hartfield, which made their presence so acceptable; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first remark, on reading it, was that <div class="bookquote">"of course it must be declined,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so very soon proceeded to ask them what they advised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to do, that their advice for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) going was most prompt and successful.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) owned that, considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not absolutely without inclination for the party. The Coles expressed themselves so properly there was so much real attention in the manner of it so much consideration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. <div class="bookquote">"They would have solicited the honour earlier, but had been waiting the arrival of a folding-screen from London, which they hoped might keep Mr. Woodhouse from any draught of air, and therefore induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the more readily to give them the honour of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) company."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Upon the whole, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was very persuadable; and it being briefly settled among themselves how it might be done without neglecting his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) comfort how certainly Mrs. Goddard, if not Mrs. Bates, might be depended on for bearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) company Mr. Woodhouse was to be talked into an acquiescence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's going out to dinner on a day now near at hand, and spending the whole evening away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). As for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) going, Emma did not wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to think it possible, the hours would be too late, and the party too numerous. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was soon pretty well resigned.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am not fond of dinner-visiting,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) "I never was. No more is Emma. Late hours do not agree with us. I am sorry Mr. and Mrs. Cole should have done it. I think it would be much better if they would come in one afternoon next summer, and take their tea with us take us in their afternoon walk; which they might do, as our hours are so reasonable, and yet get home without being out in the damp of the evening. The dews of a summer evening are what I would not expose any body to. However, as they are so very desirous to have dear Emma dine with them, and as you will both be there, and Mr. Knightley too, to take care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), I cannot wish to prevent it, provided the weather be what it ought, neither damp, nor cold, nor windy.<div class="bookquote">" Then turning to Mrs. Weston, with a look of gentle reproach " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Taylor</b></font>)</div>Ah! Miss Taylor, if you had not married, you would have staid at home with me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston, "as I took Miss Taylor away, it is incumbent on me to supply her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) place, if I can; and I will step to Mrs. Goddard in a moment, if you wish it."

<p/>But the idea of any thing to be done in a moment, was increasing, not lessening, Mr. Woodhouse's agitation. The ladies knew better how to allay it. Mr. Weston must be quiet, and every thing deliberately arranged.

<p/>With this treatment, Mr. Woodhouse was soon composed enough for talking as usual. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should be happy to see Mrs. Goddard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had a great regard for Mrs. Goddard; and Emma should write a line, and invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). James could take the note. But first of all, there must be an answer written to Mrs. Cole."

<p/>"You will make my excuses, my dear, as civilly as possible. You will say that I am quite an invalid, and go no where, and therefore must decline their obliging invitation; beginning with my compliments, of course. But you will do every thing right. I need not tell you what is to be done. We must remember to let James know that the carriage will be wanted on Tuesday. I shall have no fears for you with him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>). We have never been there above once since the new approach was made; but still I have no doubt that James will take you very safely. And when you get there, you must tell him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) at what time you would have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) come for you again; and you had better name an early hour. You will not like staying late. You will get very tired when tea is over."

<p/>"But you would not wish me to come away before I am tired, papa?"

<p/>"Oh! no, my love; but you will soon be tired. There will be a great many people talking at once. You will not like the noise."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But, my dear sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston, "if Emma comes away early, it will be breaking up the party."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And no great harm if it does,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse. "The sooner every party breaks up, the better."

<p/>"But you do not consider how it may appear to the Coles. Emma's going away directly after tea might be giving offence. They are good-natured people, and think little of their own claims; but still they must feel that any body's hurrying away is no great compliment; and Miss Woodhouse's doing it would be more thought of than any other person's in the room. You would not wish to disappoint and mortify the Coles, I am sure, sir; friendly, good sort of people as ever lived, and who have been your neighbours these ten years."

<p/>"No, upon no account in the world, Mr. Weston; I am much obliged to you for reminding me. I should be extremely sorry to be giving them any pain. I know what worthy people they are. Perry tells me that Mr. Cole never touches malt liquor. You would not think it to look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) is bilious Mr. Cole is very bilious. No, I would not be the means of giving them any pain. My dear Emma, we must consider this. I am sure, rather than run the risk of hurting Mr. and Mrs. Cole, you would stay a little longer than you might wish. You will not regard being tired. You will be perfectly safe, you know, among your friends."

<p/>"Oh yes, papa. I have no fears at all for myself; and I should have no scruples of staying as late as Mrs. Weston, but on your account. I am only afraid of your sitting up for me. I am not afraid of your not being exceedingly comfortable with Mrs. Goddard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) loves piquet, you know; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) is gone home, I am afraid you will be sitting up by yourself, instead of going to bed at your usual time and the idea of that would entirely destroy my comfort. You must promise me not to sit up."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>) did, on the condition of some promises on her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) side: such as that, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) came home cold, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would be sure to warm herself thoroughly; if hungry, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would take something to eat; that her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) own maid should sit up for her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>); and that Serle and the butler should see that every thing were safe in the house, as usual.
