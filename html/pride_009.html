<p/>Elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s room, and
in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable
answer to the enquiries which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) very early received from Mr.
Bingley by a housemaid, and some time afterwards from the two
elegant ladies who waited on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters. In spite of this
amendment, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) requested to have a note sent to
Longbourn, desiring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother to visit Jane, and form her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
judgement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation. The note was immediately dispatched,
and its contents as quickly complied with. Mrs. Bennet,
accompanied by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) two youngest girls, reached Netherfield soon
after the family breakfast.

<p/>Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) found Jane in any apparent danger, Mrs. Bennet would have
been very miserable; but being satisfied on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
illness was not alarming, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had no wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) recovering
immediately, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) restoration to health would probably remove
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) from Netherfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would not listen, therefore, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
daughter’s proposal of being carried home; neither did the
apothecary, who arrived about the same time, think it at all
advisable. After sitting a little while with Jane, on Miss
Bingley’s appearance and invitation, the mother and three
daughters all attended her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) into the breakfast parlour. Bingley
met them with hopes that Mrs. Bennet had not found Miss Bennet
worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) expected.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed I have, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) answer. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is a great deal too
ill to be moved. Mr. Jones says we must not think of moving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>).
We must trespass a little longer on your kindness."

<p/>"Removed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Bingley. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It must not be thought of. My sister,
I am sure, will not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) removal."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may depend upon it, Madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Bingley/Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, with cold
civility, "that Miss Bennet will receive every possible attention
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) remains with us.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was profuse in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) acknowledgments.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am sure," she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, "if it was not for such good friends I do
not know what would become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is very ill indeed,
and suffers a vast deal, though with the greatest patience in the
world, which is always the way with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), for she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has, without
exception, the sweetest temper I have ever met with. I often tell
my other girls they are nothing to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)_. You have a sweet room
here, Mr. Bingley, and a charming prospect over the gravel walk.
I do not know a place in the country that is equal to
Netherfield. You will not think of quitting it in a hurry, I
hope, though you have but a short lease."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Whatever I do is done in a hurry,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); "and therefore if
I should resolve to quit Netherfield, I should probably be off in
five minutes. At present, however, I consider myself as quite
fixed here."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is exactly what I should have supposed of you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth.

<p/>"You begin to comprehend me, do you?<div class="bookquote">" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), turning towards
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! yes—I understand you perfectly."

<p/>"I wish I might take this for a compliment; but to be so easily
seen through I am afraid is pitiful."

<p/>"That is as it happens. It does not follow that a deep, intricate
character is more or less estimable than such a one as yours."

<p/>"Lizzy,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) mother, " (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>remember where you are, and do not
run on in the wild manner that you are suffered to do at home."

<p/>"I did not know before,<div class="bookquote">" continued Bingley immediately, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that you
were a studier of character. It must be an amusing study."

<p/>"Yes, but intricate characters are the _most_ amusing. They have
at least that advantage."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The country,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, "can in general supply but a few
subjects for such a study. In a country neighbourhood you move in
a very confined and unvarying society."

<p/>"But people themselves alter so much, that there is something new
to be observed in them for ever."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bennet, offended by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manner of
mentioning a country neighbourhood. "I assure you there is quite
as much of _that_ going on in the country as in town."

<p/>Everybody was surprised, and Darcy, after looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) for a
moment, turned silently away. Mrs. Bennet, who fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had
gained a complete victory over him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) triumph.

<p/>"I cannot see that London has any great advantage over the
country, for my part, except the shops and public places. The
country is a vast deal pleasanter, is it not, Mr. Bingley?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When I am in the country,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) replied, "I never wish to leave
it; and when I am in town it is pretty much the same. They have
each their advantages, and I can be equally happy in either."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Aye—that is because you have the right disposition. But that
gentleman,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>looking at Darcy, "seemed to think the country was
nothing at all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed, Mamma, you are mistaken,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, blushing for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother. "You quite mistook Mr. Darcy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only meant that
there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the
country as in the town, which you must acknowledge to be true."

<p/>"Certainly, my dear, nobody said there were; but as to not
meeting with many people in this neighbourhood, I believe there
are few neighbourhoods larger. I know we dine with
four-and-twenty families."

<p/>Nothing but concern for Elizabeth could enable Bingley to keep
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) countenance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister was less delicate, and directed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
eyes towards Mr. Darcy with a very expressive smile. Elizabeth,
for the sake of saying something that might turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s
thoughts, now asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) if Charlotte Lucas had been at Longbourn
since _her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)_ coming away.

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) called yesterday with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father. What an agreeable man
Sir William is, Mr. Bingley, is not he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)? So much the man of
fashion! So genteel and easy! He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has always something to say to
everybody. _That_ is my idea of good breeding; and those persons
who fancy themselves very important, and never open their mouths,
quite mistake the matter."

<p/>"Did Charlotte dine with you?"

<p/>"No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would go home. I fancy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was wanted about the
mince-pies. For my part, Mr. Bingley, _I_ always keep servants
that can do their own work; _my_ daughters are brought up very
differently. But everybody is to judge for themselves, and the
Lucases are a very good sort of girls, I assure you. It is a pity
they are not handsome! Not that _I_ think Charlotte so _very_
plain—but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is our particular friend."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) seems a very pleasant young woman."

<p/>"Oh! dear, yes; but you must own she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is very plain. Lady Lucas
herself has often said so, and envied me Jane’s beauty. I do not
like to boast of my own child, but to be sure, Jane—one does not
often see anybody better looking. It is what everybody says. I do
not trust my own partiality. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was only fifteen, there was
a man at my brother Gardiner’s in town so much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
that my sister-in-law was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) an offer before
we came away. But, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) did not. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
too young. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) wrote some verses on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and very pretty
they were."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And so ended his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) affection,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth impatiently. "There
has been many a one, I fancy, overcome in the same way. I wonder
who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away
love!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have been used to consider poetry as the _food_ of love,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>said
Darcy.

<p/>"Of a fine, stout, healthy love it may. Everything nourishes what
is strong already. But if it be only a slight, thin sort of
inclination, I am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it
entirely away."

<p/>Darcy only smiled; and the general pause which ensued made
Elizabeth tremble lest her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother should be exposing herself
again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to speak, but could think of nothing to say;
and after a short silence Mrs. Bennet began repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thanks
to Mr. Bingley for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) kindness to Jane, with an apology for
troubling him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) also with Lizzy. Mr. Bingley was unaffectedly civil
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) answer, and forced his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) younger sister to be civil also,
and say what the occasion required. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) part indeed
without much graciousness, but Mrs. Bennet was satisfied, and
soon afterwards ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) carriage. Upon this signal, the
youngest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters put herself forward. The two girls had
been whispering to each other during the whole visit, and the
result of it was, that the youngest should tax Mr. Bingley with
having promised on his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) first coming into the country to give a
ball at Netherfield.

<p/>Lydia was a stout, well-grown girl of fifteen, with a fine
complexion and good-humoured countenance; a favourite with her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>)
mother, whose affection had brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) into public at an early
age. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had high animal spirits, and a sort of natural
self-consequence, which the attention of the officers, to whom
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) uncle’s good dinners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) own easy manners recommended
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), had increased into assurance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was very equal, therefore,
to address Mr. Bingley on the subject of the ball, and abruptly
reminded him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) promise; adding, that it would be the most
shameful thing in the world if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did not keep it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) answer to
this sudden attack was delightful to their mother’s ear:

<p/>"I am perfectly ready, I assure you, to keep my engagement; and
when your sister is recovered, you shall, if you please, name the
very day of the ball. But you would not wish to be dancing when
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is ill.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lydia declared herself satisfied. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! yes—it would be much
better to wait till Jane was well, and by that time most likely
Captain Carter would be at Meryton again. And when you have given
_your_ ball," she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) added, "I shall insist on their giving one
also. I shall tell Colonel Forster it will be quite a shame if he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
does not."

<p/>Mrs. Bennet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters then departed, and Elizabeth
returned instantly to Jane, leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations’
behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and Mr. Darcy; the
latter of whom, however, could not be prevailed on to join in
their censure of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_, in spite of all Miss Bingley’s witticisms
on _fine eyes_.
