<p/>Elinor, for some time after he (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), for some time even after the
sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) carriage had died away, remained too much oppressed by a
crowd of ideas, widely differing in themselves, but of which sadness
was the general result, to think even of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Willoughby, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), whom only half an hour ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had abhorred as the most
worthless of men, Willoughby, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) faults, excited a
degree of commiseration for the sufferings produced by them, which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) as now separated for ever from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family, with a
tenderness, a regret, rather in proportion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon acknowledged
within herself—to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) wishes than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) merits. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
influence over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was heightened by circumstances which ought not
in reason to have weight; by that person of uncommon attraction, that
open, affectionate, and lively manner which it was no merit to possess;
and by that still ardent love for Marianne, which it was not even
innocent to indulge. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt that it was so, long, long before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
could feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) influence less.

<p/>When at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) returned to the unconscious Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
just awaking, refreshed by so long and sweet a sleep to the extent of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hopes. Elinor’s heart was full. The past, the present, the future,
Willoughby’s visit, Marianne’s safety, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother’s expected
arrival, threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) altogether into an agitation of spirits which kept
off every indication of fatigue, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only fearful of betraying
herself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister. Short was the time, however, in which that fear
could affect her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), for within half an hour after Willoughby’s leaving
the house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was again called down stairs by the sound of another
carriage.—Eager to save her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother from every unnecessary moment’s
horrible suspense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ran immediately into the hall, and reached the
outward door just in time to receive and support her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered it.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, whose terror as they drew near the house had produced
almost the conviction of Marianne’s being no more, had no voice to
inquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), no voice even for Elinor; but _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_, waiting neither
for salutation nor inquiry, instantly gave the joyful relief; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, catching it with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) usual warmth, was in a moment as much
overcome by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) happiness, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been before by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fears. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
supported into the drawing-room between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) daughter and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend;
and there, shedding tears of joy, though still unable to speak,
embraced Elinor again and again, turning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) at intervals to press
Colonel Brandon’s hand, with a look which spoke at once her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) gratitude,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) sharing with herself in the bliss of the
moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) shared it, however, in a silence even greater than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>As soon as Mrs. Dashwood had recovered herself, to see Marianne was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
first desire; and in two minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) beloved child,
rendered dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever by absence, unhappiness, and danger.
Elinor’s delight, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw what each felt in the meeting, was only
checked by an apprehension of its robbing Marianne of farther sleep:
but Mrs. Dashwood could be calm, could be even prudent, when the life
of a child was at stake, and Marianne, satisfied in knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother
was near her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and conscious of being too weak for conversation,
submitted readily to the silence and quiet prescribed by every nurse
around her (<font color='blue'><b>nurse</b></font>). Mrs. Dashwood _would_ sit up with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) all night; and
Elinor, in compliance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s entreaty, went to bed. But the
rest, which one night entirely sleepless, and many hours of the most
wearing anxiety seemed to make requisite, was kept off by irritation of
spirits. Willoughby, <div class="bookquote">"poor Willoughby,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)</div>as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now allowed herself to
call him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), was constantly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not but have heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) vindication for the world, and now blamed, now acquitted herself
for having judged him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) so harshly before. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) promise of relating it
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was invariably painful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) dreaded the performance of
it, dreaded what its effect on Marianne might be; doubted whether after
such an explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could ever be happy with another; and for a
moment wished Willoughby a widower. Then, remembering Colonel Brandon,
reproved herself, felt that to _his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)_ sufferings and _his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)_ constancy far
more than to his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) rival’s, the reward of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister was due, and wished
any thing rather than Mrs. Willoughby’s death.

<p/>The shock of Colonel Brandon’s errand at Barton had been much softened
to Mrs. Dashwood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own previous alarm; for so great was her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
uneasiness about Marianne, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had already determined to set out
for Cleveland on that very day, without waiting for any further
intelligence, and had so far settled her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey before his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) arrival,
that the Careys were then expected every moment to fetch Margaret away,
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother was unwilling to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) where there might be infection.

<p/>Marianne continued to mend every day, and the brilliant cheerfulness of
Mrs. Dashwood’s looks and spirits proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to be, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) repeatedly
declared herself, one of the happiest women in the world. Elinor could
not hear the declaration, nor witness its proofs without sometimes
wondering whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother ever recollected Edward. But Mrs.
Dashwood, trusting to the temperate account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own disappointment
which Elinor had sent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was led away by the exuberance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) joy to
think only of what would increase it. Marianne was restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from
a danger in which, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) now began to feel, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own mistaken judgment
in encouraging the unfortunate attachment to Willoughby, had
contributed to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);—and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovery she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had yet another
source of joy unthought of by Elinor. It was thus imparted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), as
soon as any opportunity of private conference between them occurred.

<p/>"At last we are alone. My Elinor, you do not yet know all my happiness.
Colonel Brandon loves Marianne. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has told me so himself.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter, feeling by turns both pleased and pained, surprised and
not surprised, was all silent attention.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You are never like me, dear Elinor, or I should wonder at your
composure now. Had I sat down to wish for any possible good to my
family, I should have fixed on Colonel Brandon’s marrying one of you as
the object most desirable. And I believe Marianne will be the most
happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) of the two.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor was half inclined to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason for thinking so, because
satisfied that none founded on an impartial consideration of their age,
characters, or feelings, could be given;—but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother must always be
carried away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) imagination on any interesting subject, and
therefore instead of an inquiry, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) passed it off with a smile.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) whole heart to me yesterday as we travelled. It came out
quite unawares, quite undesignedly. I, you may well believe, could talk
of nothing but my child;—he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) distress; I saw that
it equalled my own, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) perhaps, thinking that mere friendship, as
the world now goes, would not justify so warm a sympathy—or rather, not
thinking at all, I suppose—giving way to irresistible feelings, made me
acquainted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) earnest, tender, constant, affection for Marianne.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) has loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), my Elinor, ever since the first moment of seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here, however, Elinor perceived,—not the language, not the professions
of Colonel Brandon, but the natural embellishments of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s
active fancy, which fashioned every thing delightful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as it
chose.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), infinitely surpassing anything that Willoughby
ever felt or feigned, as much more warm, as more sincere or
constant—which ever we are to call it—has subsisted through all the
knowledge of dear Marianne’s unhappy prepossession for that worthless
young man!—and without selfishness—without encouraging a hope!—could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) happy with another—Such a noble mind!—such openness, such
sincerity!—no one can be deceived in _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Colonel Brandon’s character,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "as an excellent man, is
well established."

<p/>"I know it is,<div class="bookquote">"—replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother seriously, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>or after such a warning,
_I_ should be the last to encourage such affection, or even to be
pleased by it. But his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming for me as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did, with such active, such
ready friendship, is enough to prove him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) one of the worthiest of men."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, however,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, "does not rest on _one_ act
of kindness, to which his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection for Marianne, were humanity out of
the case, would have prompted him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). To Mrs. Jennings, to the Middletons,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been long and intimately known; they equally love and respect
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and even my own knowledge of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), though lately acquired, is very
considerable; and so highly do _I_ value and esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that if
Marianne can be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), I shall be as ready as yourself to
think our connection the greatest blessing to us in the world. What
answer did you give him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?—Did you allow him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to hope?"

<p/>"Oh! my love, I could not then talk of hope to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) or to myself.
Marianne might at that moment be dying. But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not ask for hope or
encouragement. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was an involuntary confidence, an irrepressible
effusion to a soothing friend, not an application to a parent. Yet
after a time I _did_ say, for at first I was quite overcome, that if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lived, as I trusted she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might, my greatest happiness would lie in
promoting their marriage; and since our arrival, since our delightful
security, I have repeated it to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more fully, have given him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) every
encouragement in my power. Time, a very little time, I tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), will
do everything; Marianne’s heart is not to be wasted for ever on such a
man as Willoughby. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own merits must soon secure it."

<p/>"To judge from the Colonel’s spirits, however, you have not yet made
him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) equally sanguine."

<p/>"No. He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) thinks Marianne’s affection too deeply rooted for any change in
it under a great length of time, and even supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart again
free, is too diffident of himself to believe, that with such a
difference of age and disposition he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) could ever attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). There,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is quite mistaken. His (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) age is only so much beyond hers as
to be an advantage, as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) character and principles fixed; and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) disposition, I am well convinced, is exactly the very one to make
your sister happy. And his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) person, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) manners too, are all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
favour. My partiality does not blind me; he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) certainly is not so
handsome as Willoughby; but at the same time, there is something much
more pleasing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance. There was always a something, if you
remember, in Willoughby’s eyes at times, which I did not like."

<p/>Elinor could _not_ remember it; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, without waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
assent, continued,

<p/>"And his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manners, the Colonel’s manners are not only more pleasing to
me than Willoughby’s ever were, but they are of a kind I well know to
be more solidly attaching to Marianne. Their gentleness, their genuine
attention to other people, and their manly unstudied simplicity is much
more accordant with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) real disposition, than the liveliness, often
artificial, and often ill-timed of the other. I am very sure myself,
that had Willoughby turned out as really amiable, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has proved
himself the contrary, Marianne would yet never have been so happy with
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)_ as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be with Colonel Brandon."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) paused.—Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter could not quite agree with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
dissent was not heard, and therefore gave no offence.

<p/>"At Delaford, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will be within an easy distance of me," added Mrs.
Dashwood, <div class="bookquote">"even if I remain at Barton; and in all probability,—for I
hear it is a large village,—indeed there certainly _must_ be some small
house or cottage close by, that would suit us quite as well as our
present situation."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Poor Elinor!—here was a new scheme for getting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to Delaford!—but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
spirit was stubborn.

<p/>"His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) fortune too!—for at my time of life you know, everybody cares
about _that;_—and though I neither know nor desire to know, what it
really is, I am sure it must be a good one."

<p/>Here they were interrupted by the entrance of a third person, and
Elinor withdrew to think it all over in private, to wish success to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
friend, and yet in wishing it, to feel a pang for Willoughby.
