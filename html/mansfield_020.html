<p/>Edmund’s first object the next morning was to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) father alone, and
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) a fair statement of the whole acting scheme, defending his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own
share in it as far only as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could then, in a soberer moment, feel his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
motives to deserve, and acknowledging, with perfect ingenuousness, that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) concession had been attended with such partial good as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
judgment in it very doubtful. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was anxious, while vindicating
himself, to say nothing unkind of the others: but there was only one
amongst them whose conduct he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could mention without some necessity of
defence or palliation. <div class="bookquote">"We have all been more or less to blame,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), "every one of us, excepting Fanny. Fanny is the only one who has
judged rightly throughout; who has been consistent. _Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ feelings have
been steadily against it from first to last. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never ceased to think
of what was due to you. You will find Fanny everything you could wish."

<p/>Sir Thomas saw all the impropriety of such a scheme among such a party,
and at such a time, as strongly as his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) son had ever supposed he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must;
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) felt it too much, indeed, for many words; and having shaken hands
with Edmund, meant to try to lose the disagreeable impression, and
forget how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been forgotten himself as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could,
after the house had been cleared of every object enforcing the
remembrance, and restored to its proper state. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not enter into
any remonstrance with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) other children: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was more willing to
believe they felt their error than to run the risk of investigation.
The reproof of an immediate conclusion of everything, the sweep of
every preparation, would be sufficient.

<p/>There was one person, however, in the house, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not leave to
learn his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sentiments merely through his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) conduct. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could not help
giving Mrs. Norris a hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) having hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) advice might
have been interposed to prevent what her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) judgment must certainly have
disapproved. The young people had been very inconsiderate in forming
the plan; they ought to have been capable of a better decision
themselves; but they were young; and, excepting Edmund, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) believed, of
unsteady characters; and with greater surprise, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) must
regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) acquiescence in their wrong measures, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) countenance of
their unsafe amusements, than that such measures and such amusements
should have been suggested. Mrs. Norris was a little confounded and as
nearly being silenced as ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) life; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was
ashamed to confess having never seen any of the impropriety which was
so glaring to Sir Thomas, and would not have admitted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
influence was insufficient—that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) might have talked in vain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) only
resource was to get out of the subject as fast as possible, and turn
the current of Sir Thomas’s ideas into a happier channel. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had a
great deal to insinuate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own praise as to _general_ attention to
the interest and comfort of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, much exertion and many
sacrifices to glance at in the form of hurried walks and sudden
removals from her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own fireside, and many excellent hints of distrust
and economy to Lady Bertram and Edmund to detail, whereby a most
considerable saving had always arisen, and more than one bad servant
been detected. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) chief strength lay in Sotherton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) greatest
support and glory was in having formed the connexion with the
Rushworths. _There_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was impregnable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) took to herself all the
credit of bringing Mr. Rushworth’s admiration of Maria to any effect.
<div class="bookquote">"If I had not been active,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), "and made a point of being
introduced to his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) mother, and then prevailed on my sister to pay the
first visit, I am as certain as I sit here that nothing would have come
of it; for Mr. Rushworth is the sort of amiable modest young man who
wants a great deal of encouragement, and there were girls enough on the
catch for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) if we had been idle. But I left no stone unturned. I was
ready to move heaven and earth to persuade my sister, and at last I did
persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). You know the distance to Sotherton; it was in the middle
of winter, and the roads almost impassable, but I did persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know how great, how justly great, your influence is with Lady
Bertram and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) children, and am the more concerned that it should not
have been—"

 (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div><p/>"My dear Sir Thomas, if you had seen the state of the roads _that_ day!
I thought we should never have got through them, though we had the four
horses of course; and poor old coachman would attend us, out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
great love and kindness, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was hardly able to sit the box on
account of the rheumatism which I had been doctoring him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) for ever since
Michaelmas. I cured him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) at last; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was very bad all the winter—and
this was such a day, I could not help going to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) room
before we set off to advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) not to venture: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was putting on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
wig; so I said, <div class="bookquote">‘Coachman, you had much better not go; your Lady and I
shall be very safe; you know how steady Stephen is, and Charles has
been upon the leaders so often now, that I am sure there is no fear.’
 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But, however, I soon found it would not do; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was bent upon going, and
as I hate to be worrying and officious, I said no more; but my heart
quite ached for him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) at every jolt, and when we got into the rough lanes
about Stoke, where, what with frost and snow upon beds of stones, it
was worse than anything you can imagine, I was quite in an agony about
him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). And then the poor horses too! To see them straining away! You know
how I always feel for the horses. And when we got to the bottom of
Sandcroft Hill, what do you think I did? You will laugh at me; but I
got out and walked up. I did indeed. It might not be saving them much,
but it was something, and I could not bear to sit at my ease and be
dragged up at the expense of those noble animals. I caught a dreadful
cold, but _that_ I did not regard. My object was accomplished in the
visit."

<p/>"I hope we shall always think the acquaintance worth any trouble that
might be taken to establish it. There is nothing very striking in Mr.
Rushworth’s manners, but I was pleased last night with what appeared to
be his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) opinion on one subject: his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) decided preference of a quiet family
party to the bustle and confusion of acting. He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) seemed to feel exactly
as one could wish."

<p/>"Yes, indeed, and the more you know of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the better you will like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is not a shining character, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) has a thousand good
qualities; and is so disposed to look up to you, that I am quite
laughed at about it, for everybody considers it as my doing. <div class="bookquote">‘Upon my
word, Mrs. Norris,’  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Grant the other day, <div class="bookquote">‘if Mr. Rushworth
were a son of your own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) could not hold Sir Thomas in greater
respect.’ (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>Sir Thomas gave up the point, foiled by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) evasions, disarmed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
flattery; and was obliged to rest satisfied with the conviction that
where the present pleasure of those she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) loved was at stake, her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
kindness did sometimes overpower her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) judgment.

<p/>It was a busy morning with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). Conversation with any of them occupied
but a small part of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had to reinstate himself in all the wonted
concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) Mansfield life: to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) steward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) bailiff; to
examine and compute, and, in the intervals of business, to walk into
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stables and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) gardens, and nearest plantations; but active and
methodical, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had not only done all this before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) resumed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) seat as
master of the house at dinner, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had also set the carpenter to work in
pulling down what had been so lately put up in the billiard-room, and
given the scene-painter his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) dismissal long enough to justify the
pleasing belief of his (<font color='blue'><b>painter</b></font>) being then at least as far off as Northampton.
The scene-painter was gone, having spoilt only the floor of one room,
ruined all the coachman’s sponges, and made five of the under-servants
idle and dissatisfied; and Sir Thomas was in hopes that another day or
two would suffice to wipe away every outward memento of what had been,
even to the destruction of every unbound copy of Lovers’ Vows in the
house, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was burning all that met his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Mr. Yates was beginning now to understand Sir Thomas’s intentions,
though as far as ever from understanding their source. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
friend had been out with their guns the chief of the morning, and Tom
had taken the opportunity of explaining, with proper apologies for his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
father’s particularity, what was to be expected. Mr. Yates felt it as
acutely as might be supposed. To be a second time disappointed in the
same way was an instance of very severe ill-luck; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) indignation
was such, that had it not been for delicacy towards his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) friend, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
friend’s youngest sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) should certainly attack the
baronet on the absurdity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) proceedings, and argue him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) into a
little more rationality. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) believed this very stoutly while he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was in
Mansfield Wood, and all the way home; but there was a something in Sir
Thomas, when they sat round the same table, which made Mr. Yates think
it wiser to let him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) pursue his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) own way, and feel the folly of it
without opposition. He (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) had known many disagreeable fathers before, and
often been struck with the inconveniences they occasioned, but never,
in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) life, had he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) seen one of that class so
unintelligibly moral, so infamously tyrannical as Sir Thomas. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was
not a man to be endured but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) children’s sake, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be
thankful to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) fair daughter Julia that Mr. Yates did yet mean to stay
a few days longer under his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) roof.

<p/>The evening passed with external smoothness, though almost every mind
was ruffled; and the music which Sir Thomas called for from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
daughters helped to conceal the want of real harmony. Maria was in a
good deal of agitation. It was of the utmost consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) that
Crawford should now lose no time in declaring himself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
disturbed that even a day should be gone by without seeming to advance
that point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had been expecting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the whole morning, and
all the evening, too, was still expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Mr. Rushworth had set
off early with the great news for Sotherton; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had fondly hoped
for such an immediate _eclaircissement_ as might save him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) the trouble
of ever coming back again. But they had seen no one from the Parsonage,
not a creature, and had heard no tidings beyond a friendly note of
congratulation and inquiry from Mrs. Grant to Lady Bertram. It was the
first day for many, many weeks, in which the families had been wholly
divided. Four-and-twenty hours had never passed before, since August
began, without bringing them together in some way or other. It was a
sad, anxious day; and the morrow, though differing in the sort of evil,
did by no means bring less. A few moments of feverish enjoyment were
followed by hours of acute suffering. Henry Crawford was again in the
house: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked up with Dr. Grant, who was anxious to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) respects
to Sir Thomas, and at rather an early hour they were ushered into the
breakfast-room, where were most of the family. Sir Thomas soon
appeared, and Maria saw with delight and agitation the introduction of
the man she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) loved to her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) father. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sensations were indefinable, and
so were they a few minutes afterwards upon hearing Henry Crawford, who
had a chair between herself and Tom, ask the latter in an undervoice
whether there were any plans for resuming the play after the present
happy interruption (with a courteous glance at Sir Thomas), because, in
that case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should make a point of returning to Mansfield at any time
required by the party: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was going away immediately, being to meet his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
uncle at Bath without delay; but if there were any prospect of a
renewal of Lovers’ Vows, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should hold himself positively engaged, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
should break through every other claim, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should absolutely condition
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) uncle for attending them whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might be wanted. The play
should not be lost by _his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)_ absence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"From Bath, Norfolk, London, York, wherever I may be,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"I will
attend you from any place in England, at an hour’s notice."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>It was well at that moment that Tom had to speak, and not his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) sister.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) could immediately say with easy fluency, <div class="bookquote">"I am sorry you are going;
but as to our play, _that_ is all over—entirely at an end"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>(looking
significantly at his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) father). "The painter was sent off yesterday, and
very little will remain of the theatre to-morrow. I knew how _that_
would be from the first. It is early for Bath. You will find nobody
there."

<p/>"It is about my uncle’s usual time."

<p/>"When do you think of going?"

<p/>"I may, perhaps, get as far as Banbury to-day."

<p/>"Whose stables do you use at Bath?" was the next question; and while
this branch of the subject was under discussion, Maria, who wanted
neither pride nor resolution, was preparing to encounter her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) share of
it with tolerable calmness.

<p/>To her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) soon turned, repeating much of what he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had already said, with
only a softened air and stronger expressions of regret. But what
availed his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) expressions or his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) air? He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was going, and, if not
voluntarily going, voluntarily intending to stay away; for, excepting
what might be due to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) uncle, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) engagements were all self-imposed.
He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) might talk of necessity, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) independence. The hand
which had so pressed hers to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heart! the hand and the heart were
alike motionless and passive now! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) spirit supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), but the
agony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) mind was severe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had not long to endure what arose
from listening to language which his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) actions contradicted, or to bury
the tumult of her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) feelings under the restraint of society; for general
civilities soon called his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) notice from her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), and the farewell visit, as
it then became openly acknowledged, was a very short one. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was
gone—he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) hand for the last time, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) parting
bow, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) might seek directly all that solitude could do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>).
Henry Crawford was gone, gone from the house, and within two hours
afterwards from the parish; and so ended all the hopes his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) selfish
vanity had raised in Maria and Julia Bertram.

<p/>Julia could rejoice that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was gone. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) presence was beginning to be
odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>); and if Maria gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was now cool enough to
dispense with any other revenge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) did not want exposure to be added
to desertion. Henry Crawford gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could even pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sister.

<p/>With a purer spirit did Fanny rejoice in the intelligence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard it
at dinner, and felt it a blessing. By all the others it was mentioned
with regret; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits honoured with due gradation of feeling—from
the sincerity of Edmund’s too partial regard, to the unconcern of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother speaking entirely by rote. Mrs. Norris began to look about her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>),
and wonder that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) falling in love with Julia had come to nothing; and
could almost fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had been remiss herself in forwarding it;
but with so many to care for, how was it possible for even _her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_
activity to keep pace with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) wishes?

<p/>Another day or two, and Mr. Yates was gone likewise. In _his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)_ departure
Sir Thomas felt the chief interest: wanting to be alone with his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
family, the presence of a stranger superior to Mr. Yates must have been
irksome; but of him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), trifling and confident, idle and expensive, it was
every way vexatious. In himself he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) was wearisome, but as the friend of
Tom and the admirer of Julia he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) became offensive. Sir Thomas had been
quite indifferent to Mr. Crawford’s going or staying: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good
wishes for Mr. Yates’s having a pleasant journey, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) walked with him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)
to the hall-door, were given with genuine satisfaction. Mr. Yates had
staid to see the destruction of every theatrical preparation at
Mansfield, the removal of everything appertaining to the play: he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) left
the house in all the soberness of its general character; and Sir Thomas
hoped, in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) out of it, to be rid of the worst object connected
with the scheme, and the last that must be inevitably reminding him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) of
its existence.

<p/>Mrs. Norris contrived to remove one article from his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sight that might
have distressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). The curtain, over which she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had presided with such
talent and such success, went off with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) cottage, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
happened to be particularly in want of green baize.
