<p/>No one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) infancy would have
supposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) born to be an heroine. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) situation in life, the
character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father and mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own person and disposition,
were all equally against her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father was a clergyman, without being
neglected, or poor, and a very respectable man, though his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name was
Richard—and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never been handsome. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had a considerable
independence besides two good livings—and he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in the least
addicted to locking up his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) daughters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) mother was a woman of useful
plain sense, with a good temper, and, what is more remarkable, with a
good constitution. She (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had three sons before Catherine was born; and
instead of dying in bringing the latter into the world, as anybody
might expect, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) still lived on—lived to have six children more—to see
them growing up around her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and to enjoy excellent health herself. A
family of ten children will be always called a fine family, where there
are heads and arms and legs enough for the number; but the Morlands had
little other right to the word, for they were in general very plain,
and Catherine, for many years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life, as plain as any. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had a
thin awkward figure, a sallow skin without colour, dark lank hair, and
strong features—so much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) person; and not less unpropitious for
heroism seemed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was fond of all boy’s plays, and greatly
preferred cricket not merely to dolls, but to the more heroic
enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or
watering a rose-bush. Indeed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had no taste for a garden; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
gathered flowers at all, it was chiefly for the pleasure of mischief—at
least so it was conjectured from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) always preferring those which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
was forbidden to take. Such were her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) propensities—her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) abilities were
quite as extraordinary. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) never could learn or understand anything
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was taught; and sometimes not even then, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was often
inattentive, and occasionally stupid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother was three months in
teaching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only to repeat the <div class="bookquote">"Beggar’s Petition" (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>; and after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
next sister, Sally, could say it better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did. Not that
Catherine was always stupid—by no means; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt the fable of <div class="bookquote">"The
Hare and Many Friends"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as quickly as any girl in England. Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother
wished her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to learn music; and Catherine was sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should like it,
for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was very fond of tinkling the keys of the old forlorn spinnet;
so, at eight years old she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt a year, and could not bear
it; and Mrs. Morland, who did not insist on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) daughters being
accomplished in spite of incapacity or distaste, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) to leave
off. The day which dismissed the music-master was one of the happiest
of Catherine’s life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) taste for drawing was not superior; though
whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could obtain the outside of a letter from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother or
seize upon any other odd piece of paper, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could in that
way, by drawing houses and trees, hens and chickens, all very much like
one another. Writing and accounts she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was taught by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father; French
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother: her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) proficiency in either was not remarkable, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
shirked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) lessons in both whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could. What a strange,
unaccountable character!—for with all these symptoms of profligacy at
ten years old, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had neither a bad heart nor a bad temper, was seldom
stubborn, scarcely ever quarrelsome, and very kind to the little ones,
with few interruptions of tyranny; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was moreover noisy and wild,
hated confinement and cleanliness, and loved nothing so well in the
world as rolling down the green slope at the back of the house.

<p/>Such was Catherine Morland at ten. At fifteen, appearances were
mending; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) began to curl her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) hair and long for balls; her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) complexion
improved, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) features were softened by plumpness and colour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) eyes
gained more animation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) figure more consequence. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) love of
dirt gave way to an inclination for finery, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) grew clean as she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
grew smart; she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) had now the pleasure of sometimes hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father
and mother remark on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) personal improvement. <div class="bookquote">"Catherine grows quite a
good-looking girl—she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is almost pretty today,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were words which caught
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ears now and then; and how welcome were the sounds! To look
_almost_ pretty is an acquisition of higher delight to a girl who has
been looking plain the first fifteen years of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) life than a beauty
from her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) cradle can ever receive.

<p/>Mrs. Morland was a very good woman, and wished to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) children
everything they ought to be; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) time was so much occupied in
lying-in and teaching the little ones, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) elder daughters were
inevitably left to shift for themselves; and it was not very wonderful
that Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), should
prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the
country at the age of fourteen, to books—or at least books of
information—for, provided that nothing like useful knowledge could be
gained from them, provided they were all story and no reflection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
had never any objection to books at all. But from fifteen to seventeen
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was in training for a heroine; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) read all such works as heroines
must read to supply their memories with those quotations which are so
serviceable and so soothing in the vicissitudes of their eventful
lives.

<p/>From Pope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learnt to censure those who

<p/><div class="bookquote">"bear about the mockery of woe."


 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>From Gray, that

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Many a flower is born to blush unseen,
" (<font color='red'><b>Gray</b></font>)</div>And waste its fragrance on the desert air."


<p/>From Thompson, that—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a delightful task
" (<font color='red'><b>Thompson that</b></font>)</div>To teach the young idea how to shoot."


<p/>And from Shakespeare she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gained a great store of information—amongst
the rest, that—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Trifles light as air,
" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Are, to the jealous, confirmation strong,
"As proofs of Holy Writ."


<p/>That

<p/>"The poor beetle, which we tread upon,
"In corporal sufferance feels a pang as great
<div class="bookquote">"As when a giant dies."


 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>And that a young woman in love always looks—

<p/>"like Patience on a monument
"Smiling at Grief."


<p/>So far her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) improvement was sufficient—and in many other points she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) came
on exceedingly well; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) could not write sonnets, she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
brought herself to read them; and though there seemed no chance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
throwing a whole party into raptures by a prelude on the pianoforte, of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) own composition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) could listen to other people’s performance
with very little fatigue. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) greatest deficiency was in the pencil—she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
had no notion of drawing—not enough even to attempt a sketch of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
lover’s profile, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) might be detected in the design. There she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>)
fell miserably short of the true heroic height. At present she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) did not
know her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) own poverty, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) had no lover to portray. She (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) had reached
the age of seventeen, without having seen one amiable youth who could
call forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) sensibility, without having inspired one real passion,
and without having excited even any admiration but what was very
moderate and very transient. This was strange indeed! But strange
things may be generally accounted for if their cause be fairly searched
out. There was not one lord in the neighbourhood; no—not even a
baronet. There was not one family among their acquaintance who had
reared and supported a boy accidentally found at their door—not one
young man whose origin was unknown. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Patience</b></font>) father had no ward, and the
squire of the parish no children.

<p/>But when a young lady is to be a heroine, the perverseness of forty
surrounding families cannot prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>). Something must and will happen
to throw a hero in her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) way.

<p/>Mr. Allen, who owned the chief of the property about Fullerton, the
village in Wiltshire where the Morlands lived, was ordered to Bath for
the benefit of a gouty constitution—and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) lady, a good-humoured
woman, fond of Miss Morland, and probably aware that if adventures will
not befall a young lady in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) own village, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must seek them abroad,
invited her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) to go with them. Mr. and Mrs. Morland were all compliance,
and Catherine all happiness.
