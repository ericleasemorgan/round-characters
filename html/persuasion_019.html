<p/>While Admiral Croft was taking this walk with Anne, and expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
wish of getting Captain Wentworth to Bath, Captain Wentworth was
already on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) way thither.  Before Mrs Croft had written, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
arrived, and the very next time Anne walked out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>Mr Elliot was attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) two cousins and Mrs Clay.  They were in
Milsom Street.  It began to rain, not much, but enough to make shelter
desirable for women, and quite enough to make it very desirable for
Miss Elliot to have the advantage of being conveyed home in Lady
Dalrymple's carriage, which was seen waiting at a little distance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>),
Anne, and Mrs Clay, therefore, turned into Molland's, while Mr Elliot
stepped to Lady Dalrymple, to request her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) assistance.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) soon joined
them again, successful, of course; Lady Dalrymple would be most happy
to take them home, and would call for them in a few minutes.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) ladyship's carriage was a barouche, and did not hold more than four
with any comfort.  Miss Carteret was with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) mother; consequently it
was not reasonable to expect accommodation for all the three Camden
Place ladies.  There could be no doubt as to Miss Elliot.  Whoever
suffered inconvenience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must suffer none, but it occupied a little
time to settle the point of civility between the other two.  The rain
was a mere trifle, and Anne was most sincere in preferring a walk with
Mr Elliot.  But the rain was also a mere trifle to Mrs Clay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would
hardly allow it even to drop at all, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) boots were so thick! much
thicker than Miss Anne's; and, in short, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) civility rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
quite as anxious to be left to walk with Mr Elliot as Anne could be,
and it was discussed between them with a generosity so polite and so
determined, that the others were obliged to settle it for them; Miss
Elliot maintaining that Mrs Clay had a little cold already, and Mr
Elliot deciding on appeal, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin Anne's boots were rather the
thickest.

<p/>It was fixed accordingly, that Mrs Clay should be of the party in the
carriage; and they had just reached this point, when Anne, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sat
near the window, descried, most decidedly and distinctly, Captain
Wentworth walking down the street.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) start was perceptible only to herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) instantly felt that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was the greatest simpleton in the world, the most unaccountable and
absurd!  For a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw nothing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); it was all
confusion.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was lost, and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had scolded back her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) senses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
found the others still waiting for the carriage, and Mr Elliot (always
obliging) just setting off for Union Street on a commission of Mrs
Clay's.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) now felt a great inclination to go to the outer door; she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) wanted to
see if it rained.  Why was she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to suspect herself of another motive?
Captain Wentworth must be out of sight.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) seat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would
go; one half of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) should not be always so much wiser than the other
half, or always suspecting the other of being worse than it was.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
would see if it rained.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was sent back, however, in a moment by the
entrance of Captain Wentworth himself, among a party of gentlemen and
ladies, evidently his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) acquaintance, and whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) must have joined a
little below Milsom Street.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was more obviously struck and confused
by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had ever observed before; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) looked quite
red.  For the first time, since their renewed acquaintance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was betraying the least sensibility of the two.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had the
advantage of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in the preparation of the last few moments.  All the
overpowering, blinding, bewildering, first effects of strong surprise
were over with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>).  Still, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had enough to feel!  It was
agitation, pain, pleasure, a something between delight and misery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and then turned away.  The character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) manner was
embarrassment.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not have called it either cold or friendly,
or anything so certainly as embarrassed.

<p/>After a short interval, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>), and spoke again.
Mutual enquiries on common subjects passed:  neither of them, probably,
much the wiser for what they heard, and Anne continuing fully sensible
of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) being less at ease than formerly.  They had by dint of being so
very much together, got to speak to each other with a considerable
portion of apparent indifference and calmness; but he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could not do it
now.  Time had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), or Louisa had changed him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>).  There was
consciousness of some sort or other.  He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) looked very well, not as if he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
had been suffering in health or spirits, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) talked of Uppercross,
of the Musgroves, nay, even of Louisa, and had even a momentary look of
his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own arch significance as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) named her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>); but yet it was Captain
Wentworth not comfortable, not easy, not able to feign that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was.

<p/>It did not surprise, but it grieved Anne to observe that Elizabeth
would not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw Elizabeth, that Elizabeth saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), that there was complete internal recognition on each side; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
convinced that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was ready to be acknowledged as an acquaintance,
expecting it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the pain of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister turn away with
unalterable coldness.

<p/>Lady Dalrymple's carriage, for which Miss Elliot was growing very
impatient, now drew up; the servant came in to announce it.  It was
beginning to rain again, and altogether there was a delay, and a
bustle, and a talking, which must make all the little crowd in the shop
understand that Lady Dalrymple was calling to convey Miss Elliot.  At
last Miss Elliot and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend, unattended but by the servant, (for
there was no cousin returned), were walking off; and Captain Wentworth,
watching them, turned again to Anne, and by manner, rather than words,
was offering his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) services to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>"I am much obliged to you,<div class="bookquote">" was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) answer, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but I am not going with
them.  The carriage would not accommodate so many.  I walk:  I prefer
walking."

<p/>"But it rains."

<p/>"Oh! very little,  Nothing that I regard."

<p/>After a moment's pause he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said:  <div class="bookquote">"Though I came only yesterday, I have
equipped myself properly for Bath already, you see,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>(pointing to a new
umbrella); "I wish you would make use of it, if you are determined to
walk; though I think it would be more prudent to let me get you a
chair."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was very much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), but declined it all, repeating her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
conviction, that the rain would come to nothing at present, and adding,
"I am only waiting for Mr Elliot.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) will be here in a moment, I am
sure."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had hardly spoken the words when Mr Elliot walked in.  Captain
Wentworth recollected him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perfectly.  There was no difference between
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) and the man who had stood on the steps at Lyme, admiring Anne as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed, except in the air and look and manner of the privileged
relation and friend.  He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) came in with eagerness, appeared to see and
think only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), apologised for his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stay, was grieved to have kept
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) waiting, and anxious to get her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) away without further loss of time
and before the rain increased; and in another moment they walked off
together, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arm under his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), a gentle and embarrassed glance, and a
<div class="bookquote">"Good morning to you!"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>being all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had time for, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) passed
away.

<p/>As soon as they were out of sight, the ladies of Captain Wentworth's
party began talking of them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr Elliot does not dislike his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin, I fancy?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! no, that is clear enough.  One can guess what will happen there.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is always with them; half lives in the family, I believe.  What a
very good-looking man!"

<p/>"Yes, and Miss Atkinson, who dined with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) once at the Wallises, says
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is the most agreeable man she (<font color='blue'><b>Atkinson</b></font>) ever was in company with."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Atkinson</b></font>) is pretty, I think; Anne Elliot; very pretty, when one comes to
look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  It is not the fashion to say so, but I confess I admire
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) more than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! so do I."

 (<font color='red'><b>I.</b></font>)</div><p/>"And so do I.  No comparison.  But the men are all wild after Miss
Elliot.  Anne is too delicate for them."

<p/>Anne would have been particularly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cousin, if he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) would
have walked by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) side all the way to Camden Place, without saying a
word.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never found it so difficult to listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), though
nothing could exceed his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) solicitude and care, and though his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) subjects
were principally such as were wont to be always interesting: praise,
warm, just, and discriminating, of Lady Russell, and insinuations
highly rational against Mrs Clay.  But just now she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could think only of
Captain Wentworth.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) present feelings,
whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) were really suffering much from disappointment or not; and
till that point were settled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not be quite herself.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) hoped to be wise and reasonable in time; but alas! alas!  she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) must
confess to herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) was not wise yet.

<p/>Another circumstance very essential for her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to know, was how long he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
meant to be in Bath; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not mentioned it, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not
recollect it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might be only passing through.  But it was more
probable that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should be come to stay.  In that case, so liable as
every body was to meet every body in Bath, Lady Russell would in all
likelihood see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) somewhere.  Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) recollect him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)?  How would it
all be?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had already been obliged to tell Lady Russell that Louisa Musgrove
was to marry Captain Benwick.  It had cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) something to encounter
Lady Russell's surprise; and now, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) were by any chance to be
thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) imperfect knowledge of
the matter might add another shade of prejudice against him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>The following morning Anne was out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friend, and for the first
hour, in an incessant and fearful sort of watch for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in vain; but at
last, in returning down Pulteney Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distinguished him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) on the
right hand pavement at such a distance as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) in view the
greater part of the street.  There were many other men about him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), many
groups walking the same way, but there was no mistaking him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
looked instinctively at Lady Russell; but not from any mad idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
recognising him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) so soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did herself.  No, it was not to be
supposed that Lady Russell would perceive him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) till they were nearly
opposite.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) however, from time to time, anxiously; and
when the moment approached which must point him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) out, though not daring
to look again (for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own countenance she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) knew was unfit to be seen),
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was yet perfectly conscious of Lady Russell's eyes being turned
exactly in the direction for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)--of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) being, in short, intently
observing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could thoroughly comprehend the sort of fascination
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must possess over Lady Russell's mind, the difficulty it must be for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to withdraw her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) eyes, the astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must be feeling that
eight or nine years should have passed over him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and in foreign climes
and in active service too, without robbing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) of one personal grace!

<p/>At last, Lady Russell drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) head.  <div class="bookquote">"Now, how would she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) speak of
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"You will wonder,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), "what has been fixing my eye so long; but
I was looking after some window-curtains, which Lady Alicia and Mrs
Frankland were telling me of last night.  They described the
drawing-room window-curtains of one of the houses on this side of the
way, and this part of the street, as being the handsomest and best hung
of any in Bath, but could not recollect the exact number, and I have
been trying to find out which it could be; but I confess I can see no
curtains hereabouts that answer their description."

<p/>Anne sighed and blushed and smiled, in pity and disdain, either at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
friend or herself.  The part which provoked her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most, was that in all
this waste of foresight and caution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should have lost the right
moment for seeing whether he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) saw them.

<p/>A day or two passed without producing anything.  The theatre or the
rooms, where he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was most likely to be, were not fashionable enough for
the Elliots, whose evening amusements were solely in the elegant
stupidity of private parties, in which they were getting more and more
engaged; and Anne, wearied of such a state of stagnation, sick of
knowing nothing, and fancying herself stronger because her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) strength was
not tried, was quite impatient for the concert evening.  It was a
concert for the benefit of a person patronised by Lady Dalrymple.  Of
course they must attend.  It was really expected to be a good one, and
Captain Wentworth was very fond of music.  If she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) could only have a few
minutes conversation with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) should be
satisfied; and as to the power of addressing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) felt all over
courage if the opportunity occurred.  Elizabeth had turned from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
Lady Russell overlooked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) nerves were strengthened by these
circumstances; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attention.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had once partly promised Mrs Smith to spend the evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>);
but in a short hurried call she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) excused herself and put it off, with
the more decided promise of a longer visit on the morrow.  Mrs Smith
gave a most good-humoured acquiescence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"By all means,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); "only tell me all about it, when you do come.
Who is your party?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Anne named them all.  Mrs Smith made no reply; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was leaving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) said, and with an expression half serious, half arch, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well, I
heartily wish your concert may answer; and do not fail me to-morrow if
you can come; for I begin to have a foreboding that I may not have many
more visits from you."

<p/>Anne was startled and confused; but after standing in a moment's
suspense, was obliged, and not sorry to be obliged, to hurry away.
