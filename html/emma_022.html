<p/>Human nature is so well disposed towards those who are in interesting situations, that a young person, who either marries or dies, is sure of being kindly spoken of.

<p/>A week had not passed since Miss Hawkins's name was first mentioned in Highbury, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) was, by some means or other, discovered to have every recommendation of person and mind; to be handsome, elegant, highly accomplished, and perfectly amiable: and when Mr. Elton himself arrived to triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happy prospects, and circulate the fame of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) merits, there was very little more for him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to do, than to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) Christian name, and say whose music she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) principally played.

<p/>Mr. Elton returned, a very happy man. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had gone away rejected and mortified disappointed in a very sanguine hope, after a series of what appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) strong encouragement; and not only losing the right lady, but finding himself debased to the level of a very wrong one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had gone away deeply offended he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back engaged to another and to another as superior, of course, to the first, as under such circumstances what is gained always is to what is lost. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) came back gay and self-satisfied, eager and busy, caring nothing for Miss Woodhouse, and defying Miss Smith.

<p/>The charming Augusta Hawkins, in addition to all the usual advantages of perfect beauty and merit, was in possession of an independent fortune, of so many thousands as would always be called ten; a point of some dignity, as well as some convenience: the story told well; he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had not thrown himself away he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained a woman of 10,000 l. or thereabouts; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had gained her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with such delightful rapidity the first hour of introduction had been so very soon followed by distinguishing notice; the history which he (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had to give Mrs. Cole of the rise and progress of the affair was so glorious the steps so quick, from the accidental rencontre, to the dinner at Mr. Green's, and the party at Mrs. Brown's smiles and blushes rising in importance with consciousness and agitation richly scattered the lady had been so easily impressed so sweetly disposed had in short, to use a most intelligible phrase, been so very ready to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), that vanity and prudence were equally contented.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had caught both substance and shadow both fortune and affection, and was just the happy man he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to be; talking only of himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own concerns expecting to be congratulated ready to be laughed at and, with cordial, fearless smiles, now addressing all the young ladies of the place, to whom, a few weeks ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been more cautiously gallant.

<p/>The wedding was no distant event, as the parties had only themselves to please, and nothing but the necessary preparations to wait for; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) set out for Bath again, there was a general expectation, which a certain glance of Mrs. Cole's did not seem to contradict, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) next entered Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bride.

<p/>During his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) present short stay, Emma had barely seen him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but just enough to feel that the first meeting was over, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the impression of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not being improved by the mixture of pique and pretension, now spread over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) air. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, in fact, beginning very much to wonder that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever thought him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasing at all; and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sight was so inseparably connected with some very disagreeable feelings, that, except in a moral light, as a penance, a lesson, a source of profitable humiliation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have been thankful to be assured of never seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) very well; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pain, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) welfare twenty miles off would administer most satisfaction.

<p/>The pain of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) continued residence in Highbury, however, must certainly be lessened by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) marriage. Many vain solicitudes would be prevented many awkwardnesses smoothed by it. A Mrs. Elton would be an excuse for any change of intercourse; former intimacy might sink without remark. It would be almost beginning their life of civility again.

<p/>Of the lady, individually, Emma thought very little. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was good enough for Mr. Elton, no doubt; accomplished enough for Highbury handsome enough to look plain, probably, by Harriet's side. As to connexion, there Emma was perfectly easy; persuaded, that after all his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own vaunted claims and disdain of Harriet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had done nothing. On that article, truth seemed attainable. What she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, must be uncertain; but who she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, might be found out; and setting aside the 10,000 l., it did not appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was at all Harriet's superior. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brought no name, no blood, no alliance. Miss Hawkins was the youngest of the two daughters of a Bristol merchant, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) must be called; but, as the whole of the profits of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) mercantile life appeared so very moderate, it was not unfair to guess the dignity of his (<font color='blue'><b>merchant</b></font>) line of trade had been very moderate also. Part of every winter she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) had been used to spend in Bath; but Bristol was her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) home, the very heart of Bristol; for though the father and mother had died some years ago, an uncle remained in the law line nothing more distinctly honourable was hazarded of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), than that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was in the law line; and with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) the daughter had lived. Emma guessed him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to be the drudge of some attorney, and too stupid to rise. And all the grandeur of the connexion seemed dependent on the elder sister, who was very well married, to a gentleman in a great way, near Bristol, who kept two carriages! That was the wind-up of the history; that was the glory of Miss Hawkins.

<p/>Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) but have given Harriet her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feelings about it all! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had talked her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) into love; but, alas! she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not so easily to be talked out of it. The charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of Harriet's mind was not to be talked away. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) might be superseded by another; he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a Robert Martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) feared, would cure her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. And now, poor girl! she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was considerably worse from this reappearance of Mr. Elton. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was always having a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) somewhere or other. Emma saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only once; but two or three times every day Harriet was sure just to meet with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), or just to miss him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), just to hear his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice, or see his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) fancy, in all the favouring warmth of surprize and conjecture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, moreover, perpetually hearing about him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); for, excepting when at Hartfield, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was always among those who saw no fault in Mr. Elton, and found nothing so interesting as the discussion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) concerns; and every report, therefore, every guess all that had already occurred, all that might occur in the arrangement of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) affairs, comprehending income, servants, and furniture, was continually in agitation around her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regard was receiving strength by invariable praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) regrets kept alive, and feelings irritated by ceaseless repetitions of Miss Hawkins's happiness, and continual observation of, how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed attached! his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) air as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) walked by the house the very sitting of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hat, being all in proof of how much he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was in love!

<p/>Had it been allowable entertainment, had there been no pain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hawkins</b></font>) friend, or reproach to herself, in the waverings of Harriet's mind, Emma would have been amused by its variations. Sometimes Mr. Elton predominated, sometimes the Martins; and each was occasionally useful as a check to the other. Mr. Elton's engagement had been the cure of the agitation of meeting Mr. Martin. The unhappiness produced by the knowledge of that engagement had been a little put aside by Elizabeth Martin's calling at Mrs. Goddard's a few days afterwards. Harriet had not been at home; but a note had been prepared and left for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), written in the very style to touch; a small mixture of reproach, with a great deal of kindness; and till Mr. Elton himself appeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had been much occupied by it, continually pondering over what could be done in return, and wishing to do more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) dared to confess. But Mr. Elton, in person, had driven away all such cares. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) staid, the Martins were forgotten; and on the very morning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martins</b></font>) setting off for Bath again, Emma, to dissipate some of the distress it occasioned, judged it best for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to return Elizabeth Martin's visit.

<p/>How that visit was to be acknowledged what would be necessary and what might be safest, had been a point of some doubtful consideration. Absolute neglect of the mother and sisters, when invited to come, would be ingratitude. It must not be: and yet the danger of a renewal of the acquaintance !

<p/>After much thinking, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could determine on nothing better, than Harriet's returning the visit; but in a way that, if they had understanding, should convince them that it was to be only a formal acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the carriage, leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at the Abbey Mill, while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) drove a little farther, and call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) again so soon, as to allow no time for insidious applications or dangerous recurrences to the past, and give the most decided proof of what degree of intimacy was chosen for the future.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could think of nothing better: and though there was something in it which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own heart could not approve something of ingratitude, merely glossed over it must be done, or what would become of Harriet?
