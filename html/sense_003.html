<p/>Mrs. Dashwood remained at Norland several months; not from any
disinclination to move when the sight of every well known spot ceased
to raise the violent emotion which it produced for a while; for when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits began to revive, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind became capable of some other
exertion than that of heightening its affliction by melancholy
remembrances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was impatient to be gone, and indefatigable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
inquiries for a suitable dwelling in the neighbourhood of Norland; for
to remove far from that beloved spot was impossible. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) could hear
of no situation that at once answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) notions of comfort and ease,
and suited the prudence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest daughter, whose steadier judgment
rejected several houses as too large for their income, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mother
would have approved.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood had been informed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) husband of the solemn promise on
the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) son in their favour, which gave comfort to his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) last
earthly reflections. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) doubted the sincerity of this assurance no
more than he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had doubted it himself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thought of it for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughters’ sake with satisfaction, though as for herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
persuaded that a much smaller provision than 7000£ would support her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) in
affluence. For their brother’s sake, too, for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own
heart, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) rejoiced; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) reproached herself for being unjust to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
merit before, in believing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) incapable of generosity. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attentive
behaviour to herself and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sisters convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that their welfare
was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and, for a long time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) firmly relied on the
liberality of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) intentions.

<p/>The contempt which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had, very early in their acquaintance, felt for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law, was very much increased by the farther knowledge
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) character, which half a year’s residence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) family afforded;
and perhaps in spite of every consideration of politeness or maternal
affection on the side of the former, the two ladies might have found it
impossible to have lived together so long, had not a particular
circumstance occurred to give still greater eligibility, according to
the opinions of Mrs. Dashwood, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters’ continuance at
Norland.

<p/>This circumstance was a growing attachment between her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eldest girl and
the brother of Mrs. John Dashwood, a gentleman-like and pleasing young
man, who was introduced to their acquaintance soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister’s
establishment at Norland, and who had since spent the greatest part of
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) time there.

<p/>Some mothers might have encouraged the intimacy from motives of
interest, for Edward Ferrars was the eldest son of a man who had died
very rich; and some might have repressed it from motives of prudence,
for, except a trifling sum, the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fortune depended on the
will of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother. But Mrs. Dashwood was alike uninfluenced by either
consideration. It was enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be amiable,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, and that Elinor returned the partiality. It
was contrary to every doctrine of hers that difference of fortune
should keep any couple asunder who were attracted by resemblance of
disposition; and that Elinor’s merit should not be acknowledged by
every one who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) comprehension impossible.

<p/>Edward Ferrars was not recommended to their good opinion by any
peculiar graces of person or address. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was not handsome, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
manners required intimacy to make them pleasing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was too diffident
to do justice to himself; but when his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) natural shyness was overcome,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) behaviour gave every indication of an open, affectionate heart. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
understanding was good, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) education had given it solid
improvement. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was neither fitted by abilities nor disposition to
answer the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother and sister, who longed to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>)
distinguished—as—they hardly knew what. They wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to make a fine
figure in the world in some manner or other. His (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) mother wished to
interest him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) in political concerns, to get him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) into parliament, or to
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) connected with some of the great men of the day. Mrs. John
Dashwood wished it likewise; but in the mean while, till one of these
superior blessings could be attained, it would have quieted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
ambition to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) driving a barouche. But Edward had no turn for
great men or barouches. All his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wishes centered in domestic comfort and
the quiet of private life. Fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had a younger brother who was
more promising.

<p/>Edward had been staying several weeks in the house before he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engaged
much of Mrs. Dashwood’s attention; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was, at that time, in such
affliction as rendered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) careless of surrounding objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) saw
only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was quiet and unobtrusive, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
did not disturb the wretchedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) mind by ill-timed conversation.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was first called to observe and approve him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) farther, by a
reflection which Elinor chanced one day to make on the difference
between him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister. It was a contrast which recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
most forcibly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is enough,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); "to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is unlike Fanny is enough. It
implies everything amiable. I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) already."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I think you will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "when you know more of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)."

<p/>"Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)!<div class="bookquote">" replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother with a smile. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I feel no sentiment of
approbation inferior to love."

<p/>"You may esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)."

<p/>"I have never yet known what it was to separate esteem and love."

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood now took pains to get acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) manners
were attaching, and soon banished his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) reserve. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) speedily
comprehended all his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits; the persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for Elinor
perhaps assisted her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) penetration; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really felt assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
worth: and even that quietness of manner, which militated against all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) established ideas of what a young man’s address ought to be, was no
longer uninteresting when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart to be warm and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) temper
affectionate.

<p/>No sooner did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) perceive any symptom of love in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour to
Elinor, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) considered their serious attachment as certain, and
looked forward to their marriage as rapidly approaching.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"In a few months, my dear Marianne,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), "Elinor will, in all
probability be settled for life. We shall miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); but _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ will be
happy."

<p/>"Oh! Mama, how shall we do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>)?"

<p/>"My love, it will be scarcely a separation. We shall live within a few
miles of each other, and shall meet every day of our lives. You will
gain a brother, a real, affectionate brother. I have the highest
opinion in the world of Edward’s heart. But you look grave, Marianne;
do you disapprove your sister’s choice?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "I may consider it with some surprise. Edward
is very amiable, and I love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tenderly. But yet—he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not the kind of
young man—there is something wanting—his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) figure is not striking; it has
none of that grace which I should expect in the man who could seriously
attach my sister. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eyes want all that spirit, that fire, which at
once announce virtue and intelligence. And besides all this, I am
afraid, Mama, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has no real taste. Music seems scarcely to attract
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires Elinor’s drawings very much, it is not the
admiration of a person who can understand their worth. It is evident,
in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) frequent attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) draws, that in fact
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knows nothing of the matter. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) admires as a lover, not as a
connoisseur. To satisfy me, those characters must be united. I could
not be happy with a man whose taste did not in every point coincide
with my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must enter into all my feelings; the same books, the
same music must charm us both. Oh! mama, how spiritless, how tame was
Edward’s manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most
severely. Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) bore it with so much composure, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) seemed scarcely
to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful
lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such
impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference!"


<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would certainly have done more justice to simple and elegant prose.
I thought so at the time; but you _would_ give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) Cowper."

<p/>"Nay, Mama, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not to be animated by Cowper!—but we must allow
for difference of taste. Elinor has not my feelings, and therefore she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
may overlook it, and be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). But it would have broke _my_
heart, had I loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) read with so little sensibility.
Mama, the more I know of the world, the more am I convinced that I
shall never see a man whom I can really love. I require so much! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
must have all Edward’s virtues, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) person and manners must
ornament his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness with every possible charm."

<p/>"Remember, my love, that you are not seventeen. It is yet too early in
life to despair of such a happiness. Why should you be less fortunate
than your mother? In one circumstance only, my Marianne, may your
destiny be different from hers!"
