<p/>Marianne’s illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been long
enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother’s presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
to remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs.
Palmer’s dressing-room. When there, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own particular request, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) was impatient to pour forth her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) thanks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) for fetching her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
mother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>).

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) emotion on entering the room, in seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) altered looks, and in
receiving the pale hand which she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) immediately held out to him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), was
such, as, in Elinor’s conjecture, must arise from something more than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) affection for Marianne, or the consciousness of its being known to
others; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) soon discovered in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) melancholy eye and varying
complexion as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, the probable recurrence of many
past scenes of misery to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind, brought back by that resemblance
between Marianne and Eliza already acknowledged, and now strengthened
by the hollow eye, the sickly skin, the posture of reclining weakness,
and the warm acknowledgment of peculiar obligation.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood, not less watchful of what passed than her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, but
with a mind very differently influenced, and therefore watching to very
different effect, saw nothing in the Colonel’s behaviour but what arose
from the most simple and self-evident sensations, while in the actions
and words of Marianne she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) persuaded herself to think that something
more than gratitude already dawned.

<p/>At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly stronger
every twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
daughter’s wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On _her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)_
measures depended those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) two friends; Mrs. Jennings could not
quit Cleveland during the Dashwoods’ stay; and Colonel Brandon was soon
brought, by their united request, to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) own abode there as
equally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) and Mrs.
Jennings’s united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on to
accept the use of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) carriage on her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) journey back, for the better
accommodation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) sick child; and the Colonel, at the joint
invitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-nature
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself,
engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in the
course of a few weeks.

<p/>The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after taking
so particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestly
grateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own
heart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and bidding
Colonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefully
assisted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) into the carriage, of which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) seemed anxious that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
should engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed,
and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, and
feel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) chaise
to take comfort in the gossip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) maid for the loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) two young
companions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
solitary way to Delaford.

<p/>The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) journey
on both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealous
affection, the most solicitous care could do to render her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) comfortable,
was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their reward
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) bodily ease, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) calmness of spirits. To Elinor, the
observation of the latter was particularly grateful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), who had seen
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish of
heart which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude to
conceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, an
apparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) trusted
of serious reflection, must eventually lead her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to contentment and
cheerfulness.

<p/>As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which every
field and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face from their
notice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinor could
neither wonder nor blame; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assisted Marianne
from the carriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had been crying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw only an emotion
too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in
its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) subsequent
manner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) traced the direction of a mind awakened to reasonable
exertion; for no sooner had they entered their common sitting-room,
than Marianne turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes around it with a look of resolute
firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to the sight of
every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could be
connected.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness,
and though a sigh sometimes escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), it never passed away without
the atonement of a smile. After dinner she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would try her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) piano-forte.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went to it; but the music on which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye first rested was an
opera, procured for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by Willoughby, containing some of their
favourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own name in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
hand-writing.—That would not do.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) head, put the music
aside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained of
feebleness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaring
however with firmness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did so, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should in future practice
much.

<p/>The next morning produced no abatement in these happy symptoms. On the
contrary, with a mind and body alike strengthened by rest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) looked
and spoke with more genuine spirit, anticipating the pleasure of
Margaret’s return, and talking of the dear family party which would
then be restored, of their mutual pursuits and cheerful society, as the
only happiness worth a wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When the weather is settled, and I have recovered my strength,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), "we will take long walks together every day. We will walk to the
farm at the edge of the down, and see how the children go on; we will
walk to Sir John’s new plantations at Barton Cross, and the Abbeyland;
and we will often go to the old ruins of the Priory, and try to trace
its foundations as far as we are told they once reached. I know we
shall be happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never
to be later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shall
divide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan,
and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our own
library is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyond
mere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at the
Park; and there are others of more modern production which I know I can
borrow of Colonel Brandon. By reading only six hours a-day, I shall
gain in the course of a twelve-month a great deal of instruction which
I now feel myself to want."

<p/>Elinor honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for a plan which originated so nobly as this;
though smiling to see the same eager fancy which had been leading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
to the extreme of languid indolence and selfish repining, now at work
in introducing excess into a scheme of such rational employment and
virtuous self-control. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) smile however changed to a sigh when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
remembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and feared
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind of
Marianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busy
tranquillity. Willing therefore to delay the evil hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolved to
wait till her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s health were more secure, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appointed
it. But the resolution was made only to be broken.

<p/>Marianne had been two or three days at home, before the weather was
fine enough for an invalid like herself to venture out. But at last a
soft, genial morning appeared; such as might tempt the daughter’s
wishes and the mother’s confidence; and Marianne, leaning on Elinor’s
arm, was authorised to walk as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could without fatigue, in
the lane before the house.

<p/>The sisters set out at a pace, slow as the feebleness of Marianne in an
exercise hitherto untried since her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) illness required; and they had
advanced only so far beyond the house as to admit a full view of the
hill, the important hill behind, when pausing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes turned
towards it, Marianne calmly said,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There, exactly there," (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>—pointing with one hand, "on that projecting
mound,—there I fell; and there I first saw Willoughby."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) voice sunk with the word, but presently reviving she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) added,

<p/>"I am thankful to find that I can look with so little pain on the spot!
shall we ever talk on that subject, Elinor?<div class="bookquote">" hesitatingly it was said.
" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Or will it be wrong? I _can_ talk of it now, I hope, as I ought to
do.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor tenderly invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be open.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>As for regret," said Marianne, "I have done with that, as far as _he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_
is concerned. I do not mean to talk to you of what my feelings have
been for him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), but what they are _now_. At present, if I could be
satisfied on one point, if I could be allowed to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was not
_always_ acting a part, not _always_ deceiving me; but above all, if I
could be assured that he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) never was so _very_ wicked as my fears have
sometimes fancied him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), since the story of that unfortunate girl—"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopt. Elinor joyfully treasured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) answered,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you could be assured of that, you think you should be easy."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes. My peace of mind is doubly involved in it; for not only is it
horrible to suspect a person, who has been what _he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ has been to _me_,
of such designs, but what must it make me appear to myself? What in a
situation like mine, but a most shamefully unguarded affection could
expose me to—"

 (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"How then,"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, "would you account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) behaviour?"

<p/>"I would suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>),—Oh, how gladly would I suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), only fickle,
very, very fickle."

<p/>Elinor said no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was debating within herself on the eligibility
of beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) story directly, or postponing it till Marianne were in
stronger health;—and they crept on for a few minutes in silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am not wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) too much good,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne at last with a
sigh, "when I wish his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) secret reflections may be no more unpleasant
than my own. He (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) will suffer enough in them."

<p/>"Do you compare your conduct with his (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?"

<p/>"No. I compare it with what it ought to have been; I compare it with
yours."

<p/>"Our situations have borne little resemblance."

<p/>"They have borne more than our conduct. Do not, my dearest Elinor, let
your kindness defend what I know your judgment must censure. My illness
has made me think. It has given me leisure and calmness for serious
recollection. Long before I was enough recovered to talk, I was
perfectly able to reflect. I considered the past: I saw in my own
behaviour, since the beginning of our acquaintance with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) last
autumn, nothing but a series of imprudence towards myself, and want of
kindness to others. I saw that my own feelings had prepared my
sufferings, and that my want of fortitude under them had almost led me
to the grave. My illness, I well knew, had been entirely brought on by
myself by such negligence of my own health, as I had felt even at the
time to be wrong. Had I died, it would have been self-destruction. I
did not know my danger till the danger was removed; but with such
feelings as these reflections gave me, I wonder at my recovery,—wonder
that the very eagerness of my desire to live, to have time for
atonement to my God, and to you all, did not kill me at once. Had I
died, in what peculiar misery should I have left you, my nurse, my
friend, my sister! You, who had seen all the fretful selfishness of my
latter days; who had known all the murmurings of my heart! How should I
have lived in _your_ remembrance! My mother too! How could you have
consoled her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)! I cannot express my own abhorrence of myself. Whenever I
looked towards the past, I saw some duty neglected, or some failing
indulged. Every body seemed injured by me. The kindness, the unceasing
kindness of Mrs. Jennings, I had repaid with ungrateful contempt. To
the Middletons, to the Palmers, the Steeles, to every common
acquaintance even, I had been insolent and unjust; with a heart
hardened against their merits, and a temper irritated by their very
attention. To John, to Fanny, yes, even to them, little as they
deserve, I had given less than their due. But you, you above all, above
my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and
its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me?—not to any compassion
that could benefit you or myself.—Your example was before me; but to
what avail? Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I
imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part
in those offices of general complaisance or particular gratitude which
you had hitherto been left to discharge alone? No; not less when I knew
you to be unhappy, than when I had believed you at ease, did I turn
away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing
sorrow to exist but with me, regretting only _that_ heart which had
deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an
unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake."

<p/>Here ceased the rapid flow of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) self-reproving spirit; and Elinor,
impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly
that praise and support which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) frankness and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contrition so well
deserved. Marianne pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand and replied,—

<p/>"You are very good.—The future must be my proof. I have laid down my
plan, and if I am capable of adhering to it—my feelings shall be
governed and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor
torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, my mother,
and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you will share my
affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, I shall never
again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mix in other
society, it will be only to show that my spirit is humbled, my heart
amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesser duties of
life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby—to say that I
shall soon or that I shall ever forget him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), would be idle. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances or opinions.
But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason,
by constant employment."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) paused—and added in a low voice, "If I could but know _his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)_ heart,
everything would become easy.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety or
impropriety of speedily hazarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) narration, without feeling at all
nearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that as
reflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herself
leading to the fact.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) managed the recital, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hoped, with address; prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chief
points on which Willoughby grounded his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) apology; did justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
repentance, and softened only his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) protestations of present regard.
Marianne said not a word.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) trembled, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were fixed on the
ground, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. A
thousand inquiries sprung up from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heart, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dared not urge
one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand,
unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s, and tears covered
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cheeks.

<p/>Elinor, dreading her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) being tired, led her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) towards home; and till they
reached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) curiosity
must be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothing
but Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefully
minute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness could
be safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with a
kiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
tears, " (<font color='red'><b>mama</b></font>)</div>Tell mama," withdrew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister and walked slowly up
stairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonable as
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging its
result, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Marianne
fail to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) turned into the parlour to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) parting
injunction.
