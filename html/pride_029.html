<p/>Mr. Collins’s triumph, in consequence of this invitation, was
complete. The power of displaying the grandeur of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) patroness
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wondering visitors, and of letting them see her (<font color='blue'><b>patroness</b></font>) civility
towards himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife, was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had wished for;
and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon, was
such an instance of Lady Catherine’s condescension, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) knew
not how to admire enough.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I confess,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), "that I should not have been at all
surprised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship’s asking us on Sunday to drink tea and
spend the evening at Rosings. I rather expected, from my
knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) affability, that it would happen. But who could
have foreseen such an attention as this? Who could have imagined
that we should receive an invitation to dine there (an
invitation, moreover, including the whole party) so immediately
after your arrival!"

<p/>"I am the less surprised at what has happened,<div class="bookquote">" replied Sir
William, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>from that knowledge of what the manners of the great
really are, which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire.
About the court, such instances of elegant breeding are not
uncommon."

<p/>Scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but
their visit to Rosings. Mr. Collins was carefully instructing
them in what they were to expect, that the sight of such rooms,
so many servants, and so splendid a dinner, might not wholly
overpower them.

<p/>When the ladies were separating for the toilette, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) said to
Elizabeth—

<p/>"Do not make yourself uneasy, my dear cousin, about your apparel.
Lady Catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us
which becomes herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter. I would advise you merely
to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the rest—there
is no occasion for anything more. Lady Catherine will not think
the worse of you for being simply dressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) likes to have the
distinction of rank preserved."

<p/>While they were dressing, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) came two or three times to their
different doors, to recommend their being quick, as Lady
Catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dinner.
Such formidable accounts of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manner of
living, quite frightened Maria Lucas who had been little used to
company, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) introduction at Rosings
with as much apprehension as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father had done to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
presentation at St. James’s.

<p/>As the weather was fine, they had a pleasant walk of about half a
mile across the park. Every park has its beauty and its
prospects; and Elizabeth saw much to be pleased with, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not be in such raptures as Mr. Collins expected the scene
to inspire, and was but slightly affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) enumeration of
the windows in front of the house, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relation of what the
glazing altogether had originally cost Sir Lewis de Bourgh.

<p/>When they ascended the steps to the hall, Maria’s alarm was every
moment increasing, and even Sir William did not look perfectly
calm. Elizabeth’s courage did not fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard nothing
of Lady Catherine that spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) awful from any extraordinary
talents or miraculous virtue, and the mere stateliness of money
or rank she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could witness without trepidation.

<p/>From the entrance-hall, of which Mr. Collins pointed out, with a
rapturous air, the fine proportion and the finished ornaments,
they followed the servants through an ante-chamber, to the room
where Lady Catherine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, and Mrs. Jenkinson were
sitting. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, with great condescension, arose to receive
them; and as Mrs. Collins had settled it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) husband that
the office of introduction should be hers, it was performed in a
proper manner, without any of those apologies and thanks which he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
would have thought necessary.

<p/>In spite of having been at St. James’s, Sir William was so
completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had but
just courage enough to make a very low bow, and take his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) seat
without saying a word; and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) daughter, frightened almost out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) senses, sat on the edge of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) chair, not knowing which way
to look. Elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene, and
could observe the three ladies before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) composedly. Lady
Catherine was a tall, large woman, with strongly-marked features,
which might once have been handsome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) air was not
conciliating, nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) manner of receiving them such as to
make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visitors forget their inferior rank. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not
rendered formidable by silence; but whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) said was spoken
in so authoritative a tone, as marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) self-importance, and
brought Mr. Wickham immediately to Elizabeth’s mind; and from the
observation of the day altogether, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) believed Lady Catherine to
be exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) represented.

<p/>When, after examining the mother, in whose countenance and
deportment she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) soon found some resemblance of Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
turned her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eyes on the daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) could almost have joined in
Maria’s astonishment at her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) being so thin and so small. There was
neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies. Miss
de Bourgh was pale and sickly; her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) features, though not plain,
were insignificant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) spoke very little, except in a low
voice, to Mrs. Jenkinson, in whose appearance there was nothing
remarkable, and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>)
said, and placing a screen in the proper direction before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>)
eyes.

<p/>After sitting a few minutes, they were all sent to one of the
windows to admire the view, Mr. Collins attending them to point
out its beauties, and Lady Catherine kindly informing them that
it was much better worth looking at in the summer.

<p/>The dinner was exceedingly handsome, and there were all the
servants and all the articles of plate which Mr. Collins had
promised; and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had likewise foretold, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) seat at
the bottom of the table, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship’s desire, and looked as
if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) felt that life could furnish nothing greater. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) carved,
and ate, and praised with delighted alacrity; and every dish was
commended, first by him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) and then by Sir William, who was now
enough recovered to echo whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) son-in-law said, in a
manner which Elizabeth wondered Lady Catherine could bear. But
Lady Catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration,
and gave most gracious smiles, especially when any dish on the
table proved a novelty to them. The party did not supply much
conversation. Elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an
opening, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was seated between Charlotte and Miss de
Bourgh—the former of whom was engaged in listening to Lady
Catherine, and the latter said not a word to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all dinner-time.
Mrs. Jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little Miss
de Bourgh ate, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) to try some other dish, and fearing
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bourgh</b></font>) was indisposed. Maria thought speaking out of the question,
and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire.

<p/>When the ladies returned to the drawing-room, there was little to
be done but to hear Lady Catherine talk, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did without
any intermission till coffee came in, delivering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opinion on
every subject in so decisive a manner, as proved that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not
used to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) judgement controverted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) enquired into
Charlotte’s domestic concerns familiarly and minutely, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) a
great deal of advice as to the management of them all; told her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as
hers, and instructed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as to the care of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cows and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
poultry. Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great
lady’s attention, which could furnish her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with an occasion of
dictating to others. In the intervals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) discourse with Mrs.
Collins, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) addressed a variety of questions to Maria and
Elizabeth, but especially to the latter, of whose connections she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
knew the least, and who she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) observed to Mrs. Collins was a very
genteel, pretty kind of girl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), at different times,
how many sisters she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had, whether they were older or younger than
herself, whether any of them were likely to be married, whether
they were handsome, where they had been educated, what carriage
her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) father kept, and what had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) mother’s maiden name?
Elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) questions but answered
them very composedly. Lady Catherine then observed,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your father’s estate is entailed on Mr. Collins, I think. For
your sake,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine</b></font>)</div>turning to Charlotte, "I am glad of it; but otherwise
I see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line. It
was not thought necessary in Sir Lewis de Bourgh’s family. Do you
play and sing, Miss Bennet?"

<p/>"A little."

<p/>"Oh! then—some time or other we shall be happy to hear you. Our
instrument is a capital one, probably superior to——You shall try
it some day. Do your sisters play and sing?"

<p/>"One of them does."

<p/>"Why did not you all learn? You ought all to have learned. The
Miss Webbs all play, and their father has not so good an income
as yours. Do you draw?"

<p/>"No, not at all."

<p/>"What, none of you?"

<p/>"Not one."

<p/>"That is very strange. But I suppose you had no opportunity. Your
mother should have taken you to town every spring for the benefit
of masters."

<p/>"My mother would have had no objection, but my father hates
London."

<p/>"Has your governess left you?"

<p/>"We never had any governess."

<p/>"No governess! How was that possible? Five daughters brought up
at home without a governess! I never heard of such a thing. Your
mother must have been quite a slave to your education.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could hardly help smiling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that had
not been the case.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Then, who taught you? who attended to you? Without a governess,
you must have been neglected."

<p/>"Compared with some families, I believe we were; but such of us
as wished to learn never wanted the means. We were always
encouraged to read, and had all the masters that were necessary.
Those who chose to be idle, certainly might."

<p/>"Aye, no doubt; but that is what a governess will prevent, and if
I had known your mother, I should have advised her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) most
strenuously to engage one. I always say that nothing is to be
done in education without steady and regular instruction, and
nobody but a governess can give it. It is wonderful how many
families I have been the means of supplying in that way. I am
always glad to get a young person well placed out. Four nieces of
Mrs. Jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means;
and it was but the other day that I recommended another young
person, who was merely accidentally mentioned to me, and the
family are quite delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>). Mrs. Collins, did I tell you
of Lady Metcalf’s calling yesterday to thank me? She (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) finds Miss
Pope a treasure. <div class="bookquote">‘Lady Catherine,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘you have given me a
treasure.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Are any of your younger sisters out, Miss Bennet?"

<p/>"Yes, ma’am, all."

<p/>"All! What, all five out at once? Very odd! And you only the
second. The younger ones out before the elder ones are married!
Your younger sisters must be very young?"

<p/>"Yes, my youngest is not sixteen. Perhaps _she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)_ is full young to
be much in company. But really, ma’am, I think it would be very
hard upon younger sisters, that they should not have their share
of society and amusement, because the elder may not have the
means or inclination to marry early. The last-born has as good a
right to the pleasures of youth as the first. And to be kept back
on _such_ a motive! I think it would not be very likely to
promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>sisters</b></font>) ladyship, "you give your opinion very
decidedly for so young a person. Pray, what is your age?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"With three younger sisters grown up,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth,
smiling, "your ladyship can hardly expect me to own it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lady Catherine seemed quite astonished at not receiving a direct
answer; and Elizabeth suspected herself to be the first creature
who had ever dared to trifle with so much dignified impertinence.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You cannot be more than twenty, I am sure, therefore you need
not conceal your age."

<p/>"I am not one-and-twenty."

<p/>When the gentlemen had joined them, and tea was over, the
card-tables were placed. Lady Catherine, Sir William, and Mr. and
Mrs. Collins sat down to quadrille; and as Miss de Bourgh chose
to play at cassino, the two girls had the honour of assisting
Mrs. Jenkinson to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>) party. Their table was
superlatively stupid. Scarcely a syllable was uttered that did
not relate to the game, except when Mrs. Jenkinson expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Jenkinson</b></font>)
fears of Miss de Bourgh’s being too hot or too cold, or having
too much or too little light. A great deal more passed at the
other table. Lady Catherine was generally speaking—stating the
mistakes of the three others, or relating some anecdote of
herself. Mr. Collins was employed in agreeing to everything her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ladyship said, thanking her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for every fish he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) won, and
apologising if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) won too many. Sir William did not
say much. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was storing his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) memory with anecdotes and noble
names.

<p/>When Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter had played as long as they
chose, the tables were broken up, the carriage was offered to
Mrs. Collins, gratefully accepted and immediately ordered. The
party then gathered round the fire to hear Lady Catherine
determine what weather they were to have on the morrow. From
these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the
coach; and with many speeches of thankfulness on Mr. Collins’s
side and as many bows on Sir William’s they departed. As soon as
they had driven from the door, Elizabeth was called on by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
cousin to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) opinion of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had seen at Rosings,
which, for Charlotte’s sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) made more favourable than it
really was. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) commendation, though costing her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) some
trouble, could by no means satisfy Mr. Collins, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was very
soon obliged to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) ladyship’s praise into his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own hands.
