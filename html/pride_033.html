<p/>More than once did Elizabeth, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ramble within the park,
unexpectedly meet Mr. Darcy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt all the perverseness of the
mischance that should bring him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) where no one else was brought,
and, to prevent its ever happening again, took care to inform him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers. How it could
occur a second time, therefore, was very odd! Yet it did, and
even a third. It seemed like wilful ill-nature, or a voluntary
penance, for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal
enquiries and an awkward pause and then away, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) actually
thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) never
said a great deal, nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) give herself the trouble of
talking or of listening much; but it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) in the course of
their third rencontre that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was asking some odd unconnected
questions—about her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) pleasure in being at Hunsford, her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) love of
solitary walks, and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) opinion of Mr. and Mrs. Collins’s
happiness; and that in speaking of Rosings and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) not perfectly
understanding the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed to expect that whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>)
came into Kent again she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) would be staying _there_ too. His (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) words
seemed to imply it. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) have Colonel Fitzwilliam in his (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>)
thoughts? She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) supposed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) meant anything, he (<font color='blue'><b>Kent</b></font>) must mean an
allusion to what might arise in that quarter. It distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) a
little, and she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the
pales opposite the Parsonage.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) was engaged one day as she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) walked, in perusing Jane’s last
letter, and dwelling on some passages which proved that Jane had
not written in spirits, when, instead of being again surprised by
Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw on looking up that Colonel Fitzwilliam was
meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Putting away the letter immediately and forcing a
smile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I did not know before that you ever walked this way."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I have been making the tour of the park,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied, "as I
generally do every year, and intend to close it with a call at
the Parsonage. Are you going much farther?"

<p/>"No, I should have turned in a moment.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And accordingly she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did turn, and they walked towards the
Parsonage together.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Kent</b></font>)</div>Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?" said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>"Yes—if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
disposal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arranges the business just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pleases."

<p/>"And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has at
least pleasure in the great power of choice. I do not know
anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) likes
than Mr. Darcy."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) likes to have his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own way very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>replied Colonel
Fitzwilliam. "But so we all do. It is only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) has better
means of having it than many others, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) is rich, and many
others are poor. I speak feelingly. A younger son, you know, must
be inured to self-denial and dependence."

<p/>"In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little
of either. Now seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial
and dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money
from going wherever you chose, or procuring anything you had a
fancy for?"

<p/>"These are home questions—and perhaps I cannot say that I have
experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of
greater weight, I may suffer from want of money. Younger sons
cannot marry where they like."

<p/>"Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very
often do."

<p/>"Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not
many in my rank of life who can afford to marry without some
attention to money."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>thought Elizabeth, "meant for me?<div class="bookquote">" and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coloured at
the idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, " (<font color='red'><b>an earl</b></font>)</div>And
pray, what is the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless
the elder brother is very sickly, I suppose you would not ask
above fifty thousand pounds."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in the same style, and the subject dropped. To
interrupt a silence which might make him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affected with
what had passed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon afterwards said:

<p/>"I imagine your cousin brought you down with him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) chiefly for the
sake of having someone at his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) disposal. I wonder he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) does not
marry, to secure a lasting convenience of that kind. But,
perhaps, his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sister does as well for the present, and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
under his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) sole care, he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may do what he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) likes with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>said Colonel Fitzwilliam, "that is an advantage which he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>)
must divide with me. I am joined with him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) in the guardianship of
Miss Darcy."

<p/>"Are you indeed? And pray what sort of guardians do you make?
Does your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) age
are sometimes a little difficult to manage, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has the
true Darcy spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may like to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own way."

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) observed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earnestly; and the
manner in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) immediately asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) why she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) supposed Miss
Darcy likely to give them any uneasiness, convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
had somehow or other got pretty near the truth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) directly
replied:

<p/>"You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); and I
dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is one of the most tractable creatures in the world.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is a very great favourite with some ladies of my
acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley. I think I have heard
you say that you know them."

<p/>"I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant gentlemanlike
man—he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is a great friend of Darcy’s."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth drily; "Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to
Mr. Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/>"Care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
in those points where he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) most wants care. From something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
told me in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley
very much indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). But I ought to beg his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) pardon, for I
have no right to suppose that Bingley was the person meant. It
was all conjecture."

<p/>"What is it you mean?"

<p/>"It is a circumstance which Darcy could not wish to be generally
known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family, it
would be an unpleasant thing."

<p/>"You may depend upon my not mentioning it."

<p/>"And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be
Bingley. What he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) told me was merely this: that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) congratulated
himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences
of a most imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any
other particulars, and I only suspected it to be Bingley from
believing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that
sort, and from knowing them to have been together the whole of
last summer."

<p/>"Did Mr. Darcy give you reasons for this interference?"

<p/>"I understood that there were some very strong objections against
the lady."

<p/>"And what arts did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) use to separate them?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) did not talk to me of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own arts,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam,
smiling. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only told me what I have now told you."

<p/>Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart swelling with
indignation. After watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a little, Fitzwilliam asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
why she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was so thoughtful.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am thinking of what you have been telling me,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). "Your
cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) to be the
judge?"

<p/>"You are rather disposed to call his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) interference officious?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend’s inclination, or why, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own judgement
alone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was to determine and direct in what manner his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend
was to be happy. But,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) continued, recollecting herself, "as
we know none of the particulars, it is not fair to condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).
It is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the
case."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is not an unnatural surmise,"  (<font color='red'><b>cousin</b></font>)</div>said Fitzwilliam, "but it is
a lessening of the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly."

<p/>This was spoken jestingly; but it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so just a
picture of Mr. Darcy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not trust herself with an
answer, and therefore, abruptly changing the conversation talked
on indifferent matters until they reached the Parsonage. There,
shut into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, as soon as their visitor left them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could think without interruption of all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard. It
was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than
those with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was connected. There could not exist in the
world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have such boundless
influence. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been concerned in the measures taken to
separate Bingley and Jane she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never doubted; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and
arrangement of them. If his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own vanity, however, did not mislead
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), _he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_ was the cause, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) pride and caprice were the cause, of
all that Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most
affectionate, generous heart in the world; and no one could say
how lasting an evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might have inflicted.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There were some very strong objections against the lady,"  (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>were
Colonel Fitzwilliam’s words; and those strong objections probably
were, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) having one uncle who was a country attorney, and
another who was in business in London.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To Jane herself,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) exclaimed, "there could be no possibility
of objection; all loveliness and goodness as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is!—her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
understanding excellent, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind improved, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) manners
captivating. Neither could anything be urged against my father,
who, though with some peculiarities, has abilities Mr. Darcy
himself need not disdain, and respectability which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will
probably never reach." When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
confidence gave way a little; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not allow that any
objections _there_ had material weight with Mr. Darcy, whose
pride, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from the
want of importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend’s connections, than from their
want of sense; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite decided, at last, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
been partly governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by
the wish of retaining Mr. Bingley for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister.

<p/>The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned, brought on
a headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening, that,
added to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
not to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to
drink tea. Mrs. Collins, seeing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was really unwell, did
not press her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to go and as much as possible prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) husband
from pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>); but Mr. Collins could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather displeased by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>)
staying at home.
