<p/>In consequence of an agreement between the sisters, Elizabeth
wrote the next morning to their mother, to beg that the carriage
might be sent for them in the course of the day. But Mrs. Bennet,
who had calculated on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters remaining at Netherfield till
the following Tuesday, which would exactly finish Jane’s week,
could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
answer, therefore, was not propitious, at least not to
Elizabeth’s wishes, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was impatient to get home. Mrs.
Bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the
carriage before Tuesday; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) postscript it was added, that
if Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister pressed them to stay longer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
could spare them very well. Against staying longer, however,
Elizabeth was positively resolved—nor did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) much expect it
would be asked; and fearful, on the contrary, as being considered
as intruding themselves needlessly long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) urged Jane to borrow
Mr. Bingley’s carriage immediately, and at length it was settled
that their original design of leaving Netherfield that morning
should be mentioned, and the request made.

<p/>The communication excited many professions of concern; and enough
was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day
to work on Jane; and till the morrow their going was deferred.
Miss Bingley was then sorry that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had proposed the delay, for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
affection for the other.

<p/>The master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to
go so soon, and repeatedly tried to persuade Miss Bennet that it
would not be safe for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)—that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was not enough recovered; but
Jane was firm where she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt herself to be right.

<p/>To Mr. Darcy it was welcome intelligence—Elizabeth had been at
Netherfield long enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attracted him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) liked—and
Miss Bingley was uncivil to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_, and more teasing than usual to
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no
sign of admiration should _now_ escape him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), nothing that could
elevate her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) with the hope of influencing his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) felicity; sensible
that if such an idea had been suggested, his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) behaviour during the
last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it.
Steady to his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) purpose, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) scarcely spoke ten words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) through
the whole of Saturday, and though they were at one time left by
themselves for half-an-hour, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) adhered most conscientiously to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) book, and would not even look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/>On Sunday, after morning service, the separation, so agreeable to
almost all, took place. Miss Bingley’s civility to Elizabeth
increased at last very rapidly, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) affection for
Jane; and when they parted, after assuring the latter of the
pleasure it would always give her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) either at Longbourn
or Netherfield, and embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) most tenderly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) even shook
hands with the former. Elizabeth took leave of the whole party in
the liveliest of spirits.

<p/>They were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother. Mrs.
Bennet wondered at their coming, and thought them very wrong to
give so much trouble, and was sure Jane would have caught cold
again. But their father, though very laconic in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) expressions
of pleasure, was really glad to see them; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had felt their
importance in the family circle. The evening conversation, when
they were all assembled, had lost much of its animation, and
almost all its sense by the absence of Jane and Elizabeth.

<p/>They found Mary, as usual, deep in the study of thorough-bass and
human nature; and had some extracts to admire, and some new
observations of threadbare morality to listen to. Catherine and
Lydia had information for them of a different sort. Much had been
done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding
Wednesday; several of the officers had dined lately with their
uncle, a private had been flogged, and it had actually been
hinted that Colonel Forster was going to be married.
