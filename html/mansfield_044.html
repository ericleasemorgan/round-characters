What Fanny told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of former times dwelt
more on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind than the pages of Goldsmith; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sister
the compliment of preferring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) style to that of any printed author.
The early habit of reading was wanting.

<p/>Their conversations, however, were not always on subjects so high as
history or morals. Others had their hour; and of lesser matters, none
returned so often, or remained so long between them, as Mansfield Park,
a description of the people, the manners, the amusements, the ways of
Mansfield Park. Susan, who had an innate taste for the genteel and
well-appointed, was eager to hear, and Fanny could not but indulge
herself in dwelling on so beloved a theme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped it was not wrong;
though, after a time, Susan’s very great admiration of everything said
or done in her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) uncle’s house, and earnest longing to go into
Northamptonshire, seemed almost to blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) for exciting feelings
which could not be gratified.

<p/>Poor Susan was very little better fitted for home than her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>) elder
sister; and as Fanny grew thoroughly to understand this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) began to
feel that when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own release from Portsmouth came, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness
would have a material drawback in leaving Susan behind. That a girl so
capable of being made everything good should be left in such hands,
distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) more and more. Were _she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ likely to have a home to
invite her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to, what a blessing it would be! And had it been possible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to return Mr. Crawford’s regard, the probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being
very far from objecting to such a measure would have been the greatest
increase of all her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own comforts. She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was really
good-tempered, and could fancy his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entering into a plan of that sort
most pleasantly.
