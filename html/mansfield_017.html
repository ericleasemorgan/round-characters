<p/>It was, indeed, a triumphant day to Mr. Bertram and Maria. Such a
victory over Edmund’s discretion had been beyond their hopes, and was
most delightful. There was no longer anything to disturb them in their
darling project, and they congratulated each other in private on the
jealous weakness to which they attributed the change, with all the glee
of feelings gratified in every way. Edmund might still look grave, and
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not like the scheme in general, and must disapprove the play
in particular; their point was gained: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was to act, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was driven
to it by the force of selfish inclinations only. Edmund had descended
from that moral elevation which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had maintained before, and they were
both as much the better as the happier for the descent.

<p/>They behaved very well, however, to _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ on the occasion, betraying no
exultation beyond the lines about the corners of the mouth, and seemed
to think it as great an escape to be quit of the intrusion of Charles
Maddox, as if they had been forced into admitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>) against their
inclination. <div class="bookquote">"To have it quite in their own family circle was what they
had particularly wished. A stranger among them would have been the
destruction of all their comfort" (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>; and when Edmund, pursuing that idea,
gave a hint of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hope as to the limitation of the audience, they were
ready, in the complaisance of the moment, to promise anything. It was
all good-humour and encouragement. Mrs. Norris offered to contrive his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
dress, Mr. Yates assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) that Anhalt’s last scene with the Baron
admitted a good deal of action and emphasis, and Mr. Rushworth
undertook to count his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) speeches.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Tom</b></font>)</div>said Tom, "Fanny may be more disposed to oblige us now.
Perhaps you may persuade _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_."

<p/>"No, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is quite determined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly will not act."

<p/>"Oh! very well." And not another word was said; but Fanny felt herself
again in danger, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) indifference to the danger was beginning to
fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) already.

<p/>There were not fewer smiles at the Parsonage than at the Park on this
change in Edmund; Miss Crawford looked very lovely in hers, and entered
with such an instantaneous renewal of cheerfulness into the whole
affair as could have but one effect on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was certainly right in
respecting such feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had determined on it."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And the
morning wore away in satisfactions very sweet, if not very sound. One
advantage resulted from it to Fanny: at the earnest request of Miss
Crawford, Mrs. Grant had, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) usual good-humour, agreed to
undertake the part for which Fanny had been wanted; and this was all
that occurred to gladden _her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ heart during the day; and even this,
when imparted by Edmund, brought a pang with it, for it was Miss
Crawford to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was obliged—it was Miss Crawford whose kind
exertions were to excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) gratitude, and whose merit in making them
was spoken of with a glow of admiration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was safe; but peace and
safety were unconnected here. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind had been never farther from
peace. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had done wrong herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was
disquieted in every other way. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) judgment were equally
against Edmund’s decision: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not acquit his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) unsteadiness, and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) happiness under it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) wretched. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was full of jealousy and
agitation. Miss Crawford came with looks of gaiety which seemed an
insult, with friendly expressions towards herself which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could
hardly answer calmly. Everybody around her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was gay and busy, prosperous
and important; each had their object of interest, their part, their
dress, their favourite scene, their friends and confederates: all were
finding employment in consultations and comparisons, or diversion in
the playful conceits they suggested. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) alone was sad and
insignificant: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had no share in anything; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might go or stay; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
might be in the midst of their noise, or retreat from it to the
solitude of the East room, without being seen or missed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could
almost think anything would have been preferable to this. Mrs. Grant
was of consequence: _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_ good-nature had honourable mention; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) taste
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) time were considered; her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) presence was wanted; she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was sought
for, and attended, and praised; and Fanny was at first in some danger
of envying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the character she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had accepted. But reflection brought
better feelings, and shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) that Mrs. Grant was entitled to
respect, which could never have belonged to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)_; and that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
received even the greatest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could never have been easy in joining a
scheme which, considering only her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) uncle, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) must condemn altogether.

<p/>Fanny’s heart was not absolutely the only saddened one amongst them, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon began to acknowledge to herself. Julia was a sufferer too,
though not quite so blamelessly.

<p/>Henry Crawford had trifled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) feelings; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) had very long
allowed and even sought his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions, with a jealousy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister
so reasonable as ought to have been their cure; and now that the
conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) preference for Maria had been forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
submitted to it without any alarm for Maria’s situation, or any
endeavour at rational tranquillity for herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) either sat in
gloomy silence, wrapt in such gravity as nothing could subdue, no
curiosity touch, no wit amuse; or allowing the attentions of Mr. Yates,
was talking with forced gaiety to him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) alone, and ridiculing the acting
of the others.

<p/>For a day or two after the affront was given, Henry Crawford had
endeavoured to do it away by the usual attack of gallantry and
compliment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not cared enough about it to persevere against a
few repulses; and becoming soon too busy with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) play to have time for
more than one flirtation, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) grew indifferent to the quarrel, or rather
thought it a lucky occurrence, as quietly putting an end to what might
ere long have raised expectations in more than Mrs. Grant. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was not
pleased to see Julia excluded from the play, and sitting by
disregarded; but as it was not a matter which really involved her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
happiness, as Henry must be the best judge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) did
assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), with a most persuasive smile, that neither he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) nor Julia had
ever had a serious thought of each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) could only renew her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
former caution as to the elder sister, entreat him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) not to risk his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
tranquillity by too much admiration there, and then gladly take her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
share in anything that brought cheerfulness to the young people in
general, and that did so particularly promote the pleasure of the two
so dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I rather wonder Julia is not in love with Henry,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) observation
to Mary.

<p/>"I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) is," replied Mary coldly. <div class="bookquote">"I imagine both sisters are."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Both! no, no, that must not be. Do not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) a hint of it. Think of
Mr. Rushworth!"

<p/>"You had better tell Miss Bertram to think of Mr. Rushworth. It may do
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_ some good. I often think of Mr. Rushworth’s property and
independence, and wish them in other hands; but I never think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>). A
man might represent the county with such an estate; a man might escape
a profession and represent the county."

<p/>"I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) _will_ be in parliament soon. When Sir Thomas comes, I
dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) will be in for some borough, but there has been nobody to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the way of doing anything yet."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Sir Thomas is to achieve many mighty things when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes home,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said
Mary, after a pause. "Do you remember Hawkins Browne’s <div class="bookquote">‘Address to
Tobacco,’  (<font color='red'><b>Hawkins Browne</b></font>)</div>in imitation of Pope?—

<p/>Blest leaf! whose aromatic gales dispense
To Templars modesty, to Parsons sense.


<p/>I will parody them—

<p/>Blest Knight! whose dictatorial looks dispense
To Children affluence, to Rushworth sense.


<p/>Will not that do, Mrs. Grant? Everything seems to depend upon Sir
Thomas’s return."

<p/>"You will find his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) consequence very just and reasonable when you see
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) family, I assure you. I do not think we do so well without
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) has a fine dignified manner, which suits the head of such a
house, and keeps everybody in their place. Lady Bertram seems more of a
cipher now than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) is at home; and nobody else can keep Mrs.
Norris in order. But, Mary, do not fancy that Maria Bertram cares for
Henry. I am sure _Julia_ does not, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) would not have flirted as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
did last night with Mr. Yates; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) and Maria are very good
friends, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) likes Sotherton too well to be inconstant."

<p/>"I would not give much for Mr. Rushworth’s chance if Henry stept in
before the articles were signed."

<p/>"If you have such a suspicion, something must be done; and as soon as
the play is all over, we will talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) seriously and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) know
his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) own mind; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) means nothing, we will send him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) off, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
is Henry, for a time."

<p/>Julia _did_ suffer, however, though Mrs. Grant discerned it not, and
though it escaped the notice of many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) own family likewise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
had loved, she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) did love still, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had all the suffering which a
warm temper and a high spirit were likely to endure under the
disappointment of a dear, though irrational hope, with a strong sense
of ill-usage. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) heart was sore and angry, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was capable only of
angry consolations. The sister with whom she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was used to be on easy
terms was now become her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) greatest enemy: they were alienated from each
other; and Julia was not superior to the hope of some distressing end
to the attentions which were still carrying on there, some punishment
to Maria for conduct so shameful towards herself as well as towards Mr.
Rushworth. With no material fault of temper, or difference of opinion,
to prevent their being very good friends while their interests were the
same, the sisters, under such a trial as this, had not affection or
principle enough to make them merciful or just, to give them honour or
compassion. Maria felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) triumph, and pursued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) purpose, careless
of Julia; and Julia could never see Maria distinguished by Henry
Crawford without trusting that it would create jealousy, and bring a
public disturbance at last.

<p/>Fanny saw and pitied much of this in Julia; but there was no outward
fellowship between them. Julia made no communication, and Fanny took no
liberties. They were two solitary sufferers, or connected only by
Fanny’s consciousness.

<p/>The inattention of the two brothers and the aunt to Julia’s
discomposure, and their blindness to its true cause, must be imputed to
the fullness of their own minds. They were totally preoccupied. Tom was
engrossed by the concerns of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) theatre, and saw nothing that did not
immediately relate to it. Edmund, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) theatrical and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) real
part, between Miss Crawford’s claims and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own conduct, between love
and consistency, was equally unobservant; and Mrs. Norris was too busy
in contriving and directing the general little matters of the company,
superintending their various dresses with economical expedient, for
which nobody thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), and saving, with delighted integrity, half a
crown here and there to the absent Sir Thomas, to have leisure for
watching the behaviour, or guarding the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) daughters.
