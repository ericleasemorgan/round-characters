<p/>Mrs. Palmer was so well at the end of a fortnight, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother felt
it no longer necessary to give up the whole of her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) time to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>); and,
contenting herself with visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) once or twice a day, returned from
that period to her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own home, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own habits, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) found the
Miss Dashwoods very ready to resume their former share.

<p/>About the third or fourth morning after their being thus resettled in
Berkeley Street, Mrs. Jennings, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) ordinary visit to
Mrs. Palmer, entered the drawing-room, where Elinor was sitting by
herself, with an air of such hurrying importance as prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
hear something wonderful; and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) time only to form that idea,
began directly to justify it, by saying,

<p/>"Lord! my dear Miss Dashwood! have you heard the news?"

<p/>"No, ma’am. What is it?"

<p/>"Something so strange! But you shall hear it all. When I got to Mr.
Palmer’s, I found Charlotte quite in a fuss about the child. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was
sure it was very ill—it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples.
So I looked at it directly, and, <div class="bookquote">‘Lord! my dear,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">‘it is
nothing in the world, but the red gum;’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and nurse said just the same.
But Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for;
and luckily he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) happened to just come in from Harley Street, so he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>)
stepped over directly, and as soon as ever he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) saw the child, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) said
just as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, and
then Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) was going away again, it
came into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think of
it, but it came into my head to ask him (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) if there was any news. So upon
that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to know
something or other, and at last he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) said in a whisper, <div class="bookquote">‘For fear any
unpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as to
their sister’s indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that I
believe there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood will
do very well.’ (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>"What! is Fanny ill?"

<p/>"That is exactly what I said, my dear. <div class="bookquote">‘Lord!’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>says I, <div class="bookquote">‘is Mrs.
Dashwood ill?’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>So then it all came out; and the long and the short of
the matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars,
the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as it
turns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr.
Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to my
cousin Lucy!—There’s for you, my dear! And not a creature knowing a
syllable of the matter, except Nancy! Could you have believed such a
thing possible? There is no great wonder in their liking one another;
but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobody
suspect it! _That_ is strange! I never happened to see them together,
or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so this was
kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) nor your
brother or sister suspected a word of the matter: till this very
morning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but no
conjurer, popt it all out. <div class="bookquote">‘Lord!’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thinks she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) to herself, <div class="bookquote">‘they are all
so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and
so, away she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
carpet-work, little suspecting what was to come—for she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had just been
saying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought to
make a match between Edward and some Lord’s daughter or other, I forget
who. So you may think what a blow it was to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) vanity and pride.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams as
reached your brother’s ears, as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was sitting in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own dressing-room
down stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) steward in the
country. So up he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, for
Lucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on.
Poor soul! I pity _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_. And I must say, I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was used very
hardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) into
a fainting fit. Nancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) fell upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) knees, and cried bitterly; and
your brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) walked about the room, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not know what
to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minute longer in
the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon _his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)_ knees too,
to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) to let them stay till they had packed up their clothes.
_Then_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) fell into hysterics again, and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was so frightened that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan found the house in all this
uproar. The carriage was at the door ready to take my poor cousins
away, and they were just stepping in as he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) came off; poor Lucy in such
a condition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) says, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could hardly walk; and Nancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nancy</b></font>) was almost
as bad. I declare, I have no patience with your sister; and I hope,
with all my heart, it will be a match in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Lord! what a
taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hears of it! To have his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) love
used so scornfully! for they say he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is monstrous fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), as well
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) may. I should not wonder, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was to be in the greatest
passion!—and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) and I had a great
deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) is gone back
again to Harley Street, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Donavan</b></font>) may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is
told of it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was sent for as soon as ever my cousins left the
house, for your sister was sure _she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)_ would be in hysterics too; and so
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. I have no
notion of people’s making such a to-do about money and greatness. There
is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy should not marry; for I
am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son, and though
Lucy has next to nothing herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) knows better than any body how to
make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only
allow him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) five hundred a-year, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) would make as good an appearance
with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might
live in such another cottage as yours—or a little bigger—with two
maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them to a housemaid, for
my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fit them exactly."

<p/>Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collect
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was able to give such an answer, and make such
observations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce.
Happy to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not suspected of any extraordinary interest
in it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had of late often hoped might be the
case) had ceased to imagine her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) at all attached to Edward; and happy
above all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt very well able
to speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) judgment,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every one
concerned in it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could hardly determine what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own expectation of its event really
was; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its being
possible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward and
Lucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be a
doubt of its nature, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was anxious to hear; and still more anxious to
know how Edward would conduct himself. For _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) felt much
compassion;—for Lucy very little—and it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) some pains to procure
that little;—for the rest of the party none at all.

<p/>As Mrs. Jennings could talk on no other subject, Elinor soon saw the
necessity of preparing Marianne for its discussion. No time was to be
lost in undeceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acquainted with the real truth,
and in endeavouring to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to hear it talked of by others,
without betraying that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt any uneasiness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, or any
resentment against Edward.

<p/>Elinor’s office was a painful one.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to remove what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
really believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s chief consolation,—to give such
particulars of Edward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared would ruin him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) for ever in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) good
opinion,-and to make Marianne, by a resemblance in their situations,
which to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ fancy would seem strong, feel all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own disappointment
over again. But unwelcome as such a task must be, it was necessary to
be done, and Elinor therefore hastened to perform it.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was very far from wishing to dwell on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own feelings, or to
represent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as the
self-command she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had practised since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first knowledge of Edward’s
engagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be given
without emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, nor
impetuous grief. _That_ belonged rather to the hearer, for Marianne
listened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be the
comforter of others in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own distresses, no less than in theirs; and
all the comfort that could be given by assurances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own composure
of mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge but
of imprudence, was readily offered.

<p/>But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemed
a second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) _had_
loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) most sincerely, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feel less than herself! As for Lucy
Steele, she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) so totally unamiable, so absolutely
incapable of attaching a sensible man, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) could not be persuaded
at first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection of
Edward for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) would not even admit it to have been natural; and
Elinor left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to be convinced that it was so, by that which only
could convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), a better knowledge of mankind.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first communication had reached no farther than to state the fact
of the engagement, and the length of time it had existed.—Marianne’s
feelings had then broken in, and put an end to all regularity of
detail; and for some time all that could be done was to soothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
distress, lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) alarms, and combat her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resentment. The first
question on her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) side, which led to farther particulars, was,—

<p/>"How long has this been known to you, Elinor? has he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) written to you?"

<p/>"I have known it these four months. When Lucy first came to Barton Park
last November, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) told me in confidence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) engagement."

<p/>At these words, Marianne’s eyes expressed the astonishment which her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
lips could not utter. After a pause of wonder, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) exclaimed—

<p/>"Four months!—Have you known of this four months?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor confirmed it.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What! while attending me in all my misery, has this been on your
heart? And I have reproached you for being happy!"

<p/>"It was not fit that you should then know how much I was the reverse!"

<p/>"Four months!<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne again. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>So calm! so cheerful! How have
you been supported?"

<p/>"By feeling that I was doing my duty.—My promise to Lucy, obliged me to
be secret. I owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), therefore, to avoid giving any hint of the
truth; and I owed it to my family and friends, not to create in them a
solicitude about me, which it could not be in my power to satisfy.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne seemed much struck.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have very often wished to undeceive yourself and my mother," added
Elinor; "and once or twice I have attempted it;—but without betraying
my trust, I never could have convinced you."

<p/>"Four months! and yet you loved him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>)!"

<p/>"Yes. But I did not love only him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>); and while the comfort of others was
dear to me, I was glad to spare them from knowing how much I felt. Now,
I can think and speak of it with little emotion. I would not have you
suffer on my account; for I assure you I no longer suffer materially
myself. I have many things to support me. I am not conscious of having
provoked the disappointment by any imprudence of my own, I have borne
it as much as possible without spreading it farther. I acquit Edward of
essential misconduct. I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) very happy; and I am so sure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
always doing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) duty, that though now he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) may harbour some regret, in
the end he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) must become so. Lucy does not want sense, and that is the
foundation on which every thing good may be built. And after all,
Marianne, after all that is bewitching in the idea of a single and
constant attachment, and all that can be said of one’s happiness
depending entirely on any particular person, it is not meant—it is not
fit—it is not possible that it should be so. Edward will marry Lucy; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
will marry a woman superior in person and understanding to half her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
sex; and time and habit will teach him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to forget that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever thought
another superior to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)_."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If such is your way of thinking,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "if the loss of what
is most valued is so easily to be made up by something else, your
resolution, your self-command, are, perhaps, a little less to be
wondered at.—They are brought more within my comprehension."

<p/>"I understand you. You do not suppose that I have ever felt much. For
four months, Marianne, I have had all this hanging on my mind, without
being at liberty to speak of it to a single creature; knowing that it
would make you and my mother most unhappy whenever it were explained to
you, yet unable to prepare you for it in the least. It was told me,—it
was in a manner forced on me by the very person herself, whose prior
engagement ruined all my prospects; and told me, as I thought, with
triumph. This person’s suspicions, therefore, I have had to oppose, by
endeavouring to appear indifferent where I have been most deeply
interested; and it has not been only once; I have had her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) hopes and
exultation to listen to again and again. I have known myself to be
divided from Edward for ever, without hearing one circumstance that
could make me less desire the connection. Nothing has proved him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
unworthy; nor has anything declared him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) indifferent to me.  I have had
to contend against the unkindness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, and the insolence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother; and have suffered the punishment of an attachment, without
enjoying its advantages. And all this has been going on at a time,
when, as you know too well, it has not been my only unhappiness. If you
can think me capable of ever feeling, surely you may suppose that I
have suffered _now_. The composure of mind with which I have brought
myself at present to consider the matter, the consolation that I have
been willing to admit, have been the effect of constant and painful
exertion; they did not spring up of themselves; they did not occur to
relieve my spirits at first. No, Marianne. _Then_, if I had not been
bound to silence, perhaps nothing could have kept me entirely—not even
what I owed to my dearest friends—from openly showing that I was _very_
unhappy.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne was quite subdued.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! Elinor," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, "you have made me hate myself for ever.—How
barbarous have I been to you!—you, who have been my only comfort, who
have borne with me in all my misery, who have seemed to be only
suffering for me!—Is this my gratitude?—Is this the only return I can
make you?—Because your merit cries out upon myself, I have been trying
to do it away."

<p/>The tenderest caresses followed this confession. In such a frame of
mind as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was now in, Elinor had no difficulty in obtaining from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
whatever promise she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) required; and at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) request, Marianne engaged
never to speak of the affair to any one with the least appearance of
bitterness; to meet Lucy without betraying the smallest increase of
dislike to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); and even to see Edward himself, if chance should bring
them together, without any diminution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) usual cordiality. These
were great concessions; but where Marianne felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had injured,
no reparation could be too much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to make.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) performed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promise of being discreet, to admiration.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
attended to all that Mrs. Jennings had to say upon the subject, with an
unchanging complexion, dissented from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) in nothing, and was heard
three times to say, <div class="bookquote">"Yes, ma’am." (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>—She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) praise of Lucy
with only moving from one chair to another, and when Mrs. Jennings
talked of Edward’s affection, it cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only a spasm in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
throat.—Such advances towards heroism in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister, made Elinor feel
equal to any thing herself.

<p/>The next morning brought a farther trial of it, in a visit from their
brother, who came with a most serious aspect to talk over the dreadful
affair, and bring them news of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have heard, I suppose,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with great solemnity, as soon as
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was seated, "of the very shocking discovery that took place under
our roof yesterday."

<p/>They all looked their assent; it seemed too awful a moment for speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued, "has suffered dreadfully. Mrs. Ferrars
too—in short it has been a scene of such complicated distress—but I
will hope that the storm may be weathered without our being any of us
quite overcome. Poor Fanny! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in hysterics all yesterday. But I
would not alarm you too much. Donavan says there is nothing materially
to be apprehended; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) constitution is a good one, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolution
equal to any thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has borne it all, with the fortitude of an
angel! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never shall think well of anybody again; and one
cannot wonder at it, after being so deceived!—meeting with such
ingratitude, where so much kindness had been shown, so much confidence
had been placed! It was quite out of the benevolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had asked these young women to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) house; merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behaved
girls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wished
very much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while your
kind friend there, was attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter. And now to be so
rewarded! <div class="bookquote">‘I wish, with all my heart,’  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>says poor Fanny in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affectionate way, <div class="bookquote">‘that we had asked your sisters instead of them.’ (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) stopped to be thanked; which being done, he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) went on.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ferrars</b></font>)</div>What poor Mrs. Ferrars suffered, when first Fanny broke it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), is
not to be described. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) with the truest affection had been
planning a most eligible connection for him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), was it to be supposed that
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could be all the time secretly engaged to another person!—such a
suspicion could never have entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) head! If she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) suspected _any_
prepossession elsewhere, it could not be in _that_ quarter. <div class="bookquote">‘_There_,
to be sure,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">‘I might have thought myself safe.’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
quite in an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should be
done, and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) determined to send for Edward. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) came. But I am
sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say to make
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may well suppose
by my arguments, and Fanny’s entreaties, was of no avail. Duty,
affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edward so
stubborn, so unfeeling before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother explained to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) liberal
designs, in case of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) marrying Miss Morton; told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would settle
on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good
thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grew desperate, to make it
twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) still persisted in
this low connection, represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the certain penury that must
attend the match. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own two thousand pounds she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) protested should be
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) all; she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would never see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) again; and so far would she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) be from
affording him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) the smallest assistance, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were to enter into
any profession with a view of better support, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) would do all in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
power to prevent him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) advancing in it."

<p/>Here Marianne, in an ecstasy of indignation, clapped her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hands
together, and cried, "Gracious God! can this be possible!"

<p/>"Well may you wonder, Marianne,<div class="bookquote">" replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) brother, " (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>at the obstinacy
which could resist such arguments as these. Your exclamation is very
natural.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne was going to retort, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) promises, and
forbore.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>All this, however," he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) continued, "was urged in vain. Edward said very
little; but what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did say, was in the most determined manner. Nothing
should prevail on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to give up his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would stand to it,
cost him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) what it might."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Then,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Jennings with blunt sincerity, no longer able to be
silent, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has acted like an honest man! I beg your pardon, Mr.
Dashwood, but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had done otherwise, I should have thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) a
rascal. I have some little concern in the business, as well as
yourself, for Lucy Steele is my cousin, and I believe there is not a
better kind of girl in the world, nor one who more deserves a good
husband."

<p/>John Dashwood was greatly astonished; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) nature was calm, not open
to provocation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) never wished to offend anybody, especially
anybody of good fortune. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) therefore replied, without any resentment,

<p/>"I would by no means speak disrespectfully of any relation of yours,
madam. Miss Lucy Steele is, I dare say, a very deserving young woman,
but in the present case you know, the connection must be impossible.
And to have entered into a secret engagement with a young man under her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)
uncle’s care, the son of a woman especially of such very large fortune
as Mrs. Ferrars, is perhaps, altogether a little extraordinary. In
short, I do not mean to reflect upon the behaviour of any person whom
you have a regard for, Mrs. Jennings. We all wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) extremely happy;
and Mrs. Ferrars’s conduct throughout the whole, has been such as every
conscientious, good mother, in like circumstances, would adopt. It has
been dignified and liberal. Edward has drawn his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own lot, and I fear it
will be a bad one.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne sighed out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) similar apprehension; and Elinor’s heart wrung
for the feelings of Edward, while braving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother’s threats, for a
woman who could not reward him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>Well, sir," said Mrs. Jennings, "and how did it end?"

<p/>"I am sorry to say, ma’am, in a most unhappy rupture:—Edward is
dismissed for ever from his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother’s notice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) house
yesterday, but where he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is gone, or whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is still in town, I do
not know; for _we_ of course can make no inquiry."

<p/>"Poor young man!—and what is to become of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?"

<p/>"What, indeed, ma’am! It is a melancholy consideration. Born to the
prospect of such affluence! I cannot conceive a situation more
deplorable. The interest of two thousand pounds—how can a man live on
it?—and when to that is added the recollection, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might, but for
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own folly, within three months have been in the receipt of two
thousand, five hundred a-year (for Miss Morton has thirty thousand
pounds,) I cannot picture to myself a more wretched condition. We must
all feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); and the more so, because it is totally out of our
power to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/>"Poor young man!" cried Mrs. Jennings, "I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be very
welcome to bed and board at my house; and so I would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) if I
could see him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). It is not fit that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be living about at his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own
charge now, at lodgings and taverns.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor’s heart thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for such kindness towards Edward, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
could not forbear smiling at the form of it.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>If he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would only have done as well by himself," said John Dashwood,
"as all his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) friends were disposed to do by him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might now have been
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) proper situation, and would have wanted for nothing. But as it
is, it must be out of anybody’s power to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). And there is one
thing more preparing against him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), which must be worse than all—his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
mother has determined, with a very natural kind of spirit, to settle
_that_ estate upon Robert immediately, which might have been Edward’s,
on proper conditions. I left her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) this morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) lawyer, talking
over the business."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, "that is _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)_ revenge. Everybody has a way
of their own. But I don’t think mine would be, to make one son
independent, because another had plagued me.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne got up and walked about the room.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Can anything be more galling to the spirit of a man," continued John,
"than to see his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) younger brother in possession of an estate which might
have been his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) own? Poor Edward! I feel for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sincerely."

<p/>A few minutes more spent in the same kind of effusion, concluded his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
visit; and with repeated assurances to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sisters that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really
believed there was no material danger in Fanny’s indisposition, and
that they need not therefore be very uneasy about it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went away;
leaving the three ladies unanimous in their sentiments on the present
occasion, as far at least as it regarded Mrs. Ferrars’s conduct, the
Dashwoods’, and Edward’s.

<p/>Marianne’s indignation burst forth as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) quitted the room; and
as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) vehemence made reserve impossible in Elinor, and unnecessary in
Mrs. Jennings, they all joined in a very spirited critique upon the
party.
