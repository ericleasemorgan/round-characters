<p/>Miss Crawford’s uneasiness was much lightened by this conversation, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) walked home again in spirits which might have defied almost another
week of the same small party in the same bad weather, had they been put
to the proof; but as that very evening brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother down from
London again in quite, or more than quite, his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) usual cheerfulness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
had nothing farther to try her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) still refusing to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) what
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had gone for was but the promotion of gaiety; a day before it might
have irritated, but now it was a pleasant joke—suspected only of
concealing something planned as a pleasant surprise to herself. And the
next day _did_ bring a surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Henry had said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) should just
go and ask the Bertrams how they did, and be back in ten minutes, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was gone above an hour; and when his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister, who had been waiting
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to walk with her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the garden, met him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at last most
impatiently in the sweep, and cried out, <div class="bookquote">"My dear Henry, where can you
have been all this time?"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had only to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had been sitting
with Lady Bertram and Fanny.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Sitting with them an hour and a half!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Mary.

<p/>But this was only the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) surprise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, Mary,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), drawing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm within his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and walking along the
sweep as if not knowing where he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was: "I could not get away sooner;
Fanny looked so lovely! I am quite determined, Mary. My mind is
entirely made up. Will it astonish you? No: you must be aware that I am
quite determined to marry Fanny Price."

<p/>The surprise was now complete; for, in spite of whatever his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
consciousness might suggest, a suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) having any such views
had never entered his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) sister’s imagination; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) looked so truly the
astonishment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was obliged to repeat what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had said,
and more fully and more solemnly. The conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) determination
once admitted, it was not unwelcome. There was even pleasure with the
surprise. Mary was in a state of mind to rejoice in a connexion with
the Bertram family, and to be not displeased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother’s
marrying a little beneath him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, Mary,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>was Henry’s concluding assurance. "I am fairly caught. You
know with what idle designs I began; but this is the end of them. I
have, I flatter myself, made no inconsiderable progress in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
affections; but my own are entirely fixed."

<p/>"Lucky, lucky girl!" cried Mary, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could speak; "what a
match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)! My dearest Henry, this must be my _first_ feeling; but
my _second_, which you shall have as sincerely, is, that I approve your
choice from my soul, and foresee your happiness as heartily as I wish
and desire it. You will have a sweet little wife; all gratitude and
devotion. Exactly what you deserve. What an amazing match for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)! Mrs.
Norris often talks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) luck; what will she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) say now? The delight of
all the family, indeed! And she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has some _true_ friends in it! How
_they_ will rejoice! But tell me all about it! Talk to me for ever.
When did you begin to think seriously about her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Nothing could be more impossible than to answer such a question, though
nothing could be more agreeable than to have it asked. " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>How the
pleasing plague had stolen on him (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)" he (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could not say; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had
expressed the same sentiment with a little variation of words three
times over, his (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sister eagerly interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) with, "Ah, my dear
Henry, and this is what took you to London! This was your business! You
chose to consult the Admiral before you made up your mind."

<p/>But this he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) stoutly denied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) knew his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) uncle too well to consult him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
on any matrimonial scheme. The Admiral hated marriage, and thought it
never pardonable in a young man of independent fortune.

<p/>"When Fanny is known to him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>),<div class="bookquote">" continued Henry, " (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will doat on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exactly the woman to do away every prejudice of such a man as
the Admiral, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is exactly such a woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) thinks does not
exist in the world. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is the very impossibility he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would describe, if
indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) has now delicacy of language enough to embody his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) own ideas.
But till it is absolutely settled—settled beyond all interference, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
shall know nothing of the matter. No, Mary, you are quite mistaken. You
have not discovered my business yet."

<p/>"Well, well, I am satisfied. I know now to whom it must relate, and am
in no hurry for the rest. Fanny Price! wonderful, quite wonderful! That
Mansfield should have done so much for—that _you_ should have found
your fate in Mansfield! But you are quite right; you could not have
chosen better. There is not a better girl in the world, and you do not
want for fortune; and as to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) connexions, they are more than good.
The Bertrams are undoubtedly some of the first people in this country.
She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) is niece to Sir Thomas Bertram; that will be enough for the world.
But go on, go on. Tell me more. What are your plans? Does she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) know her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
own happiness?"

<p/>"No."

<p/>"What are you waiting for?"

<p/>"For—for very little more than opportunity. Mary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) is not like her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
cousins; but I think I shall not ask in vain."

<p/>"Oh no! you cannot. Were you even less pleasing—supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not to
love you already (of which, however, I can have little doubt)—you would
be safe. The gentleness and gratitude of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) disposition would secure
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) all your own immediately. From my soul I do not think she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would
marry you _without_ love; that is, if there is a girl in the world
capable of being uninfluenced by ambition, I can suppose it her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); but
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to love you, and she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) will never have the heart to refuse."

<p/>As soon as her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) eagerness could rest in silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was as happy to tell
as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could be to listen; and a conversation followed almost as deeply
interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) as to himself, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had in fact nothing to
relate but his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own sensations, nothing to dwell on but Fanny’s charms.
Fanny’s beauty of face and figure, Fanny’s graces of manner and
goodness of heart, were the exhaustless theme. The gentleness, modesty,
and sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) character were warmly expatiated on; that
sweetness which makes so essential a part of every woman’s worth in the
judgment of man, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sometimes loves where it is not, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can
never believe it absent. Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) temper he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had good reason to depend on and
to praise. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had often seen it tried. Was there one of the family,
excepting Edmund, who had not in some way or other continually
exercised her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) patience and forbearance? Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) affections were evidently
strong. To see her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) brother! What could more delightfully prove
that the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart was equal to its gentleness? What could be
more encouraging to a man who had her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) love in view? Then, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
understanding was beyond every suspicion, quick and clear; and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
manners were the mirror of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own modest and elegant mind. Nor was
this all. Henry Crawford had too much sense not to feel the worth of
good principles in a wife, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was too little accustomed to
serious reflection to know them by their proper name; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
talked of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) having such a steadiness and regularity of conduct, such
a high notion of honour, and such an observance of decorum as might
warrant any man in the fullest dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) faith and integrity,
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) expressed what was inspired by the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being well
principled and religious.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I could so wholly and absolutely confide in her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); "and _that_
is what I want."

<p/>Well might his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, believing as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) really did that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) opinion of
Fanny Price was scarcely beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) merits, rejoice in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) prospects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The more I think of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, "the more am I convinced that you
are doing quite right; and though I should never have selected Fanny
Price as the girl most likely to attach you, I am now persuaded she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
the very one to make you happy. Your wicked project upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) peace
turns out a clever thought indeed. You will both find your good in it."

<p/>"It was bad, very bad in me against such a creature; but I did not know
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shall have no reason to lament the hour that first
put it into my head. I will make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) very happy, Mary; happier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
has ever yet been herself, or ever seen anybody else. I will not take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from Northamptonshire. I shall let Everingham, and rent a place in
this neighbourhood; perhaps Stanwix Lodge. I shall let a seven years’
lease of Everingham. I am sure of an excellent tenant at half a word. I
could name three people now, who would give me my own terms and thank
me."

<p/>"Ha!" cried Mary; "settle in Northamptonshire! That is pleasant! Then
we shall be all together.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spoken it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) recollected herself, and wished it unsaid;
but there was no need of confusion; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) brother saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) only as the
supposed inmate of Mansfield parsonage, and replied but to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
in the kindest manner to his (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>) own house, and to claim the best right in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You must give us more than half your time," said he (<font color='blue'><b>inmate</b></font>). "I cannot admit
Mrs. Grant to have an equal claim with Fanny and myself, for we shall
both have a right in you. Fanny will be so truly your sister!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mary had only to be grateful and give general assurances; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
now very fully purposed to be the guest of neither brother nor sister
many months longer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Northamptonshire</b></font>)</div>You will divide your year between London and Northamptonshire?"

<p/>"Yes."

<p/>"That’s right; and in London, of course, a house of your own: no longer
with the Admiral. My dearest Henry, the advantage to you of getting
away from the Admiral before your manners are hurt by the contagion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), before you have contracted any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) foolish opinions, or learned
to sit over your dinner as if it were the best blessing of life! _You_
are not sensible of the gain, for your regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) has blinded you;
but, in my estimation, your marrying early may be the saving of you. To
have seen you grow like the Admiral in word or deed, look or gesture,
would have broken my heart."

<p/>"Well, well, we do not think quite alike here. The Admiral has his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
faults, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) is a very good man, and has been more than a father to
me. Few fathers would have let me have my own way half so much. You
must not prejudice Fanny against him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I must have them love one
another.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mary refrained from saying what she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) felt, that there could not be two
persons in existence whose characters and manners were less accordant:
time would discover it to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not help _this_ reflection
on the Admiral. " (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>Henry, I think so highly of Fanny Price, that if I
could suppose the next Mrs. Crawford would have half the reason which
my poor ill-used aunt had to abhor the very name, I would prevent the
marriage, if possible; but I know you: I know that a wife you _loved_
would be the happiest of women, and that even when you ceased to love,
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would yet find in you the liberality and good-breeding of a
gentleman.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The impossibility of not doing everything in the world to make Fanny
Price happy, or of ceasing to love Fanny Price, was of course the
groundwork of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) eloquent answer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>Had you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) this morning, Mary," he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) continued, "attending with
such ineffable sweetness and patience to all the demands of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) aunt’s
stupidity, working with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and for her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) colour beautifully
heightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) leant over the work, then returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) seat to
finish a note which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was previously engaged in writing for that
stupid woman’s service, and all this with such unpretending gentleness,
so much as if it were a matter of course that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not to have a
moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own command, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) hair arranged as neatly as it always is,
and one little curl falling forward as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) wrote, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) now and
then shook back, and in the midst of all this, still speaking at
intervals to _me_, or listening, and as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) liked to listen, to what
I said. Had you seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) so, Mary, you would not have implied the
possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) power over my heart ever ceasing."

<p/>"My dearest Henry,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mary, stopping short, and smiling in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
face, " (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>how glad I am to see you so much in love! It quite delights me.
But what will Mrs. Rushworth and Julia say?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I care neither what they say nor what they feel. They will now see
what sort of woman it is that can attach me, that can attach a man of
sense. I wish the discovery may do them any good. And they will now see
their cousin treated as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) ought to be, and I wish they may be
heartily ashamed of their own abominable neglect and unkindness. They
will be angry,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) added, after a moment’s silence, and in a cooler
tone; "Mrs. Rushworth will be very angry. It will be a bitter pill to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>); that is, like other bitter pills, it will have two moments’ ill
flavour, and then be swallowed and forgotten; for I am not such a
coxcomb as to suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) feelings more lasting than other women’s,
though _I_ was the object of them. Yes, Mary, my Fanny will feel a
difference indeed: a daily, hourly difference, in the behaviour of
every being who approaches her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and it will be the completion of my
happiness to know that I am the doer of it, that I am the person to
give the consequence so justly her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) due. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is dependent, helpless,
friendless, neglected, forgotten."

<p/>"Nay, Henry, not by all; not forgotten by all; not friendless or
forgotten. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Edmund never forgets her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>"Edmund! True, I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is, generally speaking, kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and so
is Sir Thomas in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way; but it is the way of a rich, superior,
long-worded, arbitrary uncle. What can Sir Thomas and Edmund together
do, what _do_ they do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness, comfort, honour, and dignity
in the world, to what I _shall_ do?"
