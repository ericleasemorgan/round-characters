<p/>They had a very fine day for Box Hill; and all the other outward circumstances of arrangement, accommodation, and punctuality, were in favour of a pleasant party. Mr. Weston directed the whole, officiating safely between Hartfield and the Vicarage, and every body was in good time. Emma and Harriet went together; Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, with the Eltons; the gentlemen on horseback. Mrs. Weston remained with Mr. Woodhouse. Nothing was wanting but to be happy when they got there. Seven miles were travelled in expectation of enjoyment, and every body had a burst of admiration on first arriving; but in the general amount of the day there was deficiency. There was a languor, a want of spirits, a want of union, which could not be got over. They separated too much into parties. The Eltons walked together; Mr. Knightley took charge of Miss Bates and Jane; and Emma and Harriet belonged to Frank Churchill. And Mr. Weston tried, in vain, to make them harmonise better. It seemed at first an accidental division, but it never materially varied. Mr. and Mrs. Elton, indeed, shewed no unwillingness to mix, and be as agreeable as they could; but during the two whole hours that were spent on the hill, there seemed a principle of separation, between the other parties, too strong for any fine prospects, or any cold collation, or any cheerful Mr. Weston, to remove.

<p/>At first it was downright dulness to Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never seen Frank Churchill so silent and stupid. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) said nothing worth hearing looked without seeing admired without intelligence listened without knowing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said. While he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was so dull, it was no wonder that Harriet should be dull likewise; and they were both insufferable.

<p/>When they all sat down it was better; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) taste a great deal better, for Frank Churchill grew talkative and gay, making her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first object. Every distinguishing attention that could be paid, was paid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). To amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and be agreeable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) eyes, seemed all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) cared for and Emma, glad to be enlivened, not sorry to be flattered, was gay and easy too, and gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) all the friendly encouragement, the admission to be gallant, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had ever given in the first and most animating period of their acquaintance; but which now, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own estimation, meant nothing, though in the judgment of most people looking on it must have had such an appearance as no English word but flirtation could very well describe. <div class="bookquote">"Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse flirted together excessively."  (<font color='red'><b>lady</b></font>)</div>They were laying themselves open to that very phrase and to having it sent off in a letter to Maple Grove by one lady, to Ireland by another. Not that Emma was gay and thoughtless from any real felicity; it was rather because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt less happy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed because she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was disappointed; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) attentions, and thought them all, whether in friendship, admiration, or playfulness, extremely judicious, they were not winning back her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) still intended him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How much I am obliged to you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), "for telling me to come to-day! If it had not been for you, I should certainly have lost all the happiness of this party. I had quite determined to go away again."

<p/>"Yes, you were very cross; and I do not know what about, except that you were too late for the best strawberries. I was a kinder friend than you deserved. But you were humble. You begged hard to be commanded to come."

<p/>"Don't say I was cross. I was fatigued. The heat overcame me."

<p/>"It is hotter to-day."

<p/>"Not to my feelings. I am perfectly comfortable to-day."

<p/>"You are comfortable because you are under command."

<p/>"Your command? Yes."

<p/>"Perhaps I intended you to say so, but I meant self-command. You had, somehow or other, broken bounds yesterday, and run away from your own management; but to-day you are got back again and as I cannot be always with you, it is best to believe your temper under your own command rather than mine."

<p/>"It comes to the same thing. I can have no self-command without a motive. You order me, whether you speak or not. And you can be always with me. You are always with me."

<p/>"Dating from three o'clock yesterday. My perpetual influence could not begin earlier, or you would not have been so much out of humour before."

<p/>"Three o'clock yesterday! That is your date. I thought I had seen you first in February."

<p/>"Your gallantry is really unanswerable. But (lowering her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) voice) nobody speaks except ourselves, and it is rather too much to be talking nonsense for the entertainment of seven silent people."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I say nothing of which I am ashamed,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>your</b></font>), with lively impudence. "I saw you first in February. Let every body on the Hill hear me if they can. Let my accents swell to Mickleham on one side, and Dorking on the other. I saw you first in February." And then whispering "Our companions are excessively stupid. What shall we do to rouse them? Any nonsense will serve. They shall talk. Ladies and gentlemen, I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse (who, wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is, presides) to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) desires to know what you are all thinking of?"

<p/>Some laughed, and answered good-humouredly. Miss Bates said a great deal; Mrs. Elton swelled at the idea of Miss Woodhouse's presiding; Mr. Knightley's answer was the most distinct.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is Miss Woodhouse sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would like to hear what we are all thinking of?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! no, no" cried Emma, laughing as carelessly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could "Upon no account in the world. It is the very last thing I would stand the brunt of just now. Let me hear any thing rather than what you are all thinking of. I will not say quite all. There are one or two, perhaps, (glancing at Mr. Weston and Harriet,) whose thoughts I might not be afraid of knowing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a sort of thing,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Elton emphatically, "which I should not have thought myself privileged to inquire into. Though, perhaps, as the Chaperon of the party I never was in any circle exploring parties young ladies married women "

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mutterings were chiefly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband; and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) murmured, in reply,

<p/>"Very true, my love, very true. Exactly so, indeed quite unheard of but some ladies say any thing. Better pass it off as a joke. Every body knows what is due to you."

<p/>"It will not do," whispered Frank to Emma; "they are most of them affronted. I will attack them with more address. Ladies and gentlemen I am ordered by Miss Woodhouse to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) waives her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) right of knowing exactly what you may all be thinking of, and only requires something very entertaining from each of you, in a general way. Here are seven of you, besides myself, (who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is pleased to say, am very entertaining already,) and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) only demands from each of you either one thing very clever, be it prose or verse, original or repeated or two things moderately clever or three things very dull indeed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) engages to laugh heartily at them all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Miss Bates, "then I need not be uneasy. <div class="bookquote">'Three things very dull indeed.'  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>That will just do for me, you know. I shall be sure to say three dull things as soon as ever I open my mouth, shan't I? (looking round with the most good-humoured dependence on every body's assent) Do not you all think I shall?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma could not resist.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ah! ma'am, but there may be a difficulty. Pardon me but you will be limited as to number only three at once.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Bates, deceived by the mock ceremony of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) manner, did not immediately catch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) meaning; but, when it burst on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>), it could not anger, though a slight blush shewed that it could pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Ah! well to be sure. Yes, I see what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) means, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) and I will try to hold my tongue. I must make myself very disagreeable, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) would not have said such a thing to an old friend."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I like your plan,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Weston. "Agreed, agreed. I will do my best. I am making a conundrum. How will a conundrum reckon?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Low, I am afraid, sir, very low,"  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>answered his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son; "but we shall be indulgent especially to any one who leads the way."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, no,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "it will not reckon low. A conundrum of Mr. Weston's shall clear him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) next neighbour. Come, sir, pray let me hear it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I doubt its being very clever myself,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston. "It is too much a matter of fact, but here it is. What two letters of the alphabet are there, that express perfection?"

<p/>"What two letters! express perfection! I am sure I do not know."

<p/>"Ah! you will never guess. You, (to Emma), I am certain, will never guess. I will tell you. M. and A. Em-ma. Do you understand?"

<p/>Understanding and gratification came together. It might be a very indifferent piece of wit, but Emma found a great deal to laugh at and enjoy in it and so did Frank and Harriet. It did not seem to touch the rest of the party equally; some looked very stupid about it, and Mr. Knightley gravely said,

<p/>"This explains the sort of clever thing that is wanted, and Mr. Weston has done very well for himself; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must have knocked up every body else. Perfection should not have come quite so soon."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! for myself, I protest I must be excused,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Elton</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Elton; "I really cannot attempt I am not at all fond of the sort of thing. I had an acrostic once sent to me upon my own name, which I was not at all pleased with. I knew who it came from. An abominable puppy! You know who I mean (nodding to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) husband). These kind of things are very well at Christmas, when one is sitting round the fire; but quite out of place, in my opinion, when one is exploring about the country in summer. Miss Woodhouse must excuse me. I am not one of those who have witty things at every body's service. I do not pretend to be a wit. I have a great deal of vivacity in my own way, but I really must be allowed to judge when to speak and when to hold my tongue. Pass us, if you please, Mr. Churchill. Pass Mr. E., Knightley, Jane, and myself. We have nothing clever to say not one of us.

<p/>"Yes, yes, pray pass me," added her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) husband, with a sort of sneering consciousness; "I have nothing to say that can entertain Miss Woodhouse, or any other young lady. An old married man quite good for nothing. Shall we walk, Augusta?"

<p/>"With all my heart. I am really tired of exploring so long on one spot. Come, Jane, take my other arm.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane declined it, however, and the husband and wife walked off. " (<font color='red'><b>couple</b></font>)</div>Happy couple!" said Frank Churchill, as soon as they were out of hearing: "How well they suit one another! Very lucky marrying as they did, upon an acquaintance formed only in a public place! They only knew each other, I think, a few weeks in Bath! Peculiarly lucky! for as to any real knowledge of a person's disposition that Bath, or any public place, can give it is all nothing; there can be no knowledge. It is only by seeing women in their own homes, among their own set, just as they always are, that you can form any just judgment. Short of that, it is all guess and luck and will generally be ill-luck. How many a man has committed himself on a short acquaintance, and rued it all the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) life!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Fairfax, who had seldom spoken before, except among her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own confederates, spoke now.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such things do occur, undoubtedly." She (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was stopped by a cough. Frank Churchill turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to listen.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You were speaking,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), gravely. She (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) voice.

<p/>"I was only going to observe, that though such unfortunate circumstances do sometimes occur both to men and women, I cannot imagine them to be very frequent. A hasty and imprudent attachment may arise but there is generally time to recover from it afterwards. I would be understood to mean, that it can be only weak, irresolute characters, (whose happiness must be always at the mercy of chance,) who will suffer an unfortunate acquaintance to be an inconvenience, an oppression for ever.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) made no answer; merely looked, and bowed in submission; and soon afterwards said, in a lively tone,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well, I have so little confidence in my own judgment, that whenever I marry, I hope some body will chuse my wife for me. Will you? (turning to Emma.) Will you chuse a wife for me? I am sure I should like any body fixed on by you. You provide for the family, you know, (with a smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) father). Find some body for me. I am in no hurry. Adopt her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), educate her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)."

<p/>"And make her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) like myself."

<p/>"By all means, if you can."

<p/>"Very well. I undertake the commission. You shall have a charming wife."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) must be very lively, and have hazle eyes. I care for nothing else. I shall go abroad for a couple of years and when I return, I shall come to you for my wife. Remember."

<p/>Emma was in no danger of forgetting. It was a commission to touch every favourite feeling. Would not Harriet be the very creature described? Hazle eyes excepted, two years more might make her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wished. He (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might even have Harriet in his (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts at the moment; who could say? Referring the education to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) seemed to imply it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now, ma'am,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt, "shall we join Mrs. Elton?"

<p/>"If you please, my dear. With all my heart. I am quite ready. I was ready to have gone with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), but this will do just as well. We shall soon overtake her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). There she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is no, that's somebody else. That's one of the ladies in the Irish car party, not at all like her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Well, I declare "

<p/>They walked off, followed in half a minute by Mr. Knightley. Mr. Weston, his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son, Emma, and Harriet, only remained; and the young man's spirits now rose to a pitch almost unpleasant. Even Emma grew tired at last of flattery and merriment, and wished herself rather walking quietly about with any of the others, or sitting almost alone, and quite unattended to, in tranquil observation of the beautiful views beneath her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). The appearance of the servants looking out for them to give notice of the carriages was a joyful sight; and even the bustle of collecting and preparing to depart, and the solicitude of Mrs. Elton to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) carriage first, were gladly endured, in the prospect of the quiet drive home which was to close the very questionable enjoyments of this day of pleasure. Such another scheme, composed of so many ill-assorted people, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped never to be betrayed into again.

<p/>While waiting for the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) found Mr. Knightley by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) side. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked around, as if to see that no one were near, and then said,

<p/>"Emma, I must once more speak to you as I have been used to do: a privilege rather endured than allowed, perhaps, but I must still use it. I cannot see you acting wrong, without a remonstrance. How could you be so unfeeling to Miss Bates? How could you be so insolent in your wit to a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) character, age, and situation? Emma, I had not thought it possible.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma recollected, blushed, was sorry, but tried to laugh it off.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Nay, how could I help saying what I did? Nobody could have helped it. It was not so very bad. I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not understand me."

<p/>"I assure you she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt your full meaning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has talked of it since. I wish you could have heard how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) talked of it with what candour and generosity. I wish you could have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) honouring your forbearance, in being able to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) such attentions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was for ever receiving from yourself and your father, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society must be so irksome."

<p/>"Oh!" cried Emma, "I know there is not a better creature in the world: but you must allow, that what is good and what is ridiculous are most unfortunately blended in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They are blended,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), "I acknowledge; and, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prosperous, I could allow much for the occasional prevalence of the ridiculous over the good. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a woman of fortune, I would leave every harmless absurdity to take its chance, I would not quarrel with you for any liberties of manner. Were she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) your equal in situation but, Emma, consider how far this is from being the case. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is poor; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has sunk from the comforts she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was born to; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) live to old age, must probably sink more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation should secure your compassion. It was badly done, indeed! You, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had known from an infant, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had seen grow up from a period when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) notice was an honour, to have you now, in thoughtless spirits, and the pride of the moment, laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), humble her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) niece, too and before others, many of whom (certainly some,) would be entirely guided by your treatment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). This is not pleasant to you, Emma and it is very far from pleasant to me; but I must, I will, I will tell you truths while I can; satisfied with proving myself your friend by very faithful counsel, and trusting that you will some time or other do me greater justice than you can do now."

<p/>While they talked, they were advancing towards the carriage; it was ready; and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could speak again, he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had handed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had misinterpreted the feelings which had kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face averted, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue motionless. They were combined only of anger against herself, mortification, and deep concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not been able to speak; and, on entering the carriage, sunk back for a moment overcome then reproaching herself for having taken no leave, making no acknowledgment, parting in apparent sullenness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked out with voice and hand eager to shew a difference; but it was just too late. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had turned away, and the horses were in motion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued to look back, but in vain; and soon, with what appeared unusual speed, they were half way down the hill, and every thing left far behind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was vexed beyond what could have been expressed almost beyond what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could conceal. Never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt so agitated, mortified, grieved, at any circumstance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was most forcibly struck. The truth of this representation there was no denying. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart. How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) have been so brutal, so cruel to Miss Bates! How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) have exposed herself to such ill opinion in any one she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) valued! And how suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) without saying one word of gratitude, of concurrence, of common kindness!

<p/>Time did not compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>). As she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) reflected more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) seemed but to feel it more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) never had been so depressed. Happily it was not necessary to speak. There was only Harriet, who seemed not in spirits herself, fagged, and very willing to be silent; and Emma felt the tears running down her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cheeks almost all the way home, without being at any trouble to check them, extraordinary as they were.
