<p/>Elinor, starting back with a look of horror at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), obeyed
the first impulse of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart in turning instantly to quit the room,
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand was already on the lock, when its action was suspended by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hastily advancing, and saying, in a voice rather of command than
supplication,

<p/>"Miss Dashwood, for half an hour—for ten minutes—I entreat you to
stay."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) replied with firmness, "I shall _not_ stay. Your
business cannot be with _me_. The servants, I suppose, forgot to tell
you that Mr. Palmer was not in the house."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Had they told me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) cried with vehemence, "that Mr. Palmer and all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) relations were at the devil, it would not have turned me from the
door. My business is with you, and only you."

<p/>"With me!"—in the utmost amazement—"well, sir,—be quick—and if you
can—less violent."

<p/>"Sit down, and I will be both."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) hesitated; she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) knew not what to do. The possibility of Colonel
Brandon’s arriving and finding her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) there, came across her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>). But she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had
promised to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) curiosity no less than her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) honor was
engaged. After a moment’s recollection, therefore, concluding that
prudence required dispatch, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) acquiescence would best
promote it, she (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) walked silently towards the table, and sat down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
took the opposite chair, and for half a minute not a word was said by
either.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pray be quick, sir," (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>—said Elinor, impatiently;—<div class="bookquote">"I have no time to
spare."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was sitting in an attitude of deep meditation, and seemed not to
hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), with abruptness, a moment afterwards—"is out of
danger. I heard it from the servant. God be praised!—But is it true? is
it really true?"

<p/>Elinor would not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) repeated the inquiry with yet greater
eagerness.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For God’s sake tell me, is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) out of danger, or is she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) not?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"We hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) rose up, and walked across the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Had I known as much half an hour ago;—but since I _am_ here,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>speaking
with a forced vivacity as he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) returned to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) seat,—"what does it
signify? For once, Miss Dashwood—it will be the last time, perhaps—let
us be cheerful together. I am in a fine mood for gaiety. Tell me
honestly" a deeper glow overspreading his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) cheeks, "do you think me most
a knave or a fool?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) with greater astonishment than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) began to
think that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) must be in liquor;—the strangeness of such a visit, and
of such manners, seemed no otherwise intelligible; and with this
impression she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately rose, saying,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Willoughby/Willoughby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Willoughby, I advise you at present to return to Combe. I am not
at leisure to remain with you longer. Whatever your business may be
with me, it will be better recollected and explained to-morrow."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I understand you,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) replied, with an expressive smile, and a voice
perfectly calm; "yes, I am very drunk. A pint of porter with my cold
beef at Marlborough was enough to over-set me."

<p/>"At Marlborough!<div class="bookquote">"—cried Elinor, more and more at a loss to understand
what he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) would be at.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes,—I left London this morning at eight o’clock, and the only ten
minutes I have spent out of my chaise since that time procured me a
nuncheon at Marlborough.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The steadiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) manner, and the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) eye as he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>)
spoke, convincing Elinor, that whatever other unpardonable folly might
bring him (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) to Cleveland, he (<font color='blue'><b>porter</b></font>) was not brought there by intoxication, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
said, after a moment’s recollection,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Willoughby/Willoughby</b></font>)</div>Mr. Willoughby, you _ought_ to feel, and I certainly _do_, that after
what has passed, your coming here in this manner, and forcing yourself
upon my notice, requires a very particular excuse. What is it, that you
mean by it?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I mean,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), with serious energy, "if I can, to make you hate me
one degree less than you do _now_. I mean to offer some kind of
explanation, some kind of apology, for the past; to open my whole heart
to you, and by convincing you, that though I have been always a
blockhead, I have not been always a rascal, to obtain something like
forgiveness from Ma— from your sister."

<p/>"Is this the real reason of your coming?"

<p/>"Upon my soul it is,<div class="bookquote">"—was his (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) answer, with a warmth which brought all
the former Willoughby to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) remembrance, and in spite of herself made
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) think him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) sincere.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>If that is all, you may be satisfied already; for Marianne _does_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
has _long_ forgiven you."

<p/>"Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?<div class="bookquote">" he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) cried, in the same eager tone. " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) has forgiven me
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) ought to have done it. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) shall forgive me again, and
on more reasonable grounds. _Now_ will you listen to me?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor bowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) assent.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not know," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), after a pause of expectation on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) side, and
thoughtfulness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own, "how _you_ may have accounted for my
behaviour to your sister, or what diabolical motive you may have
imputed to me. Perhaps you will hardly think the better of me,—it is
worth the trial however, and you shall hear every thing. When I first
became intimate in your family, I had no other intention, no other view
in the acquaintance than to pass my time pleasantly while I was obliged
to remain in Devonshire, more pleasantly than I had ever done before.
Your sister’s lovely person and interesting manners could not but
please me; and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) behaviour to me almost from the first, was of a
kind—it is astonishing, when I reflect on what it was, and what _she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)_
was, that my heart should have been so insensible! But at first I must
confess, my vanity only was elevated by it. Careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) happiness,
thinking only of my own amusement, giving way to feelings which I had
always been too much in the habit of indulging, I endeavoured, by every
means in my power, to make myself pleasing to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), without any design
of returning her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) affection."

<p/>Miss Dashwood, at this point, turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) eyes on him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) with the most
angry contempt, stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), by saying,

<p/>"It is hardly worth while, Mr. Willoughby, for you to relate, or for me
to listen any longer. Such a beginning as this cannot be followed by
any thing. Do not let me be pained by hearing any thing more on the
subject."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I insist on you hearing the whole of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, "My fortune was
never large, and I had always been expensive, always in the habit of
associating with people of better income than myself. Every year since
my coming of age, or even before, I believe, had added to my debts; and
though the death of my old cousin, Mrs. Smith, was to set me free; yet
that event being uncertain, and possibly far distant, it had been for
some time my intention to re-establish my circumstances by marrying a
woman of fortune. To attach myself to your sister, therefore, was not a
thing to be thought of; and with a meanness, selfishness, cruelty,
which no indignant, no contemptuous look, even of yours, Miss Dashwood,
can ever reprobate too much,—I was acting in this manner, trying to
engage her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) regard, without a thought of returning it. But one thing may
be said for me: even in that horrid state of selfish vanity, I did not
know the extent of the injury I meditated, because I did not _then_
know what it was to love. But have I ever known it? Well may it be
doubted; for, had I really loved, could I have sacrificed my feelings
to vanity, to avarice? or, what is more, could I have sacrificed hers?
But I have done it. To avoid a comparative poverty, which her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) affection
and her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) society would have deprived of all its horrors, I have, by
raising myself to affluence, lost every thing that could make it a
blessing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You did then,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, a little softened, "believe yourself at
one time attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To have resisted such attractions, to have withstood such tenderness!
Is there a man on earth who could have done it? Yes, I found myself, by
insensible degrees, sincerely fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and the happiest hours of my
life were what I spent with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) when I felt my intentions were strictly
honourable, and my feelings blameless. Even _then_, however, when fully
determined on paying my addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), I allowed myself most
improperly to put off, from day to day, the moment of doing it, from an
unwillingness to enter into an engagement while my circumstances were
so greatly embarrassed. I will not reason here—nor will I stop for
_you_ to expatiate on the absurdity, and the worse than absurdity, of
scrupling to engage my faith where my honour was already bound. The
event has proved, that I was a cunning fool, providing with great
circumspection for a possible opportunity of making myself contemptible
and wretched for ever. At last, however, my resolution was taken, and I
had determined, as soon as I could engage her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) alone, to justify the
attentions I had so invariably paid her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>), and openly assure her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) of an
affection which I had already taken such pains to display. But in the
interim—in the interim of the very few hours that were to pass, before
I could have an opportunity of speaking with her (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) in private—a
circumstance occurred—an unlucky circumstance, to ruin all my
resolution, and with it all my comfort. A discovery took place," (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>—here
he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) hesitated and looked down. "Mrs. Smith had somehow or other been
informed, I imagine by some distant relation, whose interest it was to
deprive me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) favour, of an affair, a connection—but I need not
explain myself farther," he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) with an heightened
colour and an enquiring eye,—"your particular intimacy—you have
probably heard the whole story long ago."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor, colouring likewise, and hardening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) heart
anew against any compassion for him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>), "I have heard it all. And how you
will explain away any part of your guilt in that dreadful business, I
confess is beyond my comprehension."

<p/>"Remember,<div class="bookquote">" cried Willoughby, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>from whom you received the account.
Could it be an impartial one? I acknowledge that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) situation and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
character ought to have been respected by me. I do not mean to justify
myself, but at the same time cannot leave you to suppose that I have
nothing to urge—that because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was injured she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was irreproachable,
and because _I_ was a libertine, _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ must be a saint. If the violence
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) passions, the weakness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) understanding—I do not mean,
however, to defend myself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) affection for me deserved better
treatment, and I often, with great self-reproach, recall the tenderness
which, for a very short time, had the power of creating any return. I
wish—I heartily wish it had never been. But I have injured more than
herself; and I have injured one, whose affection for me (may I say it?)
was scarcely less warm than hers; and whose mind—Oh! how infinitely
superior!"

<p/>"Your indifference, however, towards that unfortunate girl—I must say
it, unpleasant to me as the discussion of such a subject may well
be—your indifference is no apology for your cruel neglect of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Do
not think yourself excused by any weakness, any natural defect of
understanding on her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) side, in the wanton cruelty so evident on yours.
You must have known, that while you were enjoying yourself in
Devonshire pursuing fresh schemes, always gay, always happy, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was
reduced to the extremest indigence."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But, upon my soul, I did _not_ know it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) warmly replied; "I did not
recollect that I had omitted to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) my direction; and common sense
might have told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) how to find it out."

<p/>"Well, sir, and what said Mrs. Smith?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) taxed me with the offence at once, and my confusion may be
guessed. The purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) life, the formality of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) notions, her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
ignorance of the world—every thing was against me. The matter itself I
could not deny, and vain was every endeavour to soften it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was
previously disposed, I believe, to doubt the morality of my conduct in
general, and was moreover discontented with the very little attention,
the very little portion of my time that I had bestowed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), in my
present visit. In short, it ended in a total breach. By one measure I
might have saved myself. In the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) morality, good woman! she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
offered to forgive the past, if I would marry Eliza. That could not
be—and I was formally dismissed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) favour and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) house. The
night following this affair—I was to go the next morning—was spent by
me in deliberating on what my future conduct should be. The struggle
was great—but it ended too soon. My affection for Marianne, my thorough
conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attachment to me—it was all insufficient to outweigh
that dread of poverty, or get the better of those false ideas of the
necessity of riches, which I was naturally inclined to feel, and
expensive society had increased. I had reason to believe myself secure
of my present wife, if I chose to address her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and I persuaded myself
to think that nothing else in common prudence remained for me to do. A
heavy scene however awaited me, before I could leave Devonshire;—I was
engaged to dine with you on that very day; some apology was therefore
necessary for my breaking this engagement. But whether I should write
this apology, or deliver it in person, was a point of long debate. To
see Marianne, I felt, would be dreadful, and I even doubted whether I
could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) again, and keep to my resolution. In that point, however,
I undervalued my own magnanimity, as the event declared; for I went, I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) miserable, and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) miserable—and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
hoping never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) again."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why did you call, Mr. Willoughby?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, reproachfully; "a note
would have answered every purpose. Why was it necessary to call?"

<p/>"It was necessary to my own pride. I could not bear to leave the
country in a manner that might lead you, or the rest of the
neighbourhood, to suspect any part of what had really passed between
Mrs. Smith and myself—and I resolved therefore on calling at the
cottage, in my way to Honiton. The sight of your dear sister, however,
was really dreadful; and, to heighten the matter, I found her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) alone.
You were all gone I do not know where. I had left her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) only the evening
before, so fully, so firmly resolved within my self on doing right! A
few hours were to have engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to me for ever; and I remember how
happy, how gay were my spirits, as I walked from the cottage to
Allenham, satisfied with myself, delighted with every body! But in
this, our last interview of friendship, I approached her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) with a sense
of guilt that almost took from me the power of dissembling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sorrow,
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) disappointment, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) deep regret, when I told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that I was obliged
to leave Devonshire so immediately—I never shall forget it—united too
with such reliance, such confidence in me!—Oh, God!—what a hard-hearted
rascal I was!"

<p/>They were both silent for a few moments. Elinor first spoke.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did you tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that you should soon return?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know what I told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>rascal</b></font>) replied, impatiently; "less than
was due to the past, beyond a doubt, and in all likelihood much more
than was justified by the future. I cannot think of it.—It won’t
do.—Then came your dear mother to torture me farther, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
kindness and confidence. Thank Heaven! it _did_ torture me. I was
miserable. Miss Dashwood, you cannot have an idea of the comfort it
gives me to look back on my own misery. I owe such a grudge to myself
for the stupid, rascally folly of my own heart, that all my past
sufferings under it are only triumph and exultation to me now. Well, I
went, left all that I loved, and went to those to whom, at best, I was
only indifferent. My journey to town—travelling with my own horses, and
therefore so tediously—no creature to speak to—my own reflections so
cheerful—when I looked forward every thing so inviting!—when I looked
back at Barton, the picture so soothing!—oh, it was a blessed journey!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>Well, sir," said Elinor, who, though pitying him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>), grew impatient for
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) departure, "and this is all?"

<p/>"All!—no:—have you forgot what passed in town? That infamous letter?
Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) show it you?"

<p/>"Yes, I saw every note that passed."

<p/>"When the first of hers reached me (as it immediately did, for I was in
town the whole time,) what I felt is—in the common phrase, not to be
expressed; in a more simple one—perhaps too simple to raise any
emotion—my feelings were very, very painful.—Every line, every word
was—in the hackneyed metaphor which their dear writer, were she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) here,
would forbid—a dagger to my heart. To know that Marianne was in town
was—in the same language—a thunderbolt.—Thunderbolts and daggers!—what
a reproof would she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) have given me!—her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) taste, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opinions—I believe
they are better known to me than my own,—and I am sure they are
dearer.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor’s heart, which had undergone many changes in the course of this
extraordinary conversation, was now softened again;—yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt it her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
duty to check such ideas in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) companion as the last.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Willoughby/Willoughby</b></font>)</div>This is not right, Mr. Willoughby.—Remember that you are married.
Relate only what in your conscience you think necessary for me to
hear."

<p/>"Marianne’s note, by assuring me that I was still as dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) as in
former days,—that in spite of the many, many weeks we had been
separated, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was as constant in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own feelings, and as full of
faith in the constancy of mine as ever,—awakened all my remorse. I say
awakened, because time and London, business and dissipation, had in
some measure quieted it, and I had been growing a fine hardened
villain, fancying myself indifferent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and chusing to fancy that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) too must have become indifferent to me; talking to myself of our
past attachment as a mere idle, trifling business, shrugging up my
shoulders in proof of its being so, and silencing every reproach,
overcoming every scruple, by secretly saying now and then, <div class="bookquote">‘I shall be
heartily glad to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) is well married.’  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>But this note made me know
myself better. I felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was infinitely dearer to me than any
other woman in the world, and that I was using her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) infamously. But
every thing was then just settled between Miss Grey and me. To retreat
was impossible. All that I had to do, was to avoid you both. I sent no
answer to Marianne, intending by that to preserve myself from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
farther notice; and for some time I was even determined not to call in
Berkeley Street;—but at last, judging it wiser to affect the air of a
cool, common acquaintance than anything else, I watched you all safely
out of the house one morning, and left my name."

<p/>"Watched us out of the house!"

<p/>"Even so. You would be surprised to hear how often I watched you, how
often I was on the point of falling in with you. I have entered many a
shop to avoid your sight, as the carriage drove by. Lodging as I did in
Bond Street, there was hardly a day in which I did not catch a glimpse
of one or other of you; and nothing but the most constant watchfulness
on my side, a most invariably prevailing desire to keep out of your
sight, could have separated us so long. I avoided the Middletons as
much as possible, as well as everybody else who was likely to prove an
acquaintance in common. Not aware of their being in town, however, I
blundered on Sir John, I believe, the first day of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) coming, and the
day after I had called at Mrs. Jennings’s. He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) asked me to a party, a
dance at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) house in the evening. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) _not_ told me as an
inducement that you and your sister were to be there, I should have
felt it too certain a thing, to trust myself near him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>). The next morning
brought another short note from Marianne—still affectionate, open,
artless, confiding—everything that could make _my_ conduct most
hateful. I could not answer it. I tried—but could not frame a sentence.
But I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), I believe, every moment of the day. If you _can_
pity me, Miss Dashwood, pity my situation as it was _then_. With my
head and heart full of your sister, I was forced to play the happy
lover to another woman! Those three or four weeks were worse than all.
Well, at last, as I need not tell you, you were forced on me; and what
a sweet figure I cut! what an evening of agony it was! Marianne,
beautiful as an angel on one side, calling me Willoughby in such a
tone! Oh, God! holding out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand to me, asking me for an
explanation, with those bewitching eyes fixed in such speaking
solicitude on my face! and Sophia, jealous as the devil on the other
hand, looking all that was—Well, it does not signify; it is over now.
Such an evening! I ran away from you all as soon as I could; but not
before I had seen Marianne’s sweet face as white as death. _That_ was
the last, last look I ever had of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>); the last manner in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
appeared to me. It was a horrid sight! yet when I thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to-day
as really dying, it was a kind of comfort to me to imagine that I knew
exactly how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would appear to those, who saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) last in this world.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was before me, constantly before me, as I travelled, in the same
look and hue."

<p/>A short pause of mutual thoughtfulness succeeded. Willoughby first
rousing himself, broke it thus:

<p/>"Well, let me make haste and be gone. Your sister is certainly better,
certainly out of danger?"

<p/>"We are assured of it."

<p/>"Your poor mother, too!—doting on Marianne."

<p/>"But the letter, Mr. Willoughby, your own letter; have you any thing to
say about that?"

<p/>"Yes, yes, _that_ in particular. Your sister wrote to me again, you
know, the very next morning. You saw what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said. I was breakfasting
at the Ellisons,—and her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) letter, with some others, was brought to me
there from my lodgings. It happened to catch Sophia’s eye before it
caught mine—and its size, the elegance of the paper, the hand-writing
altogether, immediately gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) a suspicion. Some vague report had
reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) before of my attachment to some young lady in Devonshire,
and what had passed within her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) observation the preceding evening had
marked who the young lady was, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more jealous than ever.
Affecting that air of playfulness, therefore, which is delightful in a
woman one loves, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) opened the letter directly, and read its contents.
She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was well paid for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) impudence. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) read what made her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wretched.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) wretchedness I could have borne, but her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) passion—her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) malice—At all
events it must be appeased. And, in short—what do you think of my
wife’s style of letter-writing?—delicate—tender—truly feminine—was it
not?"

<p/>"Your wife!—The letter was in your own hand-writing."

<p/>"Yes, but I had only the credit of servilely copying such sentences as
I was ashamed to put my name to. The original was all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own—her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own
happy thoughts and gentle diction. But what could I do!—we were
engaged, every thing in preparation, the day almost fixed—But I am
talking like a fool. Preparation! Day! In honest words, her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) money was
necessary to me, and in a situation like mine, any thing was to be done
to prevent a rupture. And after all, what did it signify to my
character in the opinion of Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) friends, in what language
my answer was couched? It must have been only to one end. My business
was to declare myself a scoundrel, and whether I did it with a bow or a
bluster was of little importance. <div class="bookquote">‘I am ruined for ever in their
opinion,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>said I to myself: <div class="bookquote">‘I am shut out for ever from their society,
they already think me an unprincipled fellow, this letter will only
make them think me a blackguard one.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Such were my reasonings, as, in a
sort of desperate carelessness, I copied my wife’s words, and parted
with the last relics of Marianne. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) three notes,—unluckily they were
all in my pocketbook, or I should have denied their existence, and
hoarded them for ever,—I was forced to put them up, and could not even
kiss them. And the lock of hair—that too I had always carried about me
in the same pocket-book, which was now searched by Madam with the most
ingratiating virulence,—the dear lock,—all, every memento was torn from
me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are very wrong, Mr. Willoughby, very blamable,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, while
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice, in spite of herself, betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) compassionate emotion;
"you ought not to speak in this way, either of Mrs. Willoughby or my
sister. You had made your own choice. It was not forced on you. Your
wife has a claim to your politeness, to your respect, at least. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
must be attached to you, or she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not have married you. To treat
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) with unkindness, to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) slightingly is no atonement to
Marianne—nor can I suppose it a relief to your own conscience."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not talk to me of my wife,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) with a heavy sigh; "she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) does
not deserve your compassion. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew I had no regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) when we
married. Well, married we were, and came down to Combe Magna to be
happy, and afterwards returned to town to be gay. And now do you pity
me, Miss Dashwood? Or have I said all this to no purpose? Am I,—be it
only one degree,—am I less guilty in your opinion than I was before? My
intentions were not always wrong. Have I explained away any part of my
guilt?"

<p/>"Yes, you have certainly removed something—a little. You have proved
yourself, on the whole, less faulty than I had believed you. You have
proved your heart less wicked, much less wicked. But I hardly know—the
misery that you have inflicted—I hardly know what could have made it
worse."

<p/>"Will you repeat to your sister when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is recovered, what I have been
telling you?—Let me be a little lightened too in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) opinion as well as
in yours. You tell me that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) has forgiven me already. Let me be able
to fancy that a better knowledge of my heart, and of my present
feelings, will draw from her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a more spontaneous, more natural, more
gentle, less dignified, forgiveness. Tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) of my misery and my
penitence—tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) that my heart was never inconstant to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), and if
you will, that at this moment she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is dearer to me than ever."

<p/>"I will tell her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) all that is necessary to what may comparatively be
called, your justification. But you have not explained to me the
particular reason of your coming now, nor how you heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
illness."

<p/>"Last night, in Drury Lane lobby, I ran against Sir John Middleton, and
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) saw who I was, for the first time these two months, he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) spoke to
me. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had cut me ever since my marriage, I had seen without
surprise or resentment. Now, however, his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) good-natured, honest, stupid
soul, full of indignation against me, and concern for your sister,
could not resist the temptation of telling me what he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) knew ought to,
though probably he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) did not think it _would_, vex me horridly. As
bluntly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) could speak it, therefore, he (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) told me that Marianne
Dashwood was dying of a putrid fever at Cleveland—a letter that morning
received from Mrs. Jennings declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) danger most imminent—the
Palmers are all gone off in a fright, &c. I was too much shocked to be
able to pass myself off as insensible even to the undiscerning Sir
John. His (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) heart was softened in seeing mine suffer; and so much of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
ill-will was done away, that when we parted, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) almost shook me by the
hand while he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) reminded me of an old promise about a pointer puppy. What
I felt on hearing that your sister was dying, and dying too, believing
me the greatest villain upon earth, scorning, hating me in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) latest
moments—for how could I tell what horrid projects might not have been
imputed? _One_ person I was sure would represent me as capable of
anything—What I felt was dreadful! My resolution was soon made, and at
eight o’clock this morning I was in my carriage. Now you know all."

<p/>Elinor made no answer. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thoughts were silently fixed on the
irreparable injury which too early an independence and its consequent
habits of idleness, dissipation, and luxury, had made in the mind, the
character, the happiness, of a man who, to every advantage of person
and talents, united a disposition naturally open and honest, and a
feeling, affectionate temper. The world had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) extravagant and
vain—Extravagance and vanity had made him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cold-hearted and selfish.
Vanity, while seeking its own guilty triumph at the expense of another,
had involved him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in a real attachment, which extravagance, or at least
its offspring, necessity, had required to be sacrificed. Each faulty
propensity in leading him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to evil, had led him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) likewise to punishment.
The attachment, from which against honour, against feeling, against
every better interest he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had outwardly torn himself, now, when no
longer allowable, governed every thought; and the connection, for the
sake of which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had, with little scruple, left her (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister to misery,
was likely to prove a source of unhappiness to himself of a far more
incurable nature. From a reverie of this kind she (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was recalled at the
end of some minutes by Willoughby, who, rousing himself from a reverie
at least equally painful, started up in preparation for going, and
said—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no use in staying here; I must be off."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Willoughby/Willoughby</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Are you going back to town?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"No—to Combe Magna. I have business there; from thence to town in a day
or two. Good bye."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) held out his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not refuse to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) hers;—he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pressed
it with affection.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And you _do_ think something better of me than you did?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>),
letting it fall, and leaning against the mantel-piece as if forgetting
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was to go.

<p/>Elinor assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did;—that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) forgave, pitied, wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
well—was even interested in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) happiness—and added some gentle counsel
as to the behaviour most likely to promote it. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) answer was not very
encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As to that,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), "I must rub through the world as well as I can.
Domestic happiness is out of the question. If, however, I am allowed to
think that you and yours feel an interest in my fate and actions, it
may be the means—it may put me on my guard—at least, it may be
something to live for. Marianne to be sure is lost to me for ever. Were
I even by any blessed chance at liberty again—<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor stopped him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) with a reproof.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Well,"—he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) replied—"once more good bye. I shall now go away and live in
dread of one event."

<p/>"What do you mean?"

<p/>"Your sister’s marriage."

<p/>"You are very wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) can never be more lost to you than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) is
now."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) will be gained by some one else. And if that some one should
be the very he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) whom, of all others, I could least bear—but I will not
stay to rob myself of all your compassionate goodwill, by showing that
where I have most injured I can least forgive. Good bye,—God bless
you!"

<p/>And with these words, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) almost ran out of the room.
