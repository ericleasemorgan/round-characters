<p/>If Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the letter, did not expect
it to contain a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) offers, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had formed no
expectation at all of its contents. But such as they were, it may
well be supposed how eagerly she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went through them, and what a
contrariety of emotion they excited. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read
were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) first
understand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) believed any apology to be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) power; and
steadfastly was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) persuaded, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could have no explanation
to give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a
strong prejudice against everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might say, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
account of what had happened at Netherfield. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read with an
eagerness which hardly left her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power of comprehension, and from
impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring, was
incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s insensibility she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) instantly resolved
to be false; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account of the real, the worst objections to
the match, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) too angry to have any wish of doing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
justice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expressed no regret for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had done which
satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) style was not penitent, but haughty. It was
all pride and insolence.

<p/>But when this subject was succeeded by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) account of Mr.
Wickham—when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read with somewhat clearer attention a relation
of events which, if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) worth, and which bore so alarming an affinity to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own
history of himself—her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings were yet more acutely painful and
more difficult of definition. Astonishment, apprehension, and
even horror, oppressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished to discredit it entirely,
repeatedly exclaiming, "This must be false! This cannot be! This
must be the grossest falsehood!"—and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had gone through
the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the last
page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would not
regard it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would never look in it again.

<p/>In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on
nothing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walked on; but it would not do; in half a minute the
letter was unfolded again, and collecting herself as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) again began the mortifying perusal of all that related
to Wickham, and commanded herself so far as to examine the
meaning of every sentence. The account of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) connection with the
Pemberley family was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had related himself; and the
kindness of the late Mr. Darcy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not before known
its extent, agreed equally well with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own words. So far each
recital confirmed the other; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) came to the will, the
difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living was
fresh in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) memory, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) recalled his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) very words, it was
impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side
or the other; and, for a few moments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) flattered herself that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes did not err. But when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read and re-read with the
closest attention, the particulars immediately following of
Wickham’s resigning all pretensions to the living, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds,
again was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) forced to hesitate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) put down the letter,
weighed every circumstance with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) meant to be
impartiality—deliberated on the probability of each statement—but
with little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read on; but every line proved more clearly that the affair,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had believed it impossible that any contrivance could
so represent as to render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than
infamous, was capable of a turn which must make him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entirely
blameless throughout the whole.

<p/>The extravagance and general profligacy which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) scrupled not to
lay at Mr. Wickham’s charge, exceedingly shocked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); the more
so, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could bring no proof of its injustice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never
heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) before his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) entrance into the ——shire Militia, in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who, on
meeting him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) accidentally in town, had there renewed a slight
acquaintance. Of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) former way of life nothing had been known in
Hertfordshire but what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) told himself. As to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) real character,
had information been in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never felt a wish of
enquiring. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) countenance, voice, and manner had established him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
at once in the possession of every virtue. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) tried to recollect
some instance of goodness, some distinguished trait of integrity
or benevolence, that might rescue him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) from the attacks of Mr.
Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone for
those casual errors under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would endeavour to class what
Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’
continuance. But no such recollection befriended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could
see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) instantly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), in every charm of air and address;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could remember no more substantial good than the general
approbation of the neighbourhood, and the regard which his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) social
powers had gained him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in the mess. After pausing on this point a
considerable while, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) once more continued to read. But, alas!
the story which followed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) designs on Miss Darcy, received
some confirmation from what had passed between Colonel
Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at last she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel
Fitzwilliam himself—from whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had previously received the
information of his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) near concern in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) cousin’s affairs, and
whose character she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had no reason to question. At one time she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
had almost resolved on applying to him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>), but the idea was checked
by the awkwardness of the application, and at length wholly
banished by the conviction that Mr. Darcy would never have
hazarded such a proposal, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had not been well assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
cousin’s corroboration.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) perfectly remembered everything that had passed in
conversation between Wickham and herself, in their first evening
at Mr. Phillips’s. Many of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) expressions were still fresh in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) memory. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was _now_ struck with the impropriety of such
communications to a stranger, and wondered it had escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
had done, and the inconsistency of his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) professions with his (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>)
conduct. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) had boasted of having no fear of
seeing Mr. Darcy—that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that
_he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ should stand his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) ground; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had avoided the Netherfield
ball the very next week. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) remembered also that, till the
Netherfield family had quitted the country, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had told his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) story
to no one but herself; but that after their removal it had been
everywhere discussed; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had then no reserves, no scruples
in sinking Mr. Darcy’s character, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that
respect for the father would always prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) exposing the son.

<p/>How differently did everything now appear in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
concerned! His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attentions to Miss King were now the consequence
of views solely and hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fortune proved no longer the moderation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wishes, but
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eagerness to grasp at anything. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to herself
could now have had no tolerable motive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had either been
deceived with regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) fortune, or had been gratifying his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
vanity by encouraging the preference which she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) had
most incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour
grew fainter and fainter; and in farther justification of Mr.
Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) could not but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned
by Jane, had long ago asserted his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) blamelessness in the affair;
that proud and repulsive as were his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never, in
the whole course of their acquaintance—an acquaintance which had
latterly brought them much together, and given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a sort of
intimacy with his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) ways—seen anything that betrayed him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to be
unprincipled or unjust—anything that spoke him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) of irreligious or
immoral habits; that among his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own connections he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was esteemed
and valued—that even Wickham had allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) merit as a brother,
and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had often heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) speak so affectionately of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
sister as to prove him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) capable of some amiable feeling; that had
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) actions been what Mr. Wickham represented them, so gross a
violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed
from the world; and that friendship between a person capable of
it, and such an amiable man as Mr. Bingley, was incomprehensible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor
Wickham could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) think without feeling she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been blind,
partial, prejudiced, absurd.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How despicably I have acted!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried; "I, who have prided
myself on my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my
abilities! who have often disdained the generous candour of my
sister, and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust!
How humiliating is this discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation!
Had I been in love, I could not have been more wretchedly blind!
But vanity, not love, has been my folly. Pleased with the
preference of one, and offended by the neglect of the other, on
the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted
prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away, where either
were concerned. Till this moment I never knew myself."

<p/>From herself to Jane—from Jane to Bingley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thoughts were in a
line which soon brought to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) recollection that Mr. Darcy’s
explanation _there_ had appeared very insufficient, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) read
it again. Widely different was the effect of a second perusal.
How could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) deny that credit to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assertions in one instance,
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been obliged to give in the other? He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) declared
himself to be totally unsuspicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister’s attachment;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not help remembering what Charlotte’s opinion had
always been. Neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) deny the justice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
description of Jane. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt that Jane’s feelings, though
fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant
complacency in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) air and manner not often united with great
sensibility.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) came to that part of the letter in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family were
mentioned in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball,
and as confirming all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) first disapprobation, could not have
made a stronger impression on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind than on hers.

<p/>The compliment to herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister was not unfelt. It
soothed, but it could not console her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for the contempt which had
thus been self-attracted by the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) family; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
considered that Jane’s disappointment had in fact been the work
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) nearest relations, and reflected how materially the credit
of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt
depressed beyond anything she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had ever known before.

<p/>After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every
variety of thought—re-considering events, determining
probabilities, and reconciling herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could, to
a change so sudden and so important, fatigue, and a recollection
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) long absence, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at length return home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual,
and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unfit for conversation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was immediately told that the two gentlemen from Rosings had
each called during her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few
minutes, to take leave—but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been
sitting with them at least an hour, hoping for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) return, and
almost resolving to walk after her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could be found.
Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in missing him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no longer an
object; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could think only of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) letter.
