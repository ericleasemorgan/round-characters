<p/>On reaching home Fanny went immediately upstairs to deposit this
unexpected acquisition, this doubtful good of a necklace, in some
favourite box in the East room, which held all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) smaller treasures;
but on opening the door, what was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) surprise to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin
Edmund there writing at the table! Such a sight having never occurred
before, was almost as wonderful as it was welcome.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) directly, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) seat and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) pen, and meeting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) hand, "I beg your pardon for being here. I
came to look for you, and after waiting a little while in hope of your
coming in, was making use of your inkstand to explain my errand. You
will find the beginning of a note to yourself; but I can now speak my
business, which is merely to beg your acceptance of this little
trifle—a chain for William’s cross. You ought to have had it a week
ago, but there has been a delay from my brother’s not being in town by
several days so soon as I expected; and I have only just now received
it at Northampton. I hope you will like the chain itself, Fanny. I
endeavoured to consult the simplicity of your taste; but, at any rate,
I know you will be kind to my intentions, and consider it, as it really
is, a token of the love of one of your oldest friends."

<p/>And so saying, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was hurrying away, before Fanny, overpowered by a
thousand feelings of pain and pleasure, could attempt to speak; but
quickened by one sovereign wish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then called out, "Oh! cousin, stop
a moment, pray stop!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) turned back.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot attempt to thank you," she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) continued, in a very agitated
manner; <div class="bookquote">"thanks are out of the question. I feel much more than I can
possibly express. Your goodness in thinking of me in such a way is
beyond—"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"If that is all you have to say, Fanny<div class="bookquote">" smiling and turning away again.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>No, no, it is not. I want to consult you.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Almost unconsciously she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had now undone the parcel he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) had just put into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and seeing before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in all the niceness of jewellers’
packing, a plain gold chain, perfectly simple and neat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
help bursting forth again, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, this is beautiful indeed! This is the
very thing, precisely what I wished for! This is the only ornament I
have ever had a desire to possess. It will exactly suit my cross. They
must and shall be worn together. It comes, too, in such an acceptable
moment. Oh, cousin, you do not know how acceptable it is."

<p/>"My dear Fanny, you feel these things a great deal too much. I am most
happy that you like the chain, and that it should be here in time for
to-morrow; but your thanks are far beyond the occasion. Believe me, I
have no pleasure in the world superior to that of contributing to
yours. No, I can safely say, I have no pleasure so complete, so
unalloyed. It is without a drawback."

<p/>Upon such expressions of affection Fanny could have lived an hour
without saying another word; but Edmund, after waiting a moment,
obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to bring down her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind from its heavenly flight by saying,
"But what is it that you want to consult me about?"

<p/>It was about the necklace, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now most earnestly longing to
return, and hoped to obtain his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) approbation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gave the
history of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) recent visit, and now her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) raptures might well be over;
for Edmund was so struck with the circumstance, so delighted with what
Miss Crawford had done, so gratified by such a coincidence of conduct
between them, that Fanny could not but admit the superior power of one
pleasure over his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own mind, though it might have its drawback. It was
some time before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could get his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plan, or any answer
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) demand of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinion: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was in a reverie of fond reflection,
uttering only now and then a few half-sentences of praise; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
did awake and understand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was very decided in opposing what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wished.

<p/>"Return the necklace! No, my dear Fanny, upon no account. It would be
mortifying her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) severely. There can hardly be a more unpleasant
sensation than the having anything returned on our hands which we have
given with a reasonable hope of its contributing to the comfort of a
friend. Why should she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lose a pleasure which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has shewn herself so
deserving of?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If it had been given to me in the first instance,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, "I
should not have thought of returning it; but being her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother’s
present, is not it fair to suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would rather not part with
it, when it is not wanted?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must not suppose it not wanted, not acceptable, at least: and its
having been originally her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother’s gift makes no difference; for as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was not prevented from offering, nor you from taking it on that
account, it ought not to prevent you from keeping it. No doubt it is
handsomer than mine, and fitter for a ballroom."

<p/>"No, it is not handsomer, not at all handsomer in its way, and, for my
purpose, not half so fit. The chain will agree with William’s cross
beyond all comparison better than the necklace."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For one night, Fanny, for only one night, if it _be_ a sacrifice; I am
sure you will, upon consideration, make that sacrifice rather than give
pain to one who has been so studious of your comfort. Miss Crawford’s
attentions to you have been—not more than you were justly entitled to—I
am the last person to think that _could_ _be_, but they have been
invariable; and to be returning them with what must have something the
_air_ of ingratitude, though I know it could never have the _meaning_,
is not in your nature, I am sure. Wear the necklace, as you are engaged
to do, to-morrow evening, and let the chain, which was not ordered with
any reference to the ball, be kept for commoner occasions. This is my
advice. I would not have the shadow of a coolness between the two whose
intimacy I have been observing with the greatest pleasure, and in whose
characters there is so much general resemblance in true generosity and
natural delicacy as to make the few slight differences, resulting
principally from situation, no reasonable hindrance to a perfect
friendship. I would not have the shadow of a coolness arise,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>)
repeated, his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) voice sinking a little, "between the two dearest objects
I have on earth."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) was gone as he (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) spoke; and Fanny remained to tranquillise herself as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) two dearest—that must support her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). But
the other: the first! She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) speak so openly before,
and though it told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) no more than what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had long perceived, it was
a stab, for it told of his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) own convictions and views. They were
decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) would marry Miss Crawford. It was a stab, in spite of every
long-standing expectation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was obliged to repeat again and
again, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was one of his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) two dearest, before the words gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
any sensation. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) believe Miss Crawford to deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>), it would
be—oh, how different would it be—how far more tolerable! But he (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) was
deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>): he (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had not; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) faults were
what they had ever been, but he (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) saw them no longer. Till she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had shed
many tears over this deception, Fanny could not subdue her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agitation;
and the dejection which followed could only be relieved by the
influence of fervent prayers for his (<font color='blue'><b>characters</b></font>) happiness.

<p/>It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) intention, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) duty, to try to overcome
all that was excessive, all that bordered on selfishness, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
affection for Edmund. To call or to fancy it a loss, a disappointment,
would be a presumption for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not words strong enough to
satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own humility. To think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) as Miss Crawford might be
justified in thinking, would in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) be insanity. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could be
nothing under any circumstances; nothing dearer than a friend. Why did
such an idea occur to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) even enough to be reprobated and forbidden?
It ought not to have touched on the confines of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would endeavour to be rational, and to deserve the right of judging of
Miss Crawford’s character, and the privilege of true solicitude for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
by a sound intellect and an honest heart.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had all the heroism of principle, and was determined to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
duty; but having also many of the feelings of youth and nature, let her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
not be much wondered at, if, after making all these good resolutions on
the side of self-government, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) seized the scrap of paper on which
Edmund had begun writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as a treasure beyond all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hopes,
and reading with the tenderest emotion these words, "My very dear
Fanny, you must do me the favour to accept" locked it up with the
chain, as the dearest part of the gift. It was the only thing
approaching to a letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might
never receive another; it was impossible that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever should receive
another so perfectly gratifying in the occasion and the style. Two
lines more prized had never fallen from the pen of the most
distinguished author—never more completely blessed the researches of
the fondest biographer. The enthusiasm of a woman’s love is even beyond
the biographer’s. To her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), the handwriting itself, independent of
anything it may convey, is a blessedness. Never were such characters
cut by any other human being as Edmund’s commonest handwriting gave!
This specimen, written in haste as it was, had not a fault; and there
was a felicity in the flow of the first four words, in the arrangement
of <div class="bookquote">"My very dear Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have looked at for ever.

<p/>Having regulated her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts and comforted her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings by this happy
mixture of reason and weakness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was able in due time to go down and
resume her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) usual employments near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram, and pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the
usual observances without any apparent want of spirits.

<p/>Thursday, predestined to hope and enjoyment, came; and opened with more
kindness to Fanny than such self-willed, unmanageable days often
volunteer, for soon after breakfast a very friendly note was brought
from Mr. Crawford to William, stating that as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found himself obliged
to go to London on the morrow for a few days, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not help trying
to procure a companion; and therefore hoped that if William could make
up his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) mind to leave Mansfield half a day earlier than had been
proposed, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would accept a place in his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) carriage. Mr. Crawford meant
to be in town by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) uncle’s accustomary late dinner-hour, and William
was invited to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) at the Admiral’s. The proposal was a very
pleasant one to William himself, who enjoyed the idea of travelling
post with four horses, and such a good-humoured, agreeable friend; and,
in likening it to going up with despatches, was saying at once
everything in favour of its happiness and dignity which his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) imagination
could suggest; and Fanny, from a different motive, was exceedingly
pleased; for the original plan was that William should go up by the
mail from Northampton the following night, which would not have allowed
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) an hour’s rest before he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must have got into a Portsmouth coach; and
though this offer of Mr. Crawford’s would rob her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of many hours of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
company, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was too happy in having William spared from the fatigue of
such a journey, to think of anything else. Sir Thomas approved of it
for another reason. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nephew’s introduction to Admiral Crawford might
be of service. The Admiral, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) believed, had interest. Upon the whole,
it was a very joyous note. Fanny’s spirits lived on it half the
morning, deriving some accession of pleasure from its writer being
himself to go away.

<p/>As for the ball, so near at hand, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had too many agitations and fears
to have half the enjoyment in anticipation which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to have had,
or must have been supposed to have by the many young ladies looking
forward to the same event in situations more at ease, but under
circumstances of less novelty, less interest, less peculiar
gratification, than would be attributed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Miss Price, known only
by name to half the people invited, was now to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) first
appearance, and must be regarded as the queen of the evening. Who could
be happier than Miss Price? But Miss Price had not been brought up to
the trade of _coming_ _out_; and had she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) known in what light this ball
was, in general, considered respecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>), it would very much have
lessened her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) comfort by increasing the fears she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) already had of doing
wrong and being looked at. To dance without much observation or any
extraordinary fatigue, to have strength and partners for about half the
evening, to dance a little with Edmund, and not a great deal with Mr.
Crawford, to see William enjoy himself, and be able to keep away from
her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) aunt Norris, was the height of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) ambition, and seemed to
comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) greatest possibility of happiness. As these were the
best of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) hopes, they could not always prevail; and in the course of
a long morning, spent principally with her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) two aunts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was often
under the influence of much less sanguine views. William, determined to
make this last day a day of thorough enjoyment, was out snipe-shooting;
Edmund, she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) had too much reason to suppose, was at the Parsonage; and
left alone to bear the worrying of Mrs. Norris, who was cross because
the housekeeper would have her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) own way with the supper, and whom _she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>)_
could not avoid though the housekeeper might, Fanny was worn down at
last to think everything an evil belonging to the ball, and when sent
off with a parting worry to dress, moved as languidly towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
room, and felt as incapable of happiness as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been allowed no
share in it.

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked slowly upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought of yesterday; it had been
about the same hour that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had returned from the Parsonage, and found
Edmund in the East room. <div class="bookquote">"Suppose I were to find him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) there again
to-day!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to herself, in a fond indulgence of fancy.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Fanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>said a voice at that moment near her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Starting and looking up,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw, across the lobby she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had just reached, Edmund himself,
standing at the head of a different staircase. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) came towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
"You look tired and fagged, Fanny. You have been walking too far."

<p/>"No, I have not been out at all."

<p/>"Then you have had fatigues within doors, which are worse. You had
better have gone out."

<p/>Fanny, not liking to complain, found it easiest to make no answer; and
though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) usual kindness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
soon ceased to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) countenance. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did not appear in spirits:
something unconnected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was probably amiss. They proceeded
upstairs together, their rooms being on the same floor above.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I come from Dr. Grant’s,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund presently. <div class="bookquote">"You may guess my
errand there, Fanny."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>And he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) looked so conscious, that Fanny could
think but of one errand, which turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) too sick for speech. <div class="bookquote">"I
wished to engage Miss Crawford for the two first dances,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>was the
explanation that followed, and brought Fanny to life again, enabling
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was expected to speak, to utter something like an
inquiry as to the result.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) answered, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is engaged to me; but<div class="bookquote">" (with a smile that did
not sit easy) " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says it is to be the last time that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ever will
dance with me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is not serious. I think, I hope, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is
not serious; but I would rather not hear it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never has danced with
a clergyman, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) says, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never _will_. For my own sake, I could
wish there had been no ball just at—I mean not this very week, this
very day; to-morrow I leave home."

<p/>Fanny struggled for speech, and said, "I am very sorry that anything
has occurred to distress you. This ought to be a day of pleasure. My
uncle meant it so."

<p/>"Oh yes, yes! and it will be a day of pleasure. It will all end right.
I am only vexed for a moment. In fact, it is not that I consider the
ball as ill-timed; what does it signify? But, Fanny,<div class="bookquote">" stopping her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), by
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and speaking low and seriously, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>you know what all
this means. You see how it is; and could tell me, perhaps better than I
could tell you, how and why I am vexed. Let me talk to you a little.
You are a kind, kind listener. I have been pained by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) manner this
morning, and cannot get the better of it. I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) disposition to be
as sweet and faultless as your own, but the influence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) former
companions makes her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seem—gives to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) professed
opinions, sometimes a tinge of wrong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not _think_ evil, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) speaks it, speaks it in playfulness; and though I know it to be
playfulness, it grieves me to the soul."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The effect of education,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny gently.

<p/>Edmund could not but agree to it. "Yes, that uncle and aunt! They have
injured the finest mind; for sometimes, Fanny, I own to you, it does
appear more than manner: it appears as if the mind itself was tainted."

<p/>Fanny imagined this to be an appeal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment, and therefore,
after a moment’s consideration, said, "If you only want me as a
listener, cousin, I will be as useful as I can; but I am not qualified
for an adviser. Do not ask advice of _me_. I am not competent."

<p/>"You are right, Fanny, to protest against such an office, but you need
not be afraid. It is a subject on which I should never ask advice; it
is the sort of subject on which it had better never be asked; and few,
I imagine, do ask it, but when they want to be influenced against their
conscience. I only want to talk to you."

<p/>"One thing more. Excuse the liberty; but take care _how_ you talk to
me. Do not tell me anything now, which hereafter you may be sorry for.
The time may come—<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The colour rushed into her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) spoke.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Dearest Fanny!" cried Edmund, pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) lips with
almost as much warmth as if it had been Miss Crawford’s, "you are all
considerate thought! But it is unnecessary here. The time will never
come. No such time as you allude to will ever come. I begin to think it
most improbable: the chances grow less and less; and even if it should,
there will be nothing to be remembered by either you or me that we need
be afraid of, for I can never be ashamed of my own scruples; and if
they are removed, it must be by changes that will only raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
character the more by the recollection of the faults she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) once had. You
are the only being upon earth to whom I should say what I have said;
but you have always known my opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); you can bear me witness,
Fanny, that I have never been blinded. How many a time have we talked
over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little errors! You need not fear me; I have almost given up
every serious idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but I must be a blockhead indeed, if,
whatever befell me, I could think of your kindness and sympathy without
the sincerest gratitude."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had said enough to shake the experience of eighteen. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had said
enough to give Fanny some happier feelings than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lately known,
and with a brighter look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) answered, "Yes, cousin, I am convinced
that _you_ would be incapable of anything else, though perhaps some
might not. I cannot be afraid of hearing anything you wish to say. Do
not check yourself. Tell me whatever you like."

<p/>They were now on the second floor, and the appearance of a housemaid
prevented any farther conversation. For Fanny’s present comfort it was
concluded, perhaps, at the happiest moment: had he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) been able to talk
another five minutes, there is no saying that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) might not have talked
away all Miss Crawford’s faults and his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) own despondence. But as it was,
they parted with looks on his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) side of grateful affection, and with some
very precious sensations on hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had felt nothing like it for
hours. Since the first joy from Mr. Crawford’s note to William had worn
away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been in a state absolutely the reverse; there had been no
comfort around, no hope within her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Now everything was smiling.
William’s good fortune returned again upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind, and seemed of
greater value than at first. The ball, too—such an evening of pleasure
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)! It was now a real animation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) began to dress for it
with much of the happy flutter which belongs to a ball. All went well:
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own looks; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) came to the necklaces
again, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good fortune seemed complete, for upon trial the one given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) by Miss Crawford would by no means go through the ring of the
cross. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had, to oblige Edmund, resolved to wear it; but it was too
large for the purpose. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), therefore, must be worn; and having, with
delightful feelings, joined the chain and the cross—those memorials of
the two most beloved of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart, those dearest tokens so formed for
each other by everything real and imaginary—and put them round her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
neck, and seen and felt how full of William and Edmund they were, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
was able, without an effort, to resolve on wearing Miss Crawford’s
necklace too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acknowledged it to be right. Miss Crawford had a
claim; and when it was no longer to encroach on, to interfere with the
stronger claims, the truer kindness of another, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could do her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
justice even with pleasure to herself. The necklace really looked very
well; and Fanny left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) room at last, comfortably satisfied with
herself and all about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Bertram had recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) on this occasion with an unusual
degree of wakefulness. It had really occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), unprompted, that
Fanny, preparing for a ball, might be glad of better help than the
upper housemaid’s, and when dressed herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) actually sent her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>) own
maid to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>housemaid</b></font>); too late, of course, to be of any use. Mrs. Chapman
had just reached the attic floor, when Miss Price came out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) room
completely dressed, and only civilities were necessary; but Fanny felt
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s attention almost as much as Lady Bertram or Mrs. Chapman
could do themselves.
