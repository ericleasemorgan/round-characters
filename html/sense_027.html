<p/><div class="bookquote">"If this open weather holds much longer,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, when they
met at breakfast the following morning, "Sir John will not like leaving
Barton next week; ’tis a sad thing for sportsmen to lose a day’s
pleasure. Poor souls! I always pity them when they do; they seem to
take it so much to heart."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, in a cheerful voice, and walking to the
window as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke, to examine the day. "I had not thought of _that_.
This weather will keep many sportsmen in the country.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>It was a lucky recollection, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) good spirits were restored by it.
" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is charming weather for _them_ indeed," she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) continued, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat
down to the breakfast table with a happy countenance. "How much they
must enjoy it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot be
expected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such a
series of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frosts
will soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another day
or two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer—nay,
perhaps it may freeze tonight!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"At any rate,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, wishing to prevent Mrs. Jennings from
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister’s thoughts as clearly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) did, "I dare say we
shall have Sir John and Lady Middleton in town by the end of next
week."

<p/>"Ay, my dear, I’ll warrant you we do. Mary always has her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own way."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>silently conjectured Elinor, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) will write to Combe by
this day’s post."

<p/>But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) _did_, the letter was written and sent away with a privacy
which eluded all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) watchfulness to ascertain the fact. Whatever the
truth of it might be, and far as Elinor was from feeling thorough
contentment about it, yet while she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) saw Marianne in spirits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could
not be very uncomfortable herself. And Marianne was in spirits; happy
in the mildness of the weather, and still happier in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expectation of
a frost.

<p/>The morning was chiefly spent in leaving cards at the houses of Mrs.
Jennings’s acquaintance to inform them of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) being in town; and
Marianne was all the time busy in observing the direction of the wind,
watching the variations of the sky and imagining an alteration in the
air.

<p/>"Don’t you find it colder than it was in the morning, Elinor? There
seems to me a very decided difference. I can hardly keep my hands warm
even in my muff. It was not so yesterday, I think. The clouds seem
parting too, the sun will be out in a moment, and we shall have a clear
afternoon."

<p/>Elinor was alternately diverted and pained; but Marianne persevered,
and saw every night in the brightness of the fire, and every morning in
the appearance of the atmosphere, the certain symptoms of approaching
frost.

<p/>The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs.
Jennings’s style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
behaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
household arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, and
excepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton’s regret, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
had never dropped, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) visited no one to whom an introduction could at
all discompose the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) young companions. Pleased to find
herself more comfortably situated in that particular than she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had
expected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much real
enjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home or
abroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/>Colonel Brandon, who had a general invitation to the house, was with
them almost every day; he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) came to look at Marianne and talk to Elinor,
who often derived more satisfaction from conversing with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) than from
any other daily occurrence, but who saw at the same time with much
concern his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) continued regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feared it was a
strengthening regard. It grieved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to see the earnestness with which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) often watched Marianne, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) spirits were certainly worse than
when at Barton.

<p/>About a week after their arrival, it became certain that Willoughby was
also arrived. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) card was on the table when they came in from the
morning’s drive.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Good God!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, "he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) has been here while we were out."
Elinor, rejoiced to be assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) being in London, now ventured to
say, <div class="bookquote">"Depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) will call again tomorrow."  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>But Marianne seemed
hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and on Mrs. Jennings’s entrance, escaped with the
precious card.

<p/>This event, while it raised the spirits of Elinor, restored to those of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister all, and more than all, their former agitation. From this
moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind was never quiet; the expectation of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) every
hour of the day, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) unfit for any thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) insisted on being
left behind, the next morning, when the others went out.

<p/>Elinor’s thoughts were full of what might be passing in Berkeley Street
during their absence; but a moment’s glance at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister when they
returned was enough to inform her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that Willoughby had paid no second
visit there. A note was just then brought in, and laid on the table.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For me!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne, stepping hastily forward.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, ma’am, for my mistress."

 (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div><p/>But Marianne, not convinced, took it instantly up.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is indeed for Mrs. Jennings; how provoking!"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"You are expecting a letter, then?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, unable to be longer
silent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, a little—not much."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>After a short pause. <div class="bookquote">"You have no confidence in me, Marianne."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Nay, Elinor, this reproach from _you_—you who have confidence in no
one!"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Me!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>returned Elinor in some confusion; <div class="bookquote">"indeed, Marianne, I have
nothing to tell."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/>"Nor I,<div class="bookquote">" answered Marianne with energy, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>our situations then are alike.
We have neither of us any thing to tell; you, because you do not
communicate, and I, because I conceal nothing."

<p/>Elinor, distressed by this charge of reserve in herself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
not at liberty to do away, knew not how, under such circumstances, to
press for greater openness in Marianne.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) read it
aloud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in Conduit
Street the night before, and requesting the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and
cousins the following evening. Business on Sir John’s part, and a
violent cold on her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street.
The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drew
near, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, that
they should both attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) on such a visit, Elinor had some difficulty
in persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister to go, for still she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen nothing of
Willoughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad,
than unwilling to run the risk of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) calling again in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) absence.

<p/>Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is not
materially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settled
in town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), nearly twenty
young people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair,
however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, an
unpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where the
reputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, it
was risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have it
known that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or nine
couple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they had
not seen before since their arrival in town, as he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) was careful to avoid
the appearance of any attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) mother-in-law, and therefore
never came near her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), they received no mark of recognition on their
entrance. He (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>) looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who they
were, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of the
room. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entered: it
was enough—_he (<font color='blue'><b>their</b></font>)_ was not there—and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat down, equally ill-disposed to
receive or communicate pleasure. After they had been assembled about an
hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
surprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been first
informed of their arrival at his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) house, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had himself said
something very droll on hearing that they were to come.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I thought you were both in Devonshire,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did you?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When do you go back again?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And thus ended their discourse.

<p/>Never had Marianne been so unwilling to dance in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) life, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
that evening, and never so much fatigued by the exercise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
complained of it as they returned to Berkeley Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Aye, aye,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Jennings, <div class="bookquote">"we know the reason of all that very
well; if a certain person who shall be nameless, had been there, you
would not have been a bit tired: and to say the truth it was not very
pretty of him (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not to give you the meeting when he (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was invited."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Jennings</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Invited!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So my daughter Middleton told me, for it seems Sir John met him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
somewhere in the street this morning."  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>Marianne said no more, but
looked exceedingly hurt. Impatient in this situation to be doing
something that might lead to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s relief, Elinor resolved to
write the next morning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, and hoped by awakening her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fears
for the health of Marianne, to procure those inquiries which had been
so long delayed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was still more eagerly bent on this measure by
perceiving after breakfast on the morrow, that Marianne was again
writing to Willoughby, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not suppose it to be to any other
person.

<p/>About the middle of the day, Mrs. Jennings went out by herself on
business, and Elinor began her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter directly, while Marianne, too
restless for employment, too anxious for conversation, walked from one
window to the other, or sat down by the fire in melancholy meditation.
Elinor was very earnest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother, relating all
that had passed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) suspicions of Willoughby’s inconstancy, urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
by every plea of duty and affection to demand from Marianne an account
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) real situation with respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) letter was scarcely finished, when a rap foretold a visitor, and
Colonel Brandon was announced. Marianne, who had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) from the
window, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
entered it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) looked more than usually grave, and though expressing
satisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had somewhat in
particular to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), sat for some time without saying a word.
Elinor, persuaded that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had some communication to make in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not the
first time of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more than
once before, beginning with the observation of <div class="bookquote">"your sister looks
unwell to-day,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">"your sister seems out of spirits,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had appeared
on the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, something
particular about her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). After a pause of several minutes, their silence
was broken, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) asking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in a voice of some agitation, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was
to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was not
prepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obliged
to adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) meant? He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
tried to smile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">"your sister’s engagement to Mr.
Willoughby is very generally known."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"It cannot be generally known,<div class="bookquote">" returned Elinor, " (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own family do
not know it."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looked surprised and said, <div class="bookquote">"I beg your pardon, I am afraid my
inquiry has been impertinent; but I had not supposed any secrecy
intended, as they openly correspond, and their marriage is universally
talked of."

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>"How can that be? By whom can you have heard it mentioned?"

<p/>"By many—by some of whom you know nothing, by others with whom you are
most intimate, Mrs. Jennings, Mrs. Palmer, and the Middletons. But
still I might not have believed it, for where the mind is perhaps
rather unwilling to be convinced, it will always find something to
support its doubts, if I had not, when the servant let me in today,
accidentally seen a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) hand, directed to Mr. Willoughby in
your sister’s writing. I came to inquire, but I was convinced before I
could ask the question. Is every thing finally settled? Is it
impossible to—? But I have no right, and I could have no chance of
succeeding. Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong in
saying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence I
have the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutely
resolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, if
concealment be possible, is all that remains.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) love for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not immediately able to say
anything, and even when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) spirits were recovered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) debated for a
short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The real
state of things between Willoughby and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister was so little known
to herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might be as liable
to say too much as too little. Yet as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was convinced that Marianne’s
affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of Colonel Brandon’s
success, whatever the event of that affection might be, and at the same
time wished to shield her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) conduct from censure, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) thought it most
prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really
knew or believed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) acknowledged, therefore, that though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
never been informed by themselves of the terms on which they stood with
each other, of their mutual affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had no doubt, and of their
correspondence she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was not astonished to hear.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with silent attention, and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) ceasing to speak,
rose directly from his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) seat, and after saying in a voice of emotion,
" (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>to your sister I wish all imaginable happiness; to Willoughby that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
may endeavour to deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>),"—took leave, and went away.

<p/>Elinor derived no comfortable feelings from this conversation, to
lessen the uneasiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind on other points; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was left, on the
contrary, with a melancholy impression of Colonel Brandon’s
unhappiness, and was prevented even from wishing it removed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
anxiety for the very event that must confirm it.
