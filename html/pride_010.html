<p/>The day passed much as the day before had done. Mrs. Hurst and
Miss Bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the
invalid, who continued, though slowly, to mend; and in the
evening Elizabeth joined their party in the drawing-room. The
loo-table, however, did not appear. Mr. Darcy was writing, and
Miss Bingley, seated near him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), was watching the progress of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
letter and repeatedly calling off his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attention by messages to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister. Mr. Hurst and Mr. Bingley were at piquet, and Mrs.
Hurst was observing their game.

<p/>Elizabeth took up some needlework, and was sufficiently amused in
attending to what passed between Darcy and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) companion. The
perpetual commendations of the lady, either on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) handwriting,
or on the evenness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lines, or on the length of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter,
with the perfect unconcern with which her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) praises were received,
formed a curious dialogue, and was exactly in union with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
opinion of each.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How delighted Miss Darcy will be to receive such a letter!"

 (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) made no answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You write uncommonly fast."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"You are mistaken. I write rather slowly."

<p/>"How many letters you must have occasion to write in the course
of a year! Letters of business, too! How odious I should think
them!"

<p/>"It is fortunate, then, that they fall to my lot instead of
yours."

<p/>"Pray tell your sister that I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)."

<p/>"I have already told her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so once, by your desire."

<p/>"I am afraid you do not like your pen. Let me mend it for you. I
mend pens remarkably well."

<p/>"Thank you—but I always mend my own."

<p/>"How can you contrive to write so even?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Tell your sister I am delighted to hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) improvement on
the harp; and pray let her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) know that I am quite in raptures with
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) beautiful little design for a table, and I think it
infinitely superior to Miss Grantley’s."

<p/>"Will you give me leave to defer your raptures till I write
again? At present I have not room to do them justice."

<p/>"Oh! it is of no consequence. I shall see her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in January. But do
you always write such charming long letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), Mr. Darcy?"

<p/>"They are generally long; but whether always charming it is not
for me to determine."

<p/>"It is a rule with me, that a person who can write a long letter
with ease, cannot write ill."

<p/>"That will not do for a compliment to Darcy, Caroline,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>)
brother, " (<font color='red'><b>Caroline</b></font>)</div>because he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does _not_ write with ease. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) studies too
much for words of four syllables. Do not you, Darcy?"

<p/>"My style of writing is very different from yours."

<p/>"Oh!" cried Miss Bingley, "Charles writes in the most careless
way imaginable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) leaves out half his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) words, and blots the
rest."

<p/>"My ideas flow so rapidly that I have not time to express them—by
which means my letters sometimes convey no ideas at all to my
correspondents."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your humility, Mr. Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "must disarm
reproof."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nothing is more deceitful,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, "than the appearance of
humility. It is often only carelessness of opinion, and sometimes
an indirect boast."

<p/>"And which of the two do you call _my_ little recent piece of
modesty?"

<p/>"The indirect boast; for you are really proud of your defects in
writing, because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity
of thought and carelessness of execution, which, if not
estimable, you think at least highly interesting. The power of
doing anything with quickness is always prized much by the
possessor, and often without any attention to the imperfection of
the performance. When you told Mrs. Bennet this morning that if
you ever resolved upon quitting Netherfield you should be gone in
five minutes, you meant it to be a sort of panegyric, of
compliment to yourself—and yet what is there so very laudable in
a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone,
and can be of no real advantage to yourself or anyone else?"

<p/>"Nay," cried Bingley, "this is too much, to remember at night all
the foolish things that were said in the morning. And yet, upon
my honour, I believe what I said of myself to be true, and I
believe it at this moment. At least, therefore, I did not assume
the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before
the ladies."

<p/>"I dare say you believed it; but I am by no means convinced that
you would be gone with such celerity. Your conduct would be quite
as dependent on chance as that of any man I know; and if, as you
were mounting your horse, a friend were to say, <div class="bookquote">‘Bingley, you had
better stay till next week,’  (<font color='red'><b>a friend</b></font>)</div>you would probably do it, you would
probably not go—and at another word, might stay a month."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have only proved by this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>cried Elizabeth, "that Mr.
Bingley did not do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own disposition. You have shown
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) off now much more than he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did himself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am exceedingly gratified,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley, "by your converting
what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my
temper. But I am afraid you are giving it a turn which that
gentleman did by no means intend; for he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) would certainly think
better of me, if under such a circumstance I were to give a flat
denial, and ride off as fast as I could."

<p/>"Would Mr. Darcy then consider the rashness of your original
intentions as atoned for by your obstinacy in adhering to it?"

<p/>"Upon my word, I cannot exactly explain the matter; Darcy must
speak for himself."

<p/>"You expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call
mine, but which I have never acknowledged. Allowing the case,
however, to stand according to your representation, you must
remember, Miss Bennet, that the friend who is supposed to desire
his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) return to the house, and the delay of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) plan, has merely
desired it, asked it without offering one argument in favour of
its propriety."

<p/>"To yield readily—easily—to the _persuasion_ of a friend is no
merit with you."

<p/>"To yield without conviction is no compliment to the
understanding of either."

<p/>"You appear to me, Mr. Darcy, to allow nothing for the influence
of friendship and affection. A regard for the requester would
often make one readily yield to a request, without waiting for
arguments to reason one into it. I am not particularly speaking
of such a case as you have supposed about Mr. Bingley. We may as
well wait, perhaps, till the circumstance occurs before we
discuss the discretion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaviour thereupon. But in general
and ordinary cases between friend and friend, where one of them
is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great
moment, should you think ill of that person for complying with
the desire, without waiting to be argued into it?"

<p/>"Will it not be advisable, before we proceed on this subject, to
arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which
is to appertain to this request, as well as the degree of
intimacy subsisting between the parties?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"By all means,"  (<font color='red'><b>Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Bingley; "let us hear all the particulars,
not forgetting their comparative height and size; for that will
have more weight in the argument, Miss Bennet, than you may be
aware of. I assure you, that if Darcy were not such a great tall
fellow, in comparison with myself, I should not pay him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) half so
much deference. I declare I do not know a more awful object than
Darcy, on particular occasions, and in particular places; at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
own house especially, and of a Sunday evening, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has
nothing to do."

<p/>Mr. Darcy smiled; but Elizabeth thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could perceive that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was rather offended, and therefore checked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) laugh. Miss
Bingley warmly resented the indignity he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had received, in an
expostulation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother for talking such nonsense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I see your design, Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend. <div class="bookquote">"You dislike an
argument, and want to silence this."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"Perhaps I do. Arguments are too much like disputes. If you and
Miss Bennet will defer yours till I am out of the room, I shall
be very thankful; and then you may say whatever you like of me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What you ask,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "is no sacrifice on my side; and
Mr. Darcy had much better finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter."

<p/>Mr. Darcy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) advice, and did finish his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter.

<p/>When that business was over, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) applied to Miss Bingley and
Elizabeth for an indulgence of some music. Miss Bingley moved
with some alacrity to the pianoforte; and, after a polite request
that Elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and
more earnestly negatived, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seated herself.

<p/>Mrs. Hurst sang with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister, and while they were thus
employed, Elizabeth could not help observing, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned over
some music-books that lay on the instrument, how frequently Mr.
Darcy’s eyes were fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hardly knew how to suppose
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could be an object of admiration to so great a man; and
yet that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) disliked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), was still
more strange. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could only imagine, however, at last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
drew his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) notice because there was something more wrong and
reprehensible, according to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ideas of right, than in any other
person present. The supposition did not pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
too little to care for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) approbation.

<p/>After playing some Italian songs, Miss Bingley varied the charm
by a lively Scotch air; and soon afterwards Mr. Darcy, drawing
near Elizabeth, said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>):

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not you feel a great inclination, Miss Bennet, to seize such
an opportunity of dancing a reel?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) smiled, but made no answer. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) repeated the question, with
some surprise at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) silence.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), "I heard you before, but I could not immediately
determine what to say in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say
<div class="bookquote">‘Yes,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste;
but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and
cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have,
therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to
dance a reel at all—and now despise me if you dare."

<p/>"Indeed I do not dare."

<p/>Elizabeth, having rather expected to affront him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), was amazed at
his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) gallantry; but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner which made it difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to affront anybody;
and Darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was by
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) really believed, that were it not for the inferiority of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) connections, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should be in some danger.

<p/>Miss Bingley saw, or suspected enough to be jealous; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
great anxiety for the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) dear friend Jane received
some assistance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) desire of getting rid of Elizabeth.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) often tried to provoke Darcy into disliking her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) guest, by
talking of their supposed marriage, and planning his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) happiness in
such an alliance.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), as they were walking together in the
shrubbery the next day, "you will give your mother-in-law a few
hints, when this desirable event takes place, as to the advantage
of holding her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) tongue; and if you can compass it, do cure the
younger girls of running after officers. And, if I may mention so
delicate a subject, endeavour to check that little something,
bordering on conceit and impertinence, which your lady
possesses."

<p/>"Have you anything else to propose for my domestic felicity?"

<p/>"Oh! yes. Do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt Phillips be
placed in the gallery at Pemberley. Put them next to your
great-uncle the judge. They are in the same profession, you know,
only in different lines. As for your Elizabeth’s picture, you
must not have it taken, for what painter could do justice to
those beautiful eyes?"

<p/>"It would not be easy, indeed, to catch their expression, but
their colour and shape, and the eyelashes, so remarkably fine,
might be copied.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>At that moment they were met from another walk by Mrs. Hurst and
Elizabeth herself.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I did not know that you intended to walk," said Miss Bingley, in
some confusion, lest they had been overheard.

<p/>"You used us abominably ill," answered Mrs. Hurst, "running away
without telling us that you were coming out."

<p/>Then taking the disengaged arm of Mr. Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) left Elizabeth
to walk by herself. The path just admitted three. Mr. Darcy felt
their rudeness, and immediately said:

<p/>"This walk is not wide enough for our party. We had better go
into the avenue."

<p/>But Elizabeth, who had not the least inclination to remain with
them, laughingly answered:

<p/>"No, no; stay where you are. You are charmingly grouped, and
appear to uncommon advantage. The picturesque would be spoilt by
admitting a fourth. Good-bye."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) then ran gaily off, rejoicing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rambled about, in the
hope of being at home again in a day or two. Jane was already so
much recovered as to intend leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) room for a couple of
hours that evening.
