<p/>It may be possible to do without dancing entirely. Instances have been known of young people passing many, many months successively, without being at any ball of any description, and no material injury accrue either to body or mind; but when a beginning is made when the felicities of rapid motion have once been, though slightly, felt it must be a very heavy set that does not ask for more.

<p/>Frank Churchill had danced once at Highbury, and longed to dance again; and the last half-hour of an evening which Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to spend with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter at Randalls, was passed by the two young people in schemes on the subject. Frank's was the first idea; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) the greatest zeal in pursuing it; for the lady was the best judge of the difficulties, and the most solicitous for accommodation and appearance. But still she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had inclination enough for shewing people again how delightfully Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse danced for doing that in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) need not blush to compare herself with Jane Fairfax and even for simple dancing itself, without any of the wicked aids of vanity to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) first in pacing out the room they were in to see what it could be made to hold and then in taking the dimensions of the other parlour, in the hope of discovering, in spite of all that Mr. Weston could say of their exactly equal size, that it was a little the largest.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) first proposition and request, that the dance begun at Mr. Cole's should be finished there that the same party should be collected, and the same musician engaged, met with the readiest acquiescence. Mr. Weston entered into the idea with thorough enjoyment, and Mrs. Weston most willingly undertook to play as long as they could wish to dance; and the interesting employment had followed, of reckoning up exactly who there would be, and portioning out the indispensable division of space to every couple.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>had been repeated many times over. "And there will be the two Gilberts, young Cox, my father, and myself, besides Mr. Knightley. Yes, that will be quite enough for pleasure. You and Miss Smith, and Miss Fairfax, will be three, and the two Miss Coxes five; and for five couple there will be plenty of room.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But soon it came to be on one side,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>couple</b></font>)</div>But will there be good room for five couple? I really do not think there will.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>On another,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>couple</b></font>)</div>And after all, five couple are not enough to make it worth while to stand up. Five couple are nothing, when one thinks seriously about it. It will not do to invite five couple. It can be allowable only as the thought of the moment."

<p/>Somebody said that Miss Gilbert was expected at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) brother's, and must be invited with the rest. Somebody else believed Mrs. Gilbert would have danced the other evening, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gilbert</b></font>) had been asked. A word was put in for a second young Cox; and at last, Mr. Weston naming one family of cousins who must be included, and another of very old acquaintance who could not be left out, it became a certainty that the five couple would be at least ten, and a very interesting speculation in what possible manner they could be disposed of.

<p/>The doors of the two rooms were just opposite each other. <div class="bookquote">"Might not they use both rooms, and dance across the passage?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It seemed the best scheme; and yet it was not so good but that many of them wanted a better. Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health. It made him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) so very unhappy, indeed, that it could not be persevered in.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! no,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>); "it would be the extreme of imprudence. I could not bear it for Emma! Emma is not strong. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would catch a dreadful cold. So would poor little Harriet. So you would all. Mrs. Weston, you would be quite laid up; do not let them talk of such a wild thing. Pray do not let them talk of it. That young man (speaking lower) is very thoughtless. Do not tell his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father, but that young man is not quite the thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been opening the doors very often this evening, and keeping them open very inconsiderately. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not think of the draught. I do not mean to set you against him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), but indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not quite the thing!"

<p/>Mrs. Weston was sorry for such a charge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew the importance of it, and said every thing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) power to do it away. Every door was now closed, the passage plan given up, and the first scheme of dancing only in the room they were in resorted to again; and with such good-will on Frank Churchill's part, that the space which a quarter of an hour before had been deemed barely sufficient for five couple, was now endeavoured to be made out quite enough for ten.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We were too magnificent,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). "We allowed unnecessary room. Ten couple may stand here very well.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma demurred. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It would be a crowd a sad crowd; and what could be worse than dancing without space to turn in?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gravely replied; "it was very bad." But still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) went on measuring, and still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ended with,

<p/>"I think there will be very tolerable room for ten couple."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, no,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "you are quite unreasonable. It would be dreadful to be standing so close! Nothing can be farther from pleasure than to be dancing in a crowd and a crowd in a little room!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no denying it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) replied. "I agree with you exactly. A crowd in a little room Miss Woodhouse, you have the art of giving pictures in a few words. Exquisite, quite exquisite! Still, however, having proceeded so far, one is unwilling to give the matter up. It would be a disappointment to my father and altogether I do not know that I am rather of opinion that ten couple might stand here very well."

<p/>Emma perceived that the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) gallantry was a little self-willed, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took the compliment, and forgave the rest. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) intended ever to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) preference, and the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was quite amiable enough.

<p/>Before the middle of the next day, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was at Hartfield; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) entered the room with such an agreeable smile as certified the continuance of the scheme. It soon appeared that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) came to announce an improvement.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Miss Woodhouse,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) almost immediately began, "your inclination for dancing has not been quite frightened away, I hope, by the terrors of my father's little rooms. I bring a new proposal on the subject: a thought of my father's, which waits only your approbation to be acted upon. May I hope for the honour of your hand for the two first dances of this little projected ball, to be given, not at Randalls, but at the Crown Inn?"

<p/>"The Crown!"

<p/>"Yes; if you and Mr. Woodhouse see no objection, and I trust you cannot, my father hopes his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) friends will be so kind as to visit him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) there. Better accommodations, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can promise them, and not a less grateful welcome than at Randalls. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own idea. Mrs. Weston sees no objection to it, provided you are satisfied. This is what we all feel. Oh! you were perfectly right! Ten couple, in either of the Randalls rooms, would have been insufferable! Dreadful! I felt how right you were the whole time, but was too anxious for securing any thing to like to yield. Is not it a good exchange? You consent I hope you consent?"

<p/>"It appears to me a plan that nobody can object to, if Mr. and Mrs. Weston do not. I think it admirable; and, as far as I can answer for myself, shall be most happy It seems the only improvement that could be. Papa, do you not think it an excellent improvement?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to repeat and explain it, before it was fully comprehended; and then, being quite new, farther representations were necessary to make it acceptable.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No; he (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) thought it very far from an improvement a very bad plan much worse than the other. A room at an inn was always damp and dangerous; never properly aired, or fit to be inhabited. If they must dance, they had better dance at Randalls. He (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) had never been in the room at the Crown in his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) life did not know the people who kept it by sight. Oh! no a very bad plan. They would catch worse colds at the Crown than anywhere."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I was going to observe, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, "that one of the great recommendations of this change would be the very little danger of any body's catching cold so much less danger at the Crown than at Randalls! Mr. Perry might have reason to regret the alteration, but nobody else could."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse, rather warmly, "you are very much mistaken if you suppose Mr. Perry to be that sort of character. Mr. Perry is extremely concerned when any of us are ill. But I do not understand how the room at the Crown can be safer for you than your father's house."

<p/>"From the very circumstance of its being larger, sir. We shall have no occasion to open the windows at all not once the whole evening; and it is that dreadful habit of opening the windows, letting in cold air upon heated bodies, which (as you well know, sir) does the mischief."

<p/>"Open the windows! but surely, Mr. Churchill, nobody would think of opening the windows at Randalls. Nobody could be so imprudent! I never heard of such a thing. Dancing with open windows! I am sure, neither your father nor Mrs. Weston (poor Miss Taylor that was) would suffer it."

<p/>"Ah! sir but a thoughtless young person will sometimes step behind a window-curtain, and throw up a sash, without its being suspected. I have often known it done myself."

<p/>"Have you indeed, sir? Bless me! I never could have supposed it. But I live out of the world, and am often astonished at what I hear. However, this does make a difference; and, perhaps, when we come to talk it over but these sort of things require a good deal of consideration. One cannot resolve upon them in a hurry. If Mr. and Mrs. Weston will be so obliging as to call here one morning, we may talk it over, and see what can be done."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But, unfortunately, sir, my time is so limited "

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh!" interrupted Emma, "there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over. There is no hurry at all. If it can be contrived to be at the Crown, papa, it will be very convenient for the horses. They will be so near their own stable."

<p/>"So they will, my dear. That is a great thing. Not that James ever complains; but it is right to spare our horses when we can. If I could be sure of the rooms being thoroughly aired but is Mrs. Stokes to be trusted? I doubt it. I do not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Stokes</b></font>), even by sight."

<p/>"I can answer for every thing of that nature, sir, because it will be under Mrs. Weston's care. Mrs. Weston undertakes to direct the whole."

<p/>"There, papa! Now you must be satisfied Our own dear Mrs. Weston, who is carefulness itself. Do not you remember what Mr. Perry said, so many years ago, when I had the measles? <div class="bookquote">'If Miss Taylor undertakes to wrap Miss Emma up, you need not have any fears, sir.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>How often have I heard you speak of it as such a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)!"

<p/>"Aye, very true. Mr. Perry did say so. I shall never forget it. Poor little Emma! You were very bad with the measles; that is, you would have been very bad, but for Perry's great attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) came four times a day for a week. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) said, from the first, it was a very good sort which was our great comfort; but the measles are a dreadful complaint. I hope whenever poor Isabella's little ones have the measles, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will send for Perry."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My father and Mrs. Weston are at the Crown at this moment,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, "examining the capabilities of the house. I left them there and came on to Hartfield, impatient for your opinion, and hoping you might be persuaded to join them and give your advice on the spot. I was desired to say so from both. It would be the greatest pleasure to them, if you could allow me to attend you there. They can do nothing satisfactorily without you."

<p/>Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, engaging to think it all over while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown. There were Mr. and Mrs. Weston; delighted to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and receive her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation, very busy and very happy in their different way; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), in some little distress; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), finding every thing perfect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "this paper is worse than I expected. Look! in places you see it is dreadfully dirty; and the wainscot is more yellow and forlorn than any thing I could have imagined."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear, you are too particular,"  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband. "What does all that signify? You will see nothing of it by candlelight. It will be as clean as Randalls by candlelight. We never see any thing of it on our club-nights."

<p/>The ladies here probably exchanged looks which meant, <div class="bookquote">"Men never know when things are dirty or not;"  (<font color='red'><b>The ladies</b></font>)</div>and the gentlemen perhaps thought each to himself, "Women will have their little nonsenses and needless cares."

<p/>One perplexity, however, arose, which the gentlemen did not disdain. It regarded a supper-room. At the time of the ballroom's being built, suppers had not been in question; and a small card-room adjoining, was the only addition. What was to be done? This card-room would be wanted as a card-room now; or, if cards were conveniently voted unnecessary by their four selves, still was it not too small for any comfortable supper? Another room of much better size might be secured for the purpose; but it was at the other end of the house, and a long awkward passage must be gone through to get at it. This made a difficulty. Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.

<p/>Mrs. Weston proposed having no regular supper; merely sandwiches, &c., set out in the little room; but that was scouted as a wretched suggestion. A private dance, without sitting down to supper, was pronounced an infamous fraud upon the rights of men and women; and Mrs. Weston must not speak of it again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then took another line of expediency, and looking into the doubtful room, observed,

<p/>"I do not think it is so very small. We shall not be many, you know."

<p/>And Mr. Weston at the same time, walking briskly with long steps through the passage, was calling out,

<p/>"You talk a great deal of the length of this passage, my dear. It is a mere nothing after all; and not the least draught from the stairs."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wish,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, "one could know which arrangement our guests in general would like best. To do what would be most generally pleasing must be our object if one could but tell what that would be."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>cried Frank, "very true. You want your neighbours' opinions. I do not wonder at you. If one could ascertain what the chief of them the Coles, for instance. They are not far off. Shall I call upon them? Or Miss Bates? She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is still nearer. And I do not know whether Miss Bates is not as likely to understand the inclinations of the rest of the people as any body. I think we do want a larger council. Suppose I go and invite Miss Bates to join us?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well if you please,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston rather hesitating, "if you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be of any use."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You will get nothing to the purpose from Miss Bates,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will be all delight and gratitude, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will tell you nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will not even listen to your questions. I see no advantage in consulting Miss Bates."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is so amusing, so extremely amusing! I am very fond of hearing Miss Bates talk. And I need not bring the whole family, you know.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here Mr. Weston joined them, and on hearing what was proposed, gave it his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) decided approbation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Frank/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>Aye, do, Frank. Go and fetch Miss Bates, and let us end the matter at once. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) will enjoy the scheme, I am sure; and I do not know a properer person for shewing us how to do away difficulties. Fetch Miss Bates. We are growing a little too nice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is a standing lesson of how to be happy. But fetch them both. Invite them both."

<p/>"Both sir! Can the old lady?"...

<p/>"The old lady! No, the young lady, to be sure. I shall think you a great blockhead, Frank, if you bring the aunt without the niece."

<p/>"Oh! I beg your pardon, sir. I did not immediately recollect. Undoubtedly if you wish it, I will endeavour to persuade them both.<div class="bookquote">" And away he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) ran.

<p/>Long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) reappeared, attending the short, neat, brisk-moving aunt, and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) elegant niece, Mrs. Weston, like a sweet-tempered woman and a good wife, had examined the passage again, and found the evils of it much less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had supposed before indeed very trifling; and here ended the difficulties of decision. All the rest, in speculation at least, was perfectly smooth. All the minor arrangements of table and chair, lights and music, tea and supper, made themselves; or were left as mere trifles to be settled at any time between Mrs. Weston and Mrs. Stokes. Every body invited, was certainly to come; Frank had already written to Enscombe to propose staying a few days beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) fortnight, which could not possibly be refused. And a delightful dance it was to be.

<p/>Most cordially, when Miss Bates arrived, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) agree that it must. As a counsellor she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was not wanted; but as an approver, (a much safer character,) she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was truly welcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) approbation, at once general and minute, warm and incessant, could not but please; and for another half-hour they were all walking to and fro, between the different rooms, some suggesting, some attending, and all in happy enjoyment of the future. The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, " (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) has asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), my dear. That's right. I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would!"
