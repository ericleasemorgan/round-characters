<p/>Had Elizabeth’s opinion been all drawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal
felicity or domestic comfort. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father, captivated by youth and
beauty, and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty
generally give, had married a woman whose weak understanding and
illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all
real affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). Respect, esteem, and confidence had
vanished for ever; and all his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) views of domestic happiness were
overthrown. But Mr. Bennet was not of a disposition to seek
comfort for the disappointment which his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own imprudence had
brought on, in any of those pleasures which too often console the
unfortunate for their folly or their vice. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was fond of the
country and of books; and from these tastes had arisen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
principal enjoyments. To his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was very little otherwise
indebted, than as her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) ignorance and folly had contributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
amusement. This is not the sort of happiness which a man would in
general wish to owe to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wife; but where other powers of
entertainment are wanting, the true philosopher will derive
benefit from such as are given.

<p/>Elizabeth, however, had never been blind to the impropriety of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father’s behaviour as a husband. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had always seen it with
pain; but respecting his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) abilities, and grateful for his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
affectionate treatment of herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured to forget what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not overlook, and to banish from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts that
continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which, in
exposing his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) wife to the contempt of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) own children, was so
highly reprehensible. But she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) had never felt so strongly as now
the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable
a marriage, nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising
from so ill-judged a direction of talents; talents, which,
rightly used, might at least have preserved the respectability of
his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) daughters, even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
wife.

<p/>When Elizabeth had rejoiced over Wickham’s departure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found
little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment.
Their parties abroad were less varied than before, and at home
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the
dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their
domestic circle; and, though Kitty might in time regain her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
natural degree of sense, since the disturbers of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) brain were
removed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) other sister, from whose disposition greater evil
might be apprehended, was likely to be hardened in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) folly
and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a
watering-place and a camp. Upon the whole, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) found,
what has been sometimes found before, that an event to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
had looked forward with impatient desire did not, in taking
place, bring all the satisfaction she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had promised herself. It
was consequently necessary to name some other period for the
commencement of actual felicity—to have some other point on which
her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) wishes and hopes might be fixed, and by again enjoying the
pleasure of anticipation, console herself for the present, and
prepare for another disappointment. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) tour to the Lakes was now
the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) happiest thoughts; it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) best consolation
for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
mother and Kitty made inevitable; and could she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) have included
Jane in the scheme, every part of it would have been perfect.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But it is fortunate,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "that I have something to
wish for. Were the whole arrangement complete, my disappointment
would be certain. But here, by carrying with me one ceaseless
source of regret in my sister’s absence, I may reasonably hope to
have all my expectations of pleasure realised. A scheme of which
every part promises delight can never be successful; and general
disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little
peculiar vexation."

<p/>When Lydia went away she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) promised to write very often and very
minutely to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother and Kitty; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) letters were always
long expected, and always very short. Those to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mother
contained little else than that they were just returned from the
library, where such and such officers had attended them, and
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) quite
wild; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) had a new gown, or a new parasol, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would
have described more fully, but was obliged to leave off in a
violent hurry, as Mrs. Forster called her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>), and they were going
off to the camp; and from her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) correspondence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) sister,
there was still less to be learnt—for her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) letters to Kitty,
though rather longer, were much too full of lines under the words
to be made public.

<p/>After the first fortnight or three weeks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) absence, health,
good humour, and cheerfulness began to reappear at Longbourn.
Everything wore a happier aspect. The families who had been in
town for the winter came back again, and summer finery and summer
engagements arose. Mrs. Bennet was restored to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) usual
querulous serenity; and, by the middle of June, Kitty was so much
recovered as to be able to enter Meryton without tears; an event
of such happy promise as to make Elizabeth hope that by the
following Christmas she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be so tolerably reasonable as not
to mention an officer above once a day, unless, by some cruel and
malicious arrangement at the War Office, another regiment should
be quartered in Meryton.

<p/>The time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now
fast approaching, and a fortnight only was wanting of it, when a
letter arrived from Mrs. Gardiner, which at once delayed its
commencement and curtailed its extent. Mr. Gardiner would be
prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in
July, and must be in London again within a month, and as that
left too short a period for them to go so far, and see so much as
they had proposed, or at least to see it with the leisure and
comfort they had built on, they were obliged to give up the
Lakes, and substitute a more contracted tour, and, according to
the present plan, were to go no farther northwards than
Derbyshire. In that county there was enough to be seen to occupy
the chief of their three weeks; and to Mrs. Gardiner it had a
peculiarly strong attraction. The town where she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had formerly
passed some years of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) life, and where they were now to spend a
few days, was probably as great an object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) curiosity as all
the celebrated beauties of Matlock, Chatsworth, Dovedale, or the
Peak.

<p/>Elizabeth was excessively disappointed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had set her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart on
seeing the Lakes, and still thought there might have been time
enough. But it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) business to be satisfied—and certainly her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
temper to be happy; and all was soon right again.

<p/>With the mention of Derbyshire there were many ideas connected.
It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to see the word without thinking of
Pemberley and its owner. <div class="bookquote">"But surely,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I may enter his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>)
county with impunity, and rob it of a few petrified spars without
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) perceiving me."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The period of expectation was now doubled. Four weeks were to
pass away before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt’s arrival. But they did pass
away, and Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, with their four children, did at
length appear at Longbourn. The children, two girls of six and
eight years old, and two younger boys, were to be left under the
particular care of their cousin Jane, who was the general
favourite, and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly
adapted her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for attending to them in every way—teaching them,
playing with them, and loving them.

<p/>The Gardiners stayed only one night at Longbourn, and set off the
next morning with Elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement.
One enjoyment was certain—that of suitableness of companions; a
suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear
inconveniences—cheerfulness to enhance every pleasure—and
affection and intelligence, which might supply it among
themselves if there were disappointments abroad.

<p/>It is not the object of this work to give a description of
Derbyshire, nor of any of the remarkable places through which
their route thither lay; Oxford, Blenheim, Warwick, Kenilworth,
Birmingham, etc. are sufficiently known. A small part of
Derbyshire is all the present concern. To the little town of
Lambton, the scene of Mrs. Gardiner’s former residence, and where
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had lately learned some acquaintance still remained, they
bent their steps, after having seen all the principal wonders of
the country; and within five miles of Lambton, Elizabeth found
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt that Pemberley was situated. It was not in their
direct road, nor more than a mile or two out of it. In talking
over their route the evening before, Mrs. Gardiner expressed an
inclination to see the place again. Mr. Gardiner declared his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
willingness, and Elizabeth was applied to for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) approbation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My love, should not you like to see a place of which you have
heard so much?"  (<font color='red'><b>aunt place</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt; "a place, too, with which so many
of your acquaintances are connected. Wickham passed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) youth
there, you know."

<p/>Elizabeth was distressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no business at
Pemberley, and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing
it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must own that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was tired of seeing great houses; after
going over so many, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) really had no pleasure in fine carpets or
satin curtains.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner abused her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) stupidity. <div class="bookquote">"If it were merely a fine
house richly furnished,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>), "I should not care about it
myself; but the grounds are delightful. They have some of the
finest woods in the country."

<p/>Elizabeth said no more—but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind could not acquiesce. The
possibility of meeting Mr. Darcy, while viewing the place,
instantly occurred. It would be dreadful! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) blushed at the very
idea, and thought it would be better to speak openly to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt
than to run such a risk. But against this there were objections;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) finally resolved that it could be the last resource, if
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) private enquiries to the absence of the family were
unfavourably answered.

<p/>Accordingly, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) retired at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked the chambermaid
whether Pemberley were not a very fine place? what was the name
of its proprietor? and, with no little alarm, whether the family
were down for the summer? A most welcome negative followed the
last question—and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) alarms now being removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was at
leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house
herself; and when the subject was revived the next morning, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was again applied to, could readily answer, and with a proper
air of indifference, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not really any dislike to the
scheme. To Pemberley, therefore, they were to go.
