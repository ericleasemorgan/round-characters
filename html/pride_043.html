<p/>Elizabeth, as they drove along, watched for the first appearance
of Pemberley Woods with some perturbation; and when at length
they turned in at the lodge, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were in a high flutter.

<p/>The park was very large, and contained great variety of ground.
They entered it in one of its lowest points, and drove for some
time through a beautiful wood stretching over a wide extent.

<p/>Elizabeth’s mind was too full for conversation, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw and
admired every remarkable spot and point of view. They gradually
ascended for half-a-mile, and then found themselves at the top of
a considerable eminence, where the wood ceased, and the eye was
instantly caught by Pemberley House, situated on the opposite
side of a valley, into which the road with some abruptness wound.
It was a large, handsome stone building, standing well on rising
ground, and backed by a ridge of high woody hills; and in front,
a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater, but
without any artificial appearance. Its banks were neither formal
nor falsely adorned. Elizabeth was delighted. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never seen
a place for which nature had done more, or where natural beauty
had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste. They were
all of them warm in their admiration; and at that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt
that to be mistress of Pemberley might be something!

<p/>They descended the hill, crossed the bridge, and drove to the
door; and, while examining the nearer aspect of the house, all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) apprehension of meeting its owner returned. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded lest
the chambermaid had been mistaken. On applying to see the place,
they were admitted into the hall; and Elizabeth, as they waited
for the housekeeper, had leisure to wonder at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was.

<p/>The housekeeper came; a respectable-looking elderly woman, much
less fine, and more civil, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had any notion of finding
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). They followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into the dining-parlour. It was a large,
well proportioned room, handsomely fitted up. Elizabeth, after
slightly surveying it, went to a window to enjoy its prospect.
The hill, crowned with wood, which they had descended, receiving
increased abruptness from the distance, was a beautiful object.
Every disposition of the ground was good; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked on the
whole scene, the river, the trees scattered on its banks and the
winding of the valley, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could trace it, with
delight. As they passed into other rooms these objects were
taking different positions; but from every window there were
beauties to be seen. The rooms were lofty and handsome, and their
furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor; but
Elizabeth saw, with admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>proprietor</b></font>) taste, that it was neither
gaudy nor uselessly fine; with less of splendour, and more real
elegance, than the furniture of Rosings.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And of this place,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I might have been mistress!
With these rooms I might now have been familiarly acquainted!
Instead of viewing them as a stranger, I might have rejoiced in
them as my own, and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and
aunt. But no," (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—recollecting herself—"that could never be; my
uncle and aunt would have been lost to me; I should not have been
allowed to invite them."

<p/>This was a lucky recollection—it saved her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) from something very
like regret.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) master was
really absent, but had not the courage for it. At length however,
the question was asked by her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) uncle; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) turned away with
alarm, while Mrs. Reynolds replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was, adding, <div class="bookquote">"But we
expect him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) to-morrow, with a large party of friends."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>How
rejoiced was Elizabeth that their own journey had not by any
circumstance been delayed a day!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt now called her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to look at a picture. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) approached and
saw the likeness of Mr. Wickham, suspended, amongst several other
miniatures, over the mantelpiece. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), smilingly,
how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liked it. The housekeeper came forward, and told them it
was a picture of a young gentleman, the son of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) late master’s
steward, who had been brought up by him (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) own expense. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>)
is now gone into the army,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) added; <div class="bookquote">"but I am afraid he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) has
turned out very wild."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Gardiner looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece with a smile, but Elizabeth
could not return it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And that,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Reynolds</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Reynolds, pointing to another of the
miniatures, "is my master—and very like him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>). It was drawn at the
same time as the other—about eight years ago."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have heard much of your master’s fine person,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gardiner, looking at the picture; "it is a handsome face. But,
Lizzy, you can tell us whether it is like or not.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Reynolds respect for Elizabeth seemed to increase on this
intimation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) master.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>that lady</b></font>)</div>Does that young lady know Mr. Darcy?"

<p/>Elizabeth coloured, and said: "A little."

<p/>"And do not you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a very handsome gentleman, ma’am?"

<p/>"Yes, very handsome."

<p/>"I am sure _I_ know none so handsome; but in the gallery up
stairs you will see a finer, larger picture of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) than this.
This room was my late master’s favourite room, and these
miniatures are just as they used to be then. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was very fond of
them."

<p/>This accounted to Elizabeth for Mr. Wickham’s being among them.

<p/>Mrs. Reynolds then directed their attention to one of Miss Darcy,
drawn when she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) was only eight years old.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And is Miss Darcy as handsome as her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Gardiner.

<p/>"Oh! yes—the handsomest young lady that ever was seen; and so
accomplished!—She (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) plays and sings all day long. In the next room
is a new instrument just come down for her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)—a present from my
master; she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) comes here to-morrow with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Gardiner, whose manners were very easy and pleasant,
encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) communicativeness by his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) questions and remarks;
Mrs. Reynolds, either by pride or attachment, had evidently great
pleasure in talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) master and his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>master</b></font>)</div>Is your master much at Pemberley in the course of the year?"

<p/>"Not so much as I could wish, sir; but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) may spend
half his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) time here; and Miss Darcy is always down for the summer
months."

<p/>"Except,<div class="bookquote">" thought Elizabeth, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) goes to Ramsgate."

<p/>"If your master would marry, you might see more of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)."

<p/>"Yes, sir; but I do not know when _that_ will be. I do not know
who is good enough for him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)."

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner smiled. Elizabeth could not help saying,
<div class="bookquote">"It is very much to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) credit, I am sure, that you should think
so."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>"I say no more than the truth, and everybody will say that knows
him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)," replied the other. Elizabeth thought this was going pretty
far; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) listened with increasing astonishment as the
housekeeper added, <div class="bookquote">"I have never known a cross word from him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) in
my life, and I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) ever since he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was four years old."

 (<font color='red'><b>the housekeeper</b></font>)</div><p/>This was praise, of all others most extraordinary, most opposite
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ideas. That he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was not a good-tempered man had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
firmest opinion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) keenest attention was awakened; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed
to hear more, and was grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle for saying:

<p/>"There are very few people of whom so much can be said. You are
lucky in having such a master."

<p/>"Yes, sir, I know I am. If I were to go through the world, I
could not meet with a better. But I have always observed, that
they who are good-natured when children, are good-natured when
they grow up; and he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was always the sweetest-tempered, most
generous-hearted boy in the world.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth almost stared at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>Can this be Mr. Darcy?<div class="bookquote">" thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father was an excellent man," said Mrs. Gardiner.

<p/>"Yes, ma’am, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was indeed; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) son will be just like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)—just as affable to the poor."

<p/>Elizabeth listened, wondered, doubted, and was impatient for
more. Mrs. Reynolds could interest her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) on no other point. She (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)
related the subjects of the pictures, the dimensions of the
rooms, and the price of the furniture, in vain. Mr. Gardiner,
highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
attributed her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) excessive commendation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) master, soon led
again to the subject; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) dwelt with energy on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) many
merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) is the best landlord, and the best master,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>), "that
ever lived; not like the wild young men nowadays, who think of
nothing but themselves. There is not one of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) tenants or
servants but will give him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) a good name. Some people call him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)
proud; but I am sure I never saw anything of it. To my fancy, it
is only because he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) does not rattle away like other young men."

<p/>"In what an amiable light does this place him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)!<div class="bookquote">" thought
Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>This fine account of him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)," whispered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt as they walked,
"is not quite consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) behaviour to our poor friend."

<p/>"Perhaps we might be deceived."

<p/>"That is not very likely; our authority was too good.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>On reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very
pretty sitting-room, lately fitted up with greater elegance and
lightness than the apartments below; and were informed that it
was but just done to give pleasure to Miss Darcy, who had taken a
liking to the room when last at Pemberley.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) is certainly a good brother," said Elizabeth, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) walked
towards one of the windows.

<p/>Mrs. Reynolds anticipated Miss Darcy’s delight, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) should
enter the room. <div class="bookquote">"And this is always the way with him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) added.
"Whatever can give his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) sister any pleasure is sure to be done in
a moment. There is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) would not do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>)."

<p/>The picture-gallery, and two or three of the principal bedrooms,
were all that remained to be shown. In the former were many good
paintings; but Elizabeth knew nothing of the art; and from such
as had been already visible below, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had willingly turned to
look at some drawings of Miss Darcy’s, in crayons, whose subjects
were usually more interesting, and also more intelligible.

<p/>In the gallery there were many family portraits, but they could
have little to fix the attention of a stranger. Elizabeth walked
in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).
At last it arrested her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)—and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) beheld a striking resemblance to
Mr. Darcy, with such a smile over the face as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered to
have sometimes seen when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stood several
minutes before the picture, in earnest contemplation, and
returned to it again before they quitted the gallery. Mrs.
Reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) father’s
lifetime.

<p/>There was certainly at this moment, in Elizabeth’s mind, a more
gentle sensation towards the original than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had ever felt at
the height of their acquaintance. The commendation bestowed on
him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) by Mrs. Reynolds was of no trifling nature. What praise is
more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant? As a
brother, a landlord, a master, she (<font color='blue'><b>Reynolds</b></font>) considered how many people’s
happiness were in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) guardianship!—how much of pleasure or pain
was it in his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) power to bestow!—how much of good or evil must be
done by him (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>)! Every idea that had been brought forward by the
housekeeper was favourable to his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) character, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) stood
before the canvas on which he (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) was represented, and fixed his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) eyes
upon herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) regard with a deeper sentiment
of gratitude than it had ever raised before; she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) remembered its
warmth, and softened its impropriety of expression.

<p/>When all of the house that was open to general inspection had
been seen, they returned downstairs, and, taking leave of the
housekeeper, were consigned over to the gardener, who met them at
the hall-door.

<p/>As they walked across the hall towards the river, Elizabeth
turned back to look again; her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt stopped also, and
while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building,
the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road,
which led behind it to the stables.

<p/>They were within twenty yards of each other, and so abrupt was
his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) appearance, that it was impossible to avoid his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) sight. Their
eyes instantly met, and the cheeks of both were overspread with
the deepest blush. He (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) absolutely started, and for a moment seemed
immovable from surprise; but shortly recovering himself, advanced
towards the party, and spoke to Elizabeth, if not in terms of
perfect composure, at least of perfect civility.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had instinctively turned away; but stopping on his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) approach,
received his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be
overcome. Had his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) first appearance, or his (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) resemblance to the
picture they had just been examining, been insufficient to assure
the other two that they now saw Mr. Darcy, the gardener’s
expression of surprise, on beholding his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) master, must immediately
have told it. They stood a little aloof while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was talking to
their niece, who, astonished and confused, scarcely dared lift
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face, and knew not what answer she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) returned to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) civil enquiries after her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) family. Amazed at the alteration of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manner since they last parted, every sentence that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) uttered
was increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) embarrassment; and every idea of the
impropriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) being found there recurring to her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind, the
few minutes in which they continued were some of the most
uncomfortable in her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) life. Nor did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seem much more at ease;
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke, his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) accent had none of its usual sedateness; and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) enquiries as to the time of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) having left
Longbourn, and of her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) stay in Derbyshire, so often, and in so
hurried a way, as plainly spoke the distraction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>At length every idea seemed to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); and, after standing a
few moments without saying a word, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) suddenly recollected
himself, and took leave.

<p/>The others then joined her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and expressed admiration of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
figure; but Elizabeth heard not a word, and wholly engrossed by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own feelings, followed them in silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was overpowered
by shame and vexation. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coming there was the most unfortunate,
the most ill-judged thing in the world! How strange it must
appear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)! In what a disgraceful light might it not strike so
vain a man! It might seem as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had purposely thrown herself
in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way again! Oh! why did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) come? Or, why did he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thus come
a day before he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected? Had they been only ten minutes
sooner, they should have been beyond the reach of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
discrimination; for it was plain that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was that moment
arrived—that moment alighted from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) horse or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carriage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting. And
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) behaviour, so strikingly altered—what could it mean? That he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
should even speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was amazing!—but to speak with such
civility, to enquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family! Never in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) life had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
seen his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners so little dignified, never had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) spoken with
such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting. What a contrast
did it offer to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last address in Rosings Park, when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) put his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
letter into her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hand! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew not what to think, or how to
account for it.

<p/>They had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water,
and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground, or a
finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching; but it
was some time before Elizabeth was sensible of any of it; and,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
uncle and aunt, and seemed to direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes to such objects as
they pointed out, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) distinguished no part of the scene. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of Pemberley House,
whichever it might be, where Mr. Darcy then was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) longed to
know what at the moment was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mind—in what manner he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and whether, in defiance of everything, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
still dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been civil only because he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) felt
himself at ease; yet there had been _that_ in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) voice which was
not like ease. Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had felt more of pain or of pleasure in
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not tell, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) certainly had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
with composure.

<p/>At length, however, the remarks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) absence
of mind aroused her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt the necessity of appearing more
like herself.

<p/>They entered the woods, and bidding adieu to the river for a
while, ascended some of the higher grounds; when, in spots where
the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander, were many
charming views of the valley, the opposite hills, with the long
range of woods overspreading many, and occasionally part of the
stream. Mr. Gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole
park, but feared it might be beyond a walk. With a triumphant
smile they were told that it was ten miles round. It settled the
matter; and they pursued the accustomed circuit; which brought
them again, after some time, in a descent among hanging woods, to
the edge of the water, and one of its narrowest parts. They
crossed it by a simple bridge, in character with the general air
of the scene; it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet
visited; and the valley, here contracted into a glen, allowed
room only for the stream, and a narrow walk amidst the rough
coppice-wood which bordered it. Elizabeth longed to explore its
windings; but when they had crossed the bridge, and perceived
their distance from the house, Mrs. Gardiner, who was not a great
walker, could go no farther, and thought only of returning to the
carriage as quickly as possible. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece was, therefore,
obliged to submit, and they took their way towards the house on
the opposite side of the river, in the nearest direction; but
their progress was slow, for Mr. Gardiner, though seldom able to
indulge the taste, was very fond of fishing, and was so much
engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in
the water, and talking to the man about them, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) advanced
but little. Whilst wandering on in this slow manner, they were
again surprised, and Elizabeth’s astonishment was quite equal to
what it had been at first, by the sight of Mr. Darcy approaching
them, and at no great distance. The walk being here less
sheltered than on the other side, allowed them to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) before
they met. Elizabeth, however astonished, was at least more
prepared for an interview than before, and resolved to appear and
to speak with calmness, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) really intended to meet them. For a
few moments, indeed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would probably strike into
some other path. The idea lasted while a turning in the walk
concealed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from their view; the turning past, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
immediately before them. With a glance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had lost
none of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) recent civility; and, to imitate his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) politeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
began, as they met, to admire the beauty of the place; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had not got beyond the words <div class="bookquote">"delightful,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"charming,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>when
some unlucky recollections obtruded, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fancied that praise
of Pemberley from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might be mischievously construed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
colour changed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said no more.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner was standing a little behind; and on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) pausing,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) if she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would do him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) the honour of introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) friends. This was a stroke of civility for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was
quite unprepared; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) could hardly suppress a smile at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people
against whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride had revolted in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) offer to herself.
<div class="bookquote">"What will be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) surprise,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>), "when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) knows who they
are? He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) takes them now for people of fashion."

<p/>The introduction, however, was immediately made; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) named
their relationship to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) stole a sly look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), to
see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) bore it, and was not without the expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
decamping as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could from such disgraceful companions.
That he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was _surprised_ by the connection was evident; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sustained it, however, with fortitude, and so far from going
away, turned back with them, and entered into conversation with
Mr. Gardiner. Elizabeth could not but be pleased, could not but
triumph. It was consoling that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) should know she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had some
relations for whom there was no need to blush. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) listened most
attentively to all that passed between them, and gloried in every
expression, every sentence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle, which marked his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
intelligence, his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) taste, or his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) good manners.

<p/>The conversation soon turned upon fishing; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heard Mr.
Darcy invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), with the greatest civility, to fish there as
often as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) chose while he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued in the neighbourhood,
offering at the same time to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with fishing tackle, and
pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually
most sport. Mrs. Gardiner, who was walking arm-in-arm with
Elizabeth, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a look expressive of wonder. Elizabeth said
nothing, but it gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) exceedingly; the compliment must be
all for herself. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment, however, was extreme, and
continually was she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) repeating, "Why is he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so altered? From what
can it proceed? It cannot be for _me_—it cannot be for _my_ sake
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) manners are thus softened. My reproofs at Hunsford could
not work such a change as this. It is impossible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) should
still love me."

<p/>After walking some time in this way, the two ladies in front, the
two gentlemen behind, on resuming their places, after descending
to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some
curious water-plant, there chanced to be a little alteration. It
originated in Mrs. Gardiner, who, fatigued by the exercise of the
morning, found Elizabeth’s arm inadequate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) support, and
consequently preferred her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband’s. Mr. Darcy took her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) place by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) niece, and they walked on together. After a short silence,
the lady first spoke. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to know that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had been
assured of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) absence before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) came to the place, and
accordingly began by observing, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival had been very
unexpected—<div class="bookquote">"for your housekeeper,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) added, <div class="bookquote">"informed us that
you would certainly not be here till to-morrow; and indeed,
before we left Bakewell, we understood that you were not
immediately expected in the country."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) acknowledged the truth
of it all, and said that business with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) steward had occasioned
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with
whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been travelling. <div class="bookquote">"They will join me early to-morrow,"
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued, "and among them are some who will claim an
acquaintance with you—Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters."

<p/>Elizabeth answered only by a slight bow. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were
instantly driven back to the time when Mr. Bingley’s name had
been the last mentioned between them; and, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might judge by
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) complexion, _his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_ mind was not very differently engaged.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is also one other person in the party,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) continued after
a pause, "who more particularly wishes to be known to you. Will
you allow me, or do I ask too much, to introduce my sister to
your acquaintance during your stay at Lambton?"

<p/>The surprise of such an application was great indeed; it was too
great for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to know in what manner she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) acceded to it. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
immediately felt that whatever desire Miss Darcy might have of
being acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) must be the work of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother, and,
without looking farther, it was satisfactory; it was gratifying
to know that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) resentment had not made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) think really ill of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).

<p/>They now walked on in silence, each of them deep in thought.
Elizabeth was not comfortable; that was impossible; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
flattered and pleased. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wish of introducing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was a compliment of the highest kind. They soon outstripped the
others, and when they had reached the carriage, Mr. and Mrs.
Gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) then asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to walk into the house—but she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) declared herself
not tired, and they stood together on the lawn. At such a time
much might have been said, and silence was very awkward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
wanted to talk, but there seemed to be an embargo on every
subject. At last she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollected that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been travelling,
and they talked of Matlock and Dove Dale with great perseverance.
Yet time and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) aunt moved slowly—and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) patience and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) ideas
were nearly worn out before the _tête-à-tête_ was over.

<p/>On Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s coming up they were all pressed to go
into the house and take some refreshment; but this was declined,
and they parted on each side with utmost politeness. Mr. Darcy
handed the ladies into the carriage; and when it drove off,
Elizabeth saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) walking slowly towards the house.

<p/>The observations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt now began; and each of
them pronounced him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be infinitely superior to anything they
had expected. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is perfectly well behaved, polite, and
unassuming,"  (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There _is_ something a little stately in him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>), to be sure,"
 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt, "but it is confined to his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) air, and is not
unbecoming. I can now say with the housekeeper, that though some
people may call him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) proud, _I_ have seen nothing of it."

<p/>"I was never more surprised than by his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) behaviour to us. It was
more than civil; it was really attentive; and there was no
necessity for such attention. His (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) acquaintance with Elizabeth was
very trifling."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To be sure, Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) aunt, "he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is not so handsome as
Wickham; or, rather, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has not Wickham’s countenance, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
features are perfectly good. But how came you to tell me that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
was so disagreeable?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth excused herself as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could; said that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had
liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) better when they had met in Kent than before, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) so pleasant as this morning.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) may be a little whimsical in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) civilities,"
replied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle. "Your great men often are; and therefore I
shall not take him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) at his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) word, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) might change his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) mind
another day, and warn me off his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) grounds.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth felt that they had entirely misunderstood his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
character, but said nothing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>From what we have seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)," continued Mrs. Gardiner, "I
really should not have thought that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) could have behaved in so
cruel a way by anybody as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has done by poor Wickham. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has not
an ill-natured look. On the contrary, there is something pleasing
about his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) mouth when he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) speaks. And there is something of dignity
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) heart. But, to be sure, the good lady who showed us his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
house did give him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) a most flaming character! I could hardly help
laughing aloud sometimes. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is a liberal master, I suppose,
and _that_ in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue."

<p/>Elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in
vindication of his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) behaviour to Wickham; and therefore gave them
to understand, in as guarded a manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could, that by what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard from his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) relations in Kent, his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) actions were
capable of a very different construction; and that his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) character
was by no means so faulty, nor Wickham’s so amiable, as they had
been considered in Hertfordshire. In confirmation of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in
which they had been connected, without actually naming her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
authority, but stating it to be such as might be relied on.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner was surprised and concerned; but as they were now
approaching the scene of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former pleasures, every idea gave
way to the charm of recollection; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was too much engaged in
pointing out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) husband all the interesting spots in its
environs to think of anything else. Fatigued as she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been by
the morning’s walk they had no sooner dined than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) set off
again in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former acquaintance, and the evening was
spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many
years’ discontinuance.

<p/>The occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave
Elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could do nothing but think, and think with wonder, of Mr. Darcy’s
civility, and, above all, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be acquainted
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.
