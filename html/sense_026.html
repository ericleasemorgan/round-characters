<p/>Elinor could not find herself in the carriage with Mrs. Jennings, and
beginning a journey to London under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) protection, and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) guest,
without wondering at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own situation, so short had their acquaintance
with that lady been, so wholly unsuited were they in age and
disposition, and so many had been her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) objections against such a measure
only a few days before! But these objections had all, with that happy
ardour of youth which Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother equally shared, been
overcome or overlooked; and Elinor, in spite of every occasional doubt
of Willoughby’s constancy, could not witness the rapture of delightful
expectation which filled the whole soul and beamed in the eyes of
Marianne, without feeling how blank was her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own prospect, how cheerless
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own state of mind in the comparison, and how gladly she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would
engage in the solicitude of Marianne’s situation to have the same
animating object in view, the same possibility of hope. A short, a very
short time however must now decide what Willoughby’s intentions were;
in all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was already in town. Marianne’s eagerness to be
gone declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) dependence on finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) there; and Elinor was
resolved not only upon gaining every new light as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own observation or the intelligence of others could give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),
but likewise upon watching his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister with such
zealous attention, as to ascertain what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was and what he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) meant,
before many meetings had taken place. Should the result of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
observations be unfavourable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was determined at all events to open
the eyes of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister; should it be otherwise, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exertions would be
of a different nature—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then learn to avoid every selfish
comparison, and banish every regret which might lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) satisfaction
in the happiness of Marianne.

<p/>They were three days on their journey, and Marianne’s behaviour as they
travelled was a happy specimen of what future complaisance and
companionableness to Mrs. Jennings might be expected to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sat in
silence almost all the way, wrapt in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own meditations, and scarcely
ever voluntarily speaking, except when any object of picturesque beauty
within their view drew from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) an exclamation of delight exclusively
addressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister. To atone for this conduct therefore, Elinor
took immediate possession of the post of civility which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had
assigned herself, behaved with the greatest attention to Mrs. Jennings,
talked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), laughed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
could; and Mrs. Jennings on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) side treated them both with all
possible kindness, was solicitous on every occasion for their ease and
enjoyment, and only disturbed that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not make them choose their
own dinners at the inn, nor extort a confession of their preferring
salmon to cod, or boiled fowls to veal cutlets. They reached town by
three o’clock the third day, glad to be released, after such a journey,
from the confinement of a carriage, and ready to enjoy all the luxury
of a good fire.

<p/>The house was handsome, and handsomely fitted up, and the young ladies
were immediately put in possession of a very comfortable apartment. It
had formerly been Charlotte’s, and over the mantelpiece still hung a
landscape in coloured silks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) performance, in proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) having
spent seven years at a great school in town to some effect.

<p/>As dinner was not to be ready in less than two hours from their
arrival, Elinor determined to employ the interval in writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother, and sat down for that purpose. In a few moments Marianne did
the same. <div class="bookquote">"_I_ am writing home, Marianne,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; <div class="bookquote">"had not you
better defer your letter for a day or two?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I am _not_ going to write to my mother,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>replied Marianne, hastily,
and as if wishing to avoid any farther inquiry. Elinor said no more; it
immediately struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) must then be writing to Willoughby; and
the conclusion which as instantly followed was, that, however
mysteriously they might wish to conduct the affair, they must be
engaged. This conviction, though not entirely satisfactory, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
pleasure, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) letter with greater alacrity.
Marianne’s was finished in a very few minutes; in length it could be no
more than a note; it was then folded up, sealed, and directed with
eager rapidity. Elinor thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could distinguish a large W in the
direction; and no sooner was it complete than Marianne, ringing the
bell, requested the footman who answered it to get that letter conveyed
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the two-penny post. This decided the matter at once.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spirits still continued very high; but there was a flutter in them
which prevented their giving much pleasure to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, and this
agitation increased as the evening drew on. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could scarcely eat any
dinner, and when they afterwards returned to the drawing room, seemed
anxiously listening to the sound of every carriage.

<p/>It was a great satisfaction to Elinor that Mrs. Jennings, by being much
engaged in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own room, could see little of what was passing. The tea
things were brought in, and already had Marianne been disappointed more
than once by a rap at a neighbouring door, when a loud one was suddenly
heard which could not be mistaken for one at any other house, Elinor
felt secure of its announcing Willoughby’s approach, and Marianne,
starting up, moved towards the door. Every thing was silent; this could
not be borne many seconds; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opened the door, advanced a few steps
towards the stairs, and after listening half a minute, returned into
the room in all the agitation which a conviction of having heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
would naturally produce; in the ecstasy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings at that instant
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help exclaiming, <div class="bookquote">"Oh, Elinor, it is Willoughby, indeed it
is!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and seemed almost ready to throw herself into his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) arms, when
Colonel Brandon appeared.

<p/>It was too great a shock to be borne with calmness, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) immediately
left the room. Elinor was disappointed too; but at the same time her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
regard for Colonel Brandon ensured his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) welcome with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
particularly hurt that a man so partial to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister should perceive
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) experienced nothing but grief and disappointment in seeing
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantly saw that it was not unnoticed by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) even
observed Marianne as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) quitted the room, with such astonishment and
concern, as hardly left him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) the recollection of what civility demanded
towards herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is your sister ill?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor answered in some distress that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was, and then talked of
head-aches, low spirits, and over fatigues; and of every thing to which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could decently attribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s behaviour.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with the most earnest attention, but seeming to recollect
himself, said no more on the subject, and began directly to speak of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pleasure at seeing them in London, making the usual inquiries about
their journey, and the friends they had left behind.

<p/>In this calm kind of way, with very little interest on either side,
they continued to talk, both of them out of spirits, and the thoughts
of both engaged elsewhere. Elinor wished very much to ask whether
Willoughby were then in town, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was afraid of giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) pain by
any enquiry after his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) rival; and at length, by way of saying something,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) asked if he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had been in London ever since she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) last.
<div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) replied, with some embarrassment, "almost ever since; I have
been once or twice at Delaford for a few days, but it has never been in
my power to return to Barton."

<p/>This, and the manner in which it was said, immediately brought back to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) remembrance all the circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) quitting that place, with
the uneasiness and suspicions they had caused to Mrs. Jennings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
was fearful that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) question had implied much more curiosity on the
subject than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had ever felt.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings soon came in. <div class="bookquote">"Oh! Colonel,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) usual
noisy cheerfulness, "I am monstrous glad to see you—sorry I could not
come before—beg your pardon, but I have been forced to look about me a
little, and settle my matters; for it is a long while since I have been
at home, and you know one has always a world of little odd things to do
after one has been away for any time; and then I have had Cartwright to
settle with. Lord, I have been as busy as a bee ever since dinner! But
pray, Colonel, how came you to conjure out that I should be in town
today?"

<p/>"I had the pleasure of hearing it at Mr. Palmer’s, where I have been
dining."

<p/>"Oh, you did; well, and how do they all do at their house? How does
Charlotte do? I warrant you she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) is a fine size by this time."

<p/>"Mrs. Palmer appeared quite well, and I am commissioned to tell you,
that you will certainly see her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to-morrow."

<p/>"Ay, to be sure, I thought as much. Well, Colonel, I have brought two
young ladies with me, you see—that is, you see but one of them now, but
there is another somewhere. Your friend, Miss Marianne, too—which you
will not be sorry to hear. I do not know what you and Mr. Willoughby
will do between you about her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Ay, it is a fine thing to be young and
handsome. Well! I was young once, but I never was very handsome—worse
luck for me. However, I got a very good husband, and I don’t know what
the greatest beauty can do more. Ah! poor man! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been dead these
eight years and better. But Colonel, where have you been to since we
parted? And how does your business go on? Come, come, let’s have no
secrets among friends."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) replied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) accustomary mildness to all her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) inquiries, but
without satisfying her (<font color='blue'><b>we</b></font>) in any. Elinor now began to make the tea, and
Marianne was obliged to appear again.

<p/>After her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) entrance, Colonel Brandon became more thoughtful and silent
than he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had been before, and Mrs. Jennings could not prevail on him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) to
stay long. No other visitor appeared that evening, and the ladies were
unanimous in agreeing to go early to bed.

<p/>Marianne rose the next morning with recovered spirits and happy looks.
The disappointment of the evening before seemed forgotten in the
expectation of what was to happen that day. They had not long finished
their breakfast before Mrs. Palmer’s barouche stopped at the door, and
in a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) came laughing into the room: so delighted to see
them all, that it was hard to say whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) received most pleasure
from meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother or the Miss Dashwoods again. So surprised at
their coming to town, though it was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had rather expected all
along; so angry at their accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) mother’s invitation after having
declined her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) own, though at the same time she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) would never have forgiven
them if they had not come!

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr. Palmer will be so happy to see you,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>); "What do you think
he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) said when he (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) heard of your coming with Mama? I forget what it was
now, but it was something so droll!"

<p/>After an hour or two spent in what her (<font color='blue'><b>Mama</b></font>) mother called comfortable chat,
or in other words, in every variety of inquiry concerning all their
acquaintance on Mrs. Jennings’s side, and in laughter without cause on
Mrs. Palmer’s, it was proposed by the latter that they should all
accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) to some shops where she (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>) had business that morning, to
which Mrs. Jennings and Elinor readily consented, as having likewise
some purchases to make themselves; and Marianne, though declining it at
first was induced to go likewise.

<p/>Wherever they went, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was evidently always on the watch. In Bond
Street especially, where much of their business lay, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes were in
constant inquiry; and in whatever shop the party were engaged, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind
was equally abstracted from every thing actually before them, from all
that interested and occupied the others. Restless and dissatisfied
every where, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister could never obtain her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) opinion of any article
of purchase, however it might equally concern them both: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) received
no pleasure from anything; was only impatient to be at home again, and
could with difficulty govern her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) vexation at the tediousness of Mrs.
Palmer, whose eye was caught by every thing pretty, expensive, or new;
who was wild to buy all, could determine on none, and dawdled away her (<font color='blue'><b>Palmer</b></font>)
time in rapture and indecision.

<p/>It was late in the morning before they returned home; and no sooner had
they entered the house than Marianne flew eagerly up stairs, and when
Elinor followed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) turning from the table with a sorrowful
countenance, which declared that no Willoughby had been there.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Has no letter been left here for me since we went out?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
the footman who then entered with the parcels. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was answered in the
negative. <div class="bookquote">"Are you quite sure of it?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) replied. <div class="bookquote">"Are you certain
that no servant, no porter has left any letter or note?"

 (<font color='red'><b>The man</b></font>)</div><p/>The man replied that none had.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How very odd!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), in a low and disappointed voice, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
turned away to the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How odd, indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Elinor within herself, regarding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister
with uneasiness. "If she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had not known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to be in town she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would not
have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) did; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have written to Combe Magna;
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) is in town, how odd that he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) should neither come nor write!
Oh! my dear mother, you must be wrong in permitting an engagement
between a daughter so young, a man so little known, to be carried on in
so doubtful, so mysterious a manner! _I_ long to inquire; and how will
_my_ interference be borne."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) determined, after some consideration, that if appearances continued
many days longer as unpleasant as they now were, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would represent in
the strongest manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother the necessity of some serious
enquiry into the affair.

<p/>Mrs. Palmer and two elderly ladies of Mrs. Jennings’s intimate
acquaintance, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) had met and invited in the morning, dined with
them. The former left them soon after tea to fulfill her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) evening
engagements; and Elinor was obliged to assist in making a whist table
for the others. Marianne was of no use on these occasions, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would
never learn the game; but though her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) time was therefore at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
disposal, the evening was by no means more productive of pleasure to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than to Elinor, for it was spent in all the anxiety of expectation
and the pain of disappointment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sometimes endeavoured for a few
minutes to read; but the book was soon thrown aside, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) returned
to the more interesting employment of walking backwards and forwards
across the room, pausing for a moment whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) came to the window,
in hopes of distinguishing the long-expected rap.
