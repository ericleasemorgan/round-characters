<p/>Sir Walter, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two daughters, and Mrs Clay, were the earliest of all
their party at the rooms in the evening; and as Lady Dalrymple must be
waited for, they took their station by one of the fires in the Octagon
Room.  But hardly were they so settled, when the door opened again, and
Captain Wentworth walked in alone.  Anne was the nearest to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and
making yet a little advance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) instantly spoke.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was preparing
only to bow and pass on, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gentle <div class="bookquote">"How do you do?"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
out of the straight line to stand near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and make enquiries in
return, in spite of the formidable father and sister in the back
ground.  Their being in the back ground was a support to Anne; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew
nothing of their looks, and felt equal to everything which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed
right to be done.

<p/>While they were speaking, a whispering between her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and Elizabeth
caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ear.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not distinguish, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must guess the
subject; and on Captain Wentworth's making a distant bow, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
comprehended that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father had judged so well as to give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that
simple acknowledgement of acquaintance, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was just in time by a
side glance to see a slight curtsey from Elizabeth herself.  This,
though late, and reluctant, and ungracious, was yet better than
nothing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits improved.

<p/>After talking, however, of the weather, and Bath, and the concert,
their conversation began to flag, and so little was said at last, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was expecting him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to go every moment, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) did not; he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seemed in
no hurry to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and presently with renewed spirit, with a little
smile, a little glow, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said--

<p/>"I have hardly seen you since our day at Lyme.  I am afraid you must
have suffered from the shock, and the more from its not overpowering
you at the time.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>It was a frightful hour," said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), "a frightful day!" and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) passed
his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand across his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) eyes, as if the remembrance were still too painful,
but in a moment, half smiling again, added, "The day has produced some
effects however; has had some consequences which must be considered as
the very reverse of frightful.  When you had the presence of mind to
suggest that Benwick would be the properest person to fetch a surgeon,
you could have little idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) being eventually one of those most
concerned in her (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) recovery."

<p/>"Certainly I could have none.  But it appears--I should hope it would
be a very happy match.  There are on both sides good principles and
good temper."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), looking not exactly forward; "but there, I think, ends
the resemblance.  With all my soul I wish them happy, and rejoice over
every circumstance in favour of it.  They have no difficulties to
contend with at home, no opposition, no caprice, no delays.  The
Musgroves are behaving like themselves, most honourably and kindly,
only anxious with true parental hearts to promote their daughter's
comfort.  All this is much, very much in favour of their happiness;
more than perhaps--"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) stopped.  A sudden recollection seemed to occur, and to give him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
some taste of that emotion which was reddening Anne's cheeks and fixing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes on the ground.  After clearing his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) throat, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
proceeded thus--

<p/>"I confess that I do think there is a disparity, too great a disparity,
and in a point no less essential than mind.  I regard Louisa Musgrove
as a very amiable, sweet-tempered girl, and not deficient in
understanding, but Benwick is something more.  He (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) is a clever man, a
reading man; and I confess, that I do consider his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) attaching himself to
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) with some surprise.  Had it been the effect of gratitude, had he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>)
learnt to love her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), because he (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) believed her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) to be preferring him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>), it
would have been another thing.  But I have no reason to suppose it so.
It seems, on the contrary, to have been a perfectly spontaneous,
untaught feeling on his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) side, and this surprises me.  A man like him (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>),
in his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) situation! with a heart pierced, wounded, almost broken!  Fanny
Harville was a very superior creature, and his (<font color='blue'><b>surgeon</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
indeed attachment.  A man does not recover from such a devotion of the
heart to such a woman.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought not; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) does not."

<p/>Either from the consciousness, however, that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend had recovered,
or from other consciousness, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) went no farther; and Anne who, in spite
of the agitated voice in which the latter part had been uttered, and in
spite of all the various noises of the room, the almost ceaseless slam
of the door, and ceaseless buzz of persons walking through, had
distinguished every word, was struck, gratified, confused, and
beginning to breathe very quick, and feel an hundred things in a
moment.  It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to enter on such a subject; and yet,
after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the
smallest wish for a total change, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) only deviated so far as to say--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You were a good while at Lyme, I think?"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"About a fortnight.  I could not leave it till Louisa's doing well was
quite ascertained.  I had been too deeply concerned in the mischief to
be soon at peace.  It had been my doing, solely mine.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would not
have been obstinate if I had not been weak.  The country round Lyme is
very fine.  I walked and rode a great deal; and the more I saw, the
more I found to admire."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should very much like to see Lyme again,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne.

<p/>"Indeed!  I should not have supposed that you could have found anything
in Lyme to inspire such a feeling.  The horror and distress you were
involved in, the stretch of mind, the wear of spirits!  I should have
thought your last impressions of Lyme must have been strong disgust."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The last hours were certainly very painful,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>replied Anne; "but when
pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.  One does
not love a place the less for having suffered in it, unless it has been
all suffering, nothing but suffering, which was by no means the case at
Lyme.  We were only in anxiety and distress during the last two hours,
and previously there had been a great deal of enjoyment.  So much
novelty and beauty! I have travelled so little, that every fresh place
would be interesting to me; but there is real beauty at Lyme; and in
short" (with a faint blush at some recollections), "altogether my
impressions of the place are very agreeable.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) ceased, the entrance door opened again, and the very party
appeared for whom they were waiting.  " (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>Lady Dalrymple, Lady Dalrymple,"
was the rejoicing sound; and with all the eagerness compatible with
anxious elegance, Sir Walter and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) two ladies stepped forward to meet
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>).  Lady Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, escorted by Mr Elliot and
Colonel Wallis, who had happened to arrive nearly at the same instant,
advanced into the room.  The others joined them, and it was a group in
which Anne found herself also necessarily included.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was divided
from Captain Wentworth.  Their interesting, almost too interesting
conversation must be broken up for a time, but slight was the penance
compared with the happiness which brought it on!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had learnt, in
the last ten minutes, more of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings towards Louisa, more of all
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings than she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) dared to think of; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) gave herself up to the
demands of the party, to the needful civilities of the moment, with
exquisite, though agitated sensations.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was in good humour with
all.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had received ideas which disposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) to be courteous and
kind to all, and to pity every one, as being less happy than herself.

<p/>The delightful emotions were a little subdued, when on stepping back
from the group, to be joined again by Captain Wentworth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) saw that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was just in time to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turn into the Concert
Room.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had disappeared, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) felt a moment's regret.
But "they should meet again.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would look for her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would find her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
out before the evening were over, and at present, perhaps, it was as
well to be asunder.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) was in need of a little interval for
recollection."

<p/>Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was
collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed
into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power,
draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people
as they could.

<p/>Very, very happy were both Elizabeth and Anne Elliot as they walked in.
Elizabeth arm in arm with Miss Carteret, and looking on the broad back
of the dowager Viscountess Dalrymple before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), had nothing to wish
for which did not seem within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reach; and Anne--but it would be an
insult to the nature of Anne's felicity, to draw any comparison between
it and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister's; the origin of one all selfish vanity, of the other
all generous attachment.

<p/>Anne saw nothing, thought nothing of the brilliancy of the room.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
happiness was from within.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes were bright and her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) cheeks glowed;
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew nothing about it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was thinking only of the last half
hour, and as they passed to their seats, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind took a hasty range
over it.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) choice of subjects, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) expressions, and still more his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
manner and look, had been such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could see in only one light.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
opinion of Louisa Musgrove's inferiority, an opinion which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
seemed solicitous to give, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wonder at Captain Benwick, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) feelings
as to a first, strong attachment; sentences begun which he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not
finish, his (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) half averted eyes and more than half expressive glance,
all, all declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a heart returning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) at least; that
anger, resentment, avoidance, were no more; and that they were
succeeded, not merely by friendship and regard, but by the tenderness
of the past.  Yes, some share of the tenderness of the past.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could
not contemplate the change as implying less.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must love her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>).

<p/>These were thoughts, with their attendant visions, which occupied and
flurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) too much to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) any power of observation; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
passed along the room without having a glimpse of him (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), without even
trying to discern him (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  When their places were determined on, and they
were all properly arranged, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) looked round to see if he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should happen
to be in the same part of the room, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not; her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) eye could not
reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); and the concert being just opening, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) must consent for a
time to be happy in a humbler way.

<p/>The party was divided and disposed of on two contiguous benches: Anne
was among those on the foremost, and Mr Elliot had manoeuvred so well,
with the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend Colonel Wallis, as to have a seat by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Miss Elliot, surrounded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousins, and the principal object
of Colonel Wallis's gallantry, was quite contented.

<p/>Anne's mind was in a most favourable state for the entertainment of the
evening; it was just occupation enough:  she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had feelings for the
tender, spirits for the gay, attention for the scientific, and patience
for the wearisome; and had never liked a concert better, at least
during the first act.  Towards the close of it, in the interval
succeeding an Italian song, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) explained the words of the song to Mr
Elliot.  They had a concert bill between them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), "is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the
words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love-song must not be
talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not
pretend to understand the language.  I am a very poor Italian scholar."

<p/>"Yes, yes, I see you are.  I see you know nothing of the matter.  You
have only knowledge enough of the language to translate at sight these
inverted, transposed, curtailed Italian lines, into clear,
comprehensible, elegant English.  You need not say anything more of
your ignorance.  Here is complete proof."

<p/>"I will not oppose such kind politeness; but I should be sorry to be
examined by a real proficient."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have not had the pleasure of visiting in Camden Place so long,"
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>replied he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), "without knowing something of Miss Anne Elliot; and I do
regard her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as one who is too modest for the world in general to be
aware of half her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) accomplishments, and too highly accomplished for
modesty to be natural in any other woman."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For shame! for shame! this is too much flattery.  I forget what we are
to have next,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>turning to the bill.

<p/>"Perhaps," said Mr Elliot, speaking low, "I have had a longer
acquaintance with your character than you are aware of."

<p/>"Indeed!  How so?  You can have been acquainted with it only since I
came to Bath, excepting as you might hear me previously spoken of in my
own family."

<p/>"I knew you by report long before you came to Bath.  I had heard you
described by those who knew you intimately.  I have been acquainted
with you by character many years.  Your person, your disposition,
accomplishments, manner; they were all present to me."

<p/>Mr Elliot was not disappointed in the interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hoped to raise.  No
one can withstand the charm of such a mystery.  To have been described
long ago to a recent acquaintance, by nameless people, is irresistible;
and Anne was all curiosity.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wondered, and questioned him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) eagerly;
but in vain.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) delighted in being asked, but he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would not tell.

<p/>"No, no, some time or other, perhaps, but not now.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would mention no
names now; but such, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), had been the fact.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had
many years ago received such a description of Miss Anne Elliot as had
inspired him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) with the highest idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) merit, and excited the
warmest curiosity to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)."

<p/>Anne could think of no one so likely to have spoken with partiality of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) many years ago as the Mr Wentworth of Monkford, Captain Wentworth's
brother.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might have been in Mr Elliot's company, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had not
courage to ask the question.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The name of Anne Elliot,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), "has long had an interesting sound
to me.  Very long has it possessed a charm over my fancy; and, if I
dared, I would breathe my wishes that the name might never change."

<p/>Such, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) believed, were his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) words; but scarcely had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) received their
sound, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attention was caught by other sounds immediately behind
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), which rendered every thing else trivial.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) father and Lady
Dalrymple were speaking.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A well-looking man,"  (<font color='red'><b>Walter</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter, "a very well-looking man."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A very fine young man indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Dalrymple</b></font>)</div>said Lady Dalrymple.  "More air than
one often sees in Bath.  Irish, I dare say."

<p/>"No, I just know his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) name.  A bowing acquaintance.  Wentworth; Captain
Wentworth of the navy.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister married my tenant in Somersetshire,
the Croft, who rents Kellynch."

<p/>Before Sir Walter had reached this point, Anne's eyes had caught the
right direction, and distinguished Captain Wentworth standing among a
cluster of men at a little distance.  As her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eyes fell on him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
seemed to be withdrawn from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  It had that appearance.  It seemed as
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been one moment too late; and as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) dared observe,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not look again:  but the performance was recommencing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
was forced to seem to restore her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attention to the orchestra and look
straight forward.

<p/>When she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could give another glance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had moved away.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not
have come nearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was so surrounded and shut in:
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would rather have caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eye.

<p/>Mr Elliot's speech, too, distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no longer any
inclination to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) not so near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The first act was over.  Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped for some beneficial change; and,
after a period of nothing-saying amongst the party, some of them did
decide on going in quest of tea.  Anne was one of the few who did not
choose to move.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) remained in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) seat, and so did Lady Russell; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the pleasure of getting rid of Mr Elliot; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not mean,
whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might feel on Lady Russell's account, to shrink from
conversation with Captain Wentworth, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the opportunity.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was persuaded by Lady Russell's countenance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did not come however.  Anne sometimes fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) discerned him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) at a
distance, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) never came.  The anxious interval wore away
unproductively.  The others returned, the room filled again, benches
were reclaimed and repossessed, and another hour of pleasure or of
penance was to be sat out, another hour of music was to give delight or
the gapes, as real or affected taste for it prevailed.  To Anne, it
chiefly wore the prospect of an hour of agitation.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not quit
that room in peace without seeing Captain Wentworth once more, without
the interchange of one friendly look.

<p/>In re-settling themselves there were now many changes, the result of
which was favourable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Colonel Wallis declined sitting down
again, and Mr Elliot was invited by Elizabeth and Miss Carteret, in a
manner not to be refused, to sit between them; and by some other
removals, and a little scheming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Carteret</b></font>) own,  Anne was enabled to place
herself much nearer the end of the bench than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been before, much
more within reach of a passer-by.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not do so, without
comparing herself with Miss Larolles, the inimitable Miss Larolles; but
still she (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) did it, and not with much happier effect; though by what
seemed prosperity in the shape of an early abdication in her (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) next
neighbours, she (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) found herself at the very end of the bench before the
concert closed.

<p/>Such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) situation, with a vacant space at hand, when Captain
Wentworth was again in sight.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) not far off.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>)
too; yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) looked grave, and seemed irresolute, and only by very slow
degrees came at last near enough to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) felt that
something must be the matter.  The change was indubitable.  The
difference between his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) present air and what it had been in the Octagon
Room was strikingly great.  Why was it?  She (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Larolles</b></font>) father, of
Lady Russell.  Could there have been any unpleasant glances?  He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) began
by speaking of the concert gravely, more like the Captain Wentworth of
Uppercross; owned himself disappointed, had expected singing; and in
short, must confess that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not be sorry when it was over.  Anne
replied, and spoke in defence of the performance so well, and yet in
allowance for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) feelings so pleasantly, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) countenance
improved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) replied again with almost a smile.  They talked for a
few minutes more; the improvement held; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) even looked down towards the
bench, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) saw a place on it well worth occupying; when at that
moment a touch on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) shoulder obliged Anne to turn round.  It came
from Mr Elliot.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pardon, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must be applied to, to
explain Italian again.  Miss Carteret was very anxious to have a
general idea of what was next to be sung.  Anne could not refuse; but
never had she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sacrificed to politeness with a more suffering spirit.

<p/>A few minutes, though as few as possible, were inevitably consumed; and
when her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own mistress again, when able to turn and look as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had done
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found herself accosted by Captain Wentworth, in a reserved
yet hurried sort of farewell.  <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) must wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) good night; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was
going; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should get home as fast as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Is not this song worth staying for?"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne Elliot/Anne Elliot</b></font>)</div>said Anne, suddenly struck by an
idea which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) yet more anxious to be encouraging.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) replied impressively, "there is nothing worth my staying for;"
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was gone directly.

<p/>Jealousy of Mr Elliot!  It was the only intelligible motive.  Captain
Wentworth jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) affection!  Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) have believed it a week
ago; three hours ago!  For a moment the gratification was exquisite.
But, alas! there were very different thoughts to succeed.  How was such
jealousy to be quieted?  How was the truth to reach him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)?  How, in all
the peculiar disadvantages of their respective situations, would he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ever learn of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) real sentiments?  It was misery to think of Mr
Elliot's attentions.  Their evil was incalculable.
