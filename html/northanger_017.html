<p/>Catherine’s expectations of pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) visit in Milsom Street
were so very high that disappointment was inevitable; and accordingly,
though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was most politely received by General Tilney, and kindly
welcomed by his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter, though Henry was at home, and no one else of
the party, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) return, without spending many hours in the
examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feelings, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) appointment
preparing for happiness which it had not afforded. Instead of finding
herself improved in acquaintance with Miss Tilney, from the intercourse
of the day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) seemed hardly so intimate with her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) as before; instead
of seeing Henry Tilney to greater advantage than ever, in the ease of a
family party, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never said so little, nor been so little
agreeable; and, in spite of their father’s great civilities to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)—in
spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thanks, invitations, and compliments—it had been a release
to get away from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). It puzzled her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to account for all this. It could
not be General Tilney’s fault. That he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was perfectly agreeable and
good-natured, and altogether a very charming man, did not admit of a
doubt, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was tall and handsome, and Henry’s father. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)_ could not
be accountable for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) children’s want of spirits, or for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) want of
enjoyment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) company. The former she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hoped at last might have been
accidental, and the latter she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could only attribute to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own
stupidity. Isabella, on hearing the particulars of the visit, gave a
different explanation: "It was all pride, pride, insufferable
haughtiness and pride! She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had long suspected the family to be very
high, and this made it certain. Such insolence of behaviour as Miss
Tilney’s she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had never heard of in her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) life! Not to do the honours of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) house with common good breeding! To behave to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) guest with such
superciliousness! Hardly even to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)!"

<p/>"But it was not so bad as that, Isabella; there was no
superciliousness; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was very civil."

<p/>"Oh! Don’t defend her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)! And then the brother, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), who had appeared so
attached to you! Good heavens! Well, some people’s feelings are
incomprehensible. And so he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hardly looked once at you the whole day?"

<p/>"I do not say so; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not seem in good spirits."

<p/>"How contemptible! Of all things in the world inconstancy is my
aversion. Let me entreat you never to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) again, my dear
Catherine; indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is unworthy of you."

<p/>"Unworthy! I do not suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever thinks of me."

<p/>"That is exactly what I say; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) never thinks of you. Such fickleness!
Oh! How different to your brother and to mine! I really believe John
has the most constant heart."

<p/>"But as for General Tilney, I assure you it would be impossible for
anybody to behave to me with greater civility and attention; it seemed
to be his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) only care to entertain and make me happy."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! I know no harm of him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>); I do not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) of pride. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>)
is a very gentleman-like man. John thinks very well of him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), and John’s
judgment—"

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"Well, I shall see how they behave to me this evening; we shall meet
them at the rooms."

<p/>"And must I go?"

<p/>"Do not you intend it? I thought it was all settled."

<p/>"Nay, since you make such a point of it, I can refuse you nothing. But
do not insist upon my being very agreeable, for my heart, you know,
will be some forty miles off. And as for dancing, do not mention it, I
beg; _that_ is quite out of the question. Charles Hodges will plague me
to death, I dare say; but I shall cut him (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) very short. Ten to one but he (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>)
guesses the reason, and that is exactly what I want to avoid, so I
shall insist on his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) conjecture to himself."

<p/>Isabella’s opinion of the Tilneys did not influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was
sure there had been no insolence in the manners either of brother or
sister; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) did not credit there being any pride in their hearts.
The evening rewarded her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) confidence; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was met by one with the same
kindness, and by the other with the same attention, as heretofore: Miss
Tilney took pains to be near her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), and Henry asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to dance.

<p/>Having heard the day before in Milsom Street that their elder brother,
Captain Tilney, was expected almost every hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was at no loss for
the name of a very fashionable-looking, handsome young man, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
had never seen before, and who now evidently belonged to their party.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with great admiration, and even supposed it possible
that some people might think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) handsomer than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brother, though, in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) air was more assuming, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) countenance less
prepossessing. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) taste and manners were beyond a doubt decidedly
inferior; for, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) hearing, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) not only protested against every
thought of dancing himself, but even laughed openly at Henry for
finding it possible. From the latter circumstance it may be presumed
that, whatever might be our heroine’s opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) admiration of
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) was not of a very dangerous kind; not likely to produce animosities
between the brothers, nor persecutions to the lady. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)_ cannot be the
instigator of the three villains in horsemen’s greatcoats, by whom she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
will hereafter be forced into a traveling-chaise and four, which will
drive off with incredible speed. Catherine, meanwhile, undisturbed by
presentiments of such an evil, or of any evil at all, except that of
having but a short set to dance down, enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) usual happiness with
Henry Tilney, listening with sparkling eyes to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) said; and,
in finding him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) irresistible, becoming so herself.

<p/>At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again,
and, much to Catherine’s dissatisfaction, pulled his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) brother away. They
retired whispering together; and, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) delicate sensibility did
not take immediate alarm, and lay it down as fact, that Captain Tilney
must have heard some malevolent misrepresentation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) now
hastened to communicate to his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) brother, in the hope of separating them
forever, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could not have her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) partner conveyed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sight without
very uneasy sensations. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) suspense was of full five minutes’
duration; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was beginning to think it a very long quarter of an
hour, when they both returned, and an explanation was given, by Henry’s
requesting to know if she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) friend, Miss Thorpe, would have
any objection to dancing, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) brother would be most happy to be
introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>). Catherine, without hesitation, replied that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
very sure Miss Thorpe did not mean to dance at all. The cruel reply was
passed on to the other, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) immediately walked away.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your brother will not mind it, I know,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), "because I heard him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
say before that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hated dancing; but it was very good-natured in him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to think of it. I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) saw Isabella sitting down, and fancied she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
might wish for a partner; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is quite mistaken, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) would not
dance upon any account in the world."

<p/>Henry smiled, and said, "How very little trouble it can give you to
understand the motive of other people’s actions."

<p/>"Why? What do you mean?"

<p/>"With you, it is not, How is such a one likely to be influenced, What
is the inducement most likely to act upon such a person’s feelings,
age, situation, and probable habits of life considered—but, How should
_I_ be influenced, What would be _my_ inducement in acting so and so?"

<p/>"I do not understand you."

<p/>"Then we are on very unequal terms, for I understand you perfectly
well."

<p/>"Me? Yes; I cannot speak well enough to be unintelligible."

<p/>"Bravo! An excellent satire on modern language."

<p/>"But pray tell me what you mean."

<p/>"Shall I indeed? Do you really desire it? But you are not aware of the
consequences; it will involve you in a very cruel embarrassment, and
certainly bring on a disagreement between us."

<p/>"No, no; it shall not do either; I am not afraid."

<p/>"Well, then, I only meant that your attributing my brother’s wish of
dancing with Miss Thorpe to good nature alone convinced me of your
being superior in good nature yourself to all the rest of the world."

<p/>Catherine blushed and disclaimed, and the gentleman’s predictions were
verified. There was a something, however, in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) words which repaid her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
for the pain of confusion; and that something occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mind so much
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) drew back for some time, forgetting to speak or to listen, and
almost forgetting where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was; till, roused by the voice of Isabella,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) looked up and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) with Captain Tilney preparing to give them
hands across.

<p/>Isabella shrugged her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) shoulders and smiled, the only explanation of
this extraordinary change which could at that time be given; but as it
was not quite enough for Catherine’s comprehension, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
astonishment in very plain terms to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) partner.

<p/>"I cannot think how it could happen! Isabella was so determined not to
dance."

<p/>"And did Isabella never change her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) mind before?"

<p/>"Oh! But, because—And your brother! After what you told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from me,
how could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) think of going to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)?"

<p/>"I cannot take surprise to myself on that head. You bid me be surprised
on your friend’s account, and therefore I am; but as for my brother,
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) conduct in the business, I must own, has been no more than I
believed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) perfectly equal to. The fairness of your friend was an
open attraction; her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) firmness, you know, could only be understood by
yourself."

<p/>"You are laughing; but, I assure you, Isabella is very firm in
general."

<p/>"It is as much as should be said of anyone. To be always firm must be
to be often obstinate. When properly to relax is the trial of judgment;
and, without reference to my brother, I really think Miss Thorpe has by
no means chosen ill in fixing on the present hour."

<p/>The friends were not able to get together for any confidential
discourse till all the dancing was over; but then, as they walked about
the room arm in arm, Isabella thus explained herself: "I do not wonder
at your surprise; and I am really fatigued to death. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is such a
rattle! Amusing enough, if my mind had been disengaged; but I would
have given the world to sit still."

<p/>"Then why did not you?"

<p/>"Oh! My dear! It would have looked so particular; and you know how I
abhor doing that. I refused him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as long as I possibly could, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would take no denial. You have no idea how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pressed me. I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
to excuse me, and get some other partner—but no, not he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); after aspiring
to my hand, there was nobody else in the room he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could bear to think
of; and it was not that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted merely to dance, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wanted to be with
me. Oh! Such nonsense! I told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had taken a very unlikely way to
prevail upon me; for, of all things in the world, I hated fine speeches
and compliments; and so—and so then I found there would be no peace if
I did not stand up. Besides, I thought Mrs. Hughes, who introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>),
might take it ill if I did not: and your dear brother, I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
would have been miserable if I had sat down the whole evening. I am so
glad it is over! My spirits are quite jaded with listening to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
nonsense: and then, being such a smart young fellow, I saw every eye
was upon us."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very handsome indeed."

<p/>"Handsome! Yes, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) may. I dare say people would admire him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in
general; but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is not at all in my style of beauty. I hate a florid
complexion and dark eyes in a man. However, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very well. Amazingly
conceited, I am sure. I took him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) down several times, you know, in my
way."

<p/>When the young ladies next met, they had a far more interesting subject
to discuss. James Morland’s second letter was then received, and the
kind intentions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) father fully explained. A living, of which Mr.
Morland was himself patron and incumbent, of about four hundred pounds
yearly value, was to be resigned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) son as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) should be old
enough to take it; no trifling deduction from the family income, no
niggardly assignment to one of ten children. An estate of at least
equal value, moreover, was assured as his (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) future inheritance.

<p/>James expressed himself on the occasion with becoming gratitude; and
the necessity of waiting between two and three years before they could
marry, being, however unwelcome, no more than he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) had expected, was
borne by him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) without discontent. Catherine, whose expectations had been
as unfixed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ideas of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father’s income, and whose judgment was
now entirely led by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) brother, felt equally well satisfied, and
heartily congratulated Isabella on having everything so pleasantly
settled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is very charming indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>said Isabella, with a grave face. <div class="bookquote">"Mr.
Morland has behaved vastly handsome indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said the gentle Mrs.
Thorpe, looking anxiously at her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) daughter. "I only wish I could do as
much. One could not expect more from him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>), you know. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) finds he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
_can_ do more by and by, I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) will, for I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) must be
an excellent good-hearted man. Four hundred is but a small income to
begin on indeed, but your wishes, my dear Isabella, are so moderate,
you do not consider how little you ever want, my dear."

<p/>"It is not on my own account I wish for more; but I cannot bear to be
the means of injuring my dear Morland, making him (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) sit down upon an
income hardly enough to find one in the common necessaries of life. For
myself, it is nothing; I never think of myself."

<p/>"I know you never do, my dear; and you will always find your reward in
the affection it makes everybody feel for you. There never was a young
woman so beloved as you are by everybody that knows you; and I dare say
when Mr. Morland sees you, my dear child—but do not let us distress our
dear Catherine by talking of such things. Mr. Morland has behaved so
very handsome, you know. I always heard he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) was a most excellent man;
and you know, my dear, we are not to suppose but what, if you had had a
suitable fortune, he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) would have come down with something more, for I am
sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) must be a most liberal-minded man."

<p/>"Nobody can think better of Mr. Morland than I do, I am sure. But
everybody has their failing, you know, and everybody has a right to do
what they like with their own money.<div class="bookquote">" Catherine was hurt by these
insinuations. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am very sure," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), "that my father has promised
to do as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) can afford.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Isabella recollected herself. " (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>As to that, my sweet Catherine, there
cannot be a doubt, and you know me well enough to be sure that a much
smaller income would satisfy me. It is not the want of more money that
makes me just at present a little out of spirits; I hate money; and if
our union could take place now upon only fifty pounds a year, I should
not have a wish unsatisfied. Ah! my Catherine, you have found me out.
There’s the sting. The long, long, endless two years and half that are
to pass before your brother can hold the living."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, yes, my darling Isabella,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Thorpe</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Thorpe, "we perfectly see
into your heart. You have no disguise. We perfectly understand the
present vexation; and everybody must love you the better for such a
noble honest affection."

<p/>Catherine’s uncomfortable feelings began to lessen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) endeavoured to
believe that the delay of the marriage was the only source of
Isabella’s regret; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) at their next interview as
cheerful and amiable as ever, endeavoured to forget that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had for a
minute thought otherwise. James soon followed his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) letter, and was
received with the most gratifying kindness.
