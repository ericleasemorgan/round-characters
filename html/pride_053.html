<p/>Mr. Wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) never again distressed himself, or provoked his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) dear
sister Elizabeth, by introducing the subject of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
pleased to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had said enough to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) quiet.

<p/>The day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and Lydia’s departure soon came, and Mrs. Bennet
was forced to submit to a separation, which, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband by no
means entered into her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) scheme of their all going to Newcastle,
was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! my dear Lydia,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried, "when shall we meet again?"

<p/>"Oh, lord! I don’t know. Not these two or three years, perhaps."

<p/>"Write to me very often, my dear."

<p/>"As often as I can. But you know married women have never much
time for writing. My sisters may write to _me_. They will have
nothing else to do."

<p/>Mr. Wickham’s adieus were much more affectionate than his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) wife’s.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) smiled, looked handsome, and said many pretty things.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is as fine a fellow,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, as soon as they were
out of the house, "as ever I saw. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) simpers, and smirks, and
makes love to us all. I am prodigiously proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). I defy even
Sir William Lucas himself to produce a more valuable son-in-law.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter made Mrs. Bennet very dull for several
days.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I often think," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), "that there is nothing so bad as
parting with one’s friends. One seems so forlorn without them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is the consequence, you see, Madam, of marrying a
daughter,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. "It must make you better satisfied
that your other four are single."

<p/>"It is no such thing. Lydia does not leave me because she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) is
married, but only because her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband’s regiment happens to be so
far off. If that had been nearer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) would not have gone so
soon."

<p/>But the spiritless condition which this event threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) into was
shortly relieved, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) mind opened again to the agitation of
hope, by an article of news which then began to be in
circulation. The housekeeper at Netherfield had received orders
to prepare for the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>housekeeper</b></font>) master, who was coming down in
a day or two, to shoot there for several weeks. Mrs. Bennet was
quite in the fidgets. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) looked at Jane, and smiled and shook
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) head by turns.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, well, and so Mr. Bingley is coming down, sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Phillips</b></font>)</div>(for
Mrs. Phillips first brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) the news). "Well, so much the
better. Not that I care about it, though. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is nothing to us,
you know, and I am sure I never want to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) again. But,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is very welcome to come to Netherfield, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) likes
it. And who knows what _may_ happen? But that is nothing to us.
You know, sister, we agreed long ago never to mention a word
about it. And so, is it quite certain he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is coming?"

<p/>"You may depend on it,<div class="bookquote">" replied the other, " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Nicholls</b></font>)</div>for Mrs. Nicholls was
in Meryton last night; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) passing by, and went out myself
on purpose to know the truth of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) told me that it was
certain true. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) comes down on Thursday at the latest, very
likely on Wednesday. She (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) was going to the butcher’s, she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) told me,
on purpose to order in some meat on Wednesday, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Nicholls</b></font>) has got
three couple of ducks just fit to be killed."

<p/>Miss Bennet had not been able to hear of his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) coming without
changing colour. It was many months since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>)
name to Elizabeth; but now, as soon as they were alone together,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) said:

<p/>"I saw you look at me to-day, Lizzy, when my aunt told us of the
present report; and I know I appeared distressed. But don’t
imagine it was from any silly cause. I was only confused for the
moment, because I felt that I _should_ be looked at. I do assure
you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or
pain. I am glad of one thing, that he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) comes alone; because we
shall see the less of him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>). Not that I am afraid of _myself_, but
I dread other people’s remarks."

<p/>Elizabeth did not know what to make of it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) not seen him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)
in Derbyshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have supposed him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) capable of coming
there with no other view than what was acknowledged; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
still thought him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) partial to Jane, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wavered as to the
greater probability of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) coming there _with_ his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) friend’s
permission, or being bold enough to come without it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yet it is hard,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sometimes thought, "that this poor man
cannot come to a house which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has legally hired, without
raising all this speculation! I _will_ leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to himself."

<p/>In spite of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister declared, and really believed to be
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feelings in the expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) arrival, Elizabeth could
easily perceive that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits were affected by it. They were
more disturbed, more unequal, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had often seen them.

<p/>The subject which had been so warmly canvassed between their
parents, about a twelvemonth ago, was now brought forward again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As soon as ever Mr. Bingley comes, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet,
<div class="bookquote">"you will wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of course."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, no. You forced me into visiting him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) last year, and promised,
if I went to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should marry one of my daughters. But it
ended in nothing, and I will not be sent on a fool’s errand
again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wife represented to him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) how absolutely necessary such an
attention would be from all the neighbouring gentlemen, on his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
returning to Netherfield.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>’Tis an _etiquette_ I despise," said he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). "If he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) wants our
society, let him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) seek it. He (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) knows where we live. I will not
spend _my_ hours in running after my neighbours every time they
go away and come back again."

<p/>"Well, all I know is, that it will be abominably rude if you do
not wait on him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>). But, however, that shan’t prevent my asking him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)
to dine here, I am determined. We must have Mrs. Long and the
Gouldings soon. That will make thirteen with ourselves, so there
will be just room at table for him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)."

<p/>Consoled by this resolution, she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) was the better able to bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>)
husband’s incivility; though it was very mortifying to know that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) neighbours might all see Mr. Bingley, in consequence of it,
before _they_ did. As the day of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) arrival drew near,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I begin to be sorry that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) comes at all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister. "It would be nothing; I could see him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) with perfect
indifference, but I can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually
talked of. My mother means well; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not know, no one
can know, how much I suffer from what she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) says. Happy shall I be,
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) stay at Netherfield is over!"

<p/>"I wish I could say anything to comfort you," replied Elizabeth;
"but it is wholly out of my power. You must feel it; and the
usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied
me, because you have always so much."

<p/>Mr. Bingley arrived. Mrs. Bennet, through the assistance of
servants, contrived to have the earliest tidings of it, that the
period of anxiety and fretfulness on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) side might be as long as
it could. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) counted the days that must intervene before their
invitation could be sent; hopeless of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) before. But on
the third morning after his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) arrival in Hertfordshire, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) saw
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) dressing-room window, enter the paddock and ride
towards the house.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters were eagerly called to partake of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) joy. Jane
resolutely kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) place at the table; but Elizabeth, to satisfy
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, went to the window—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw Mr. Darcy with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and sat down again by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is a gentleman with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), mamma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>said Kitty; <div class="bookquote">"who can it
be?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Some acquaintance or other, my dear, I suppose; I am sure I do
not know."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"La!"  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>replied Kitty, "it looks just like that man that used to be
with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) before. Mr. what’s-his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)-name. That tall, proud man."

<p/>"Good gracious! Mr. Darcy!—and so it does, I vow. Well, any
friend of Mr. Bingley’s will always be welcome here, to be sure;
but else I must say that I hate the very sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)."

<p/>Jane looked at Elizabeth with surprise and concern. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew but
little of their meeting in Derbyshire, and therefore felt for the
awkwardness which must attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) almost
for the first time after receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) explanatory letter. Both
sisters were uncomfortable enough. Each felt for the other, and
of course for themselves; and their mother talked on, of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
dislike of Mr. Darcy, and her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) resolution to be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) only
as Mr. Bingley’s friend, without being heard by either of them.
But Elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be
suspected by Jane, to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never yet had courage to shew
Mrs. Gardiner’s letter, or to relate her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) own change of sentiment
towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). To Jane, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could be only a man whose proposals she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
had refused, and whose merit she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had undervalued; but to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own
more extensive information, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was the person to whom the whole
family were indebted for the first of benefits, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
regarded herself with an interest, if not quite so tender, at
least as reasonable and just as what Jane felt for Bingley. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
astonishment at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming—at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming to Netherfield, to
Longbourn, and voluntarily seeking her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) again, was almost equal to
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had known on first witnessing his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) altered behaviour in
Derbyshire.

<p/>The colour which had been driven from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) face, returned for half
a minute with an additional glow, and a smile of delight added
lustre to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought for that space of time that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) affection and wishes must still be unshaken. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would
not be secure.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Let me first see how he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) behaves,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"it will then be
early enough for expectation."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sat intently at work, striving to be composed, and without
daring to lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eyes, till anxious curiosity carried them
to the face of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister as the servant was approaching the
door. Jane looked a little paler than usual, but more sedate than
Elizabeth had expected. On the gentlemen’s appearing, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) colour
increased; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) received them with tolerable ease, and with a
propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of
resentment or any unnecessary complaisance.

<p/>Elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow, and
sat down again to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) work, with an eagerness which it did not
often command. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had ventured only one glance at Darcy. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
looked serious, as usual; and, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought, more as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been
used to look in Hertfordshire, than as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at
Pemberley. But, perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s presence be
what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt. It was a painful, but not
an improbable, conjecture.

<p/>Bingley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had likewise seen for an instant, and in that short
period saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) looking both pleased and embarrassed. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was
received by Mrs. Bennet with a degree of civility which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
two daughters ashamed, especially when contrasted with the cold
and ceremonious politeness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) curtsey and address to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
friend.

<p/>Elizabeth, particularly, who knew that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother owed to the
latter the preservation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favourite daughter from
irremediable infamy, was hurt and distressed to a most painful
degree by a distinction so ill applied.

<p/>Darcy, after enquiring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) how Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner did, a
question which she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) could not answer without confusion, said
scarcely anything. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was not seated by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>); perhaps that was the
reason of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) silence; but it had not been so in Derbyshire.
There he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) friends, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not to herself.
But now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
voice; and when occasionally, unable to resist the impulse of
curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) eyes to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) face, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) as often found
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looking at Jane as at herself, and frequently on no object
but the ground. More thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please,
than when they last met, were plainly expressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was
disappointed, and angry with herself for being so.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Could I expect it to be otherwise!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"Yet why did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
come?"

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was in no humour for conversation with anyone but himself;
and to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had hardly courage to speak.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) enquired after his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister, but could do no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a long time, Mr. Bingley, since you went away,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs.
Bennet.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) readily agreed to it.

<p/>"I began to be afraid you would never come back again. People
_did_ say you meant to quit the place entirely at Michaelmas;
but, however, I hope it is not true. A great many changes have
happened in the neighbourhood, since you went away. Miss Lucas is
married and settled. And one of my own daughters. I suppose you
have heard of it; indeed, you must have seen it in the papers. It
was in The Times and The Courier, I know; though it was not put
in as it ought to be. It was only said, <div class="bookquote">‘Lately, George Wickham,
Esq. to Miss Lydia Bennet,’  (<font color='red'><b>father place</b></font>)</div>without there being a syllable said
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) father, or the place where she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lived, or anything. It was
my brother Gardiner’s drawing up too, and I wonder how he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came to
make such an awkward business of it. Did you see it?"

<p/>Bingley replied that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did, and made his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) congratulations.
Elizabeth dared not lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes. How Mr. Darcy looked,
therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not tell.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a delightful thing, to be sure, to have a daughter well
married,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>continued her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) mother, "but at the same time, Mr.
Bingley, it is very hard to have her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) taken such a way from me.
They are gone down to Newcastle, a place quite northward, it
seems, and there they are to stay I do not know how long. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
regiment is there; for I suppose you have heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) leaving
the ——shire, and of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being gone into the regulars. Thank
Heaven! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has _some_ friends, though perhaps not so many as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
deserves."

<p/>Elizabeth, who knew this to be levelled at Mr. Darcy, was in such
misery of shame, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could hardly keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seat. It drew
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), however, the exertion of speaking, which nothing else
had so effectually done before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked Bingley whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
meant to make any stay in the country at present. A few weeks, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
believed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When you have killed all your own birds, Mr. Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother, "I beg you will come here, and shoot as many as you
please on Mr. Bennet’s manor. I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) will be vastly happy
to oblige you, and will save all the best of the covies for you."

<p/>Elizabeth’s misery increased, at such unnecessary, such officious
attention! Were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had
flattered them a year ago, every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was persuaded, would
be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion. At that instant,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that years of happiness could not make Jane or herself
amends for moments of such painful confusion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The first wish of my heart,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to herself, "is never more
to be in company with either of them. Their society can afford no
pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this! Let me
never see either one or the other again!"

<p/>Yet the misery, for which years of happiness were to offer no
compensation, received soon afterwards material relief, from
observing how much the beauty of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister re-kindled the
admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) former lover. When first he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) came in, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) had
spoken to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) but little; but every five minutes seemed to be
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) more of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) attention. He (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as handsome as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
had been last year; as good natured, and as unaffected, though
not quite so chatty. Jane was anxious that no difference should
be perceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) at all, and was really persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
talked as much as ever. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mind was so busily engaged, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not always know when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was silent.

<p/>When the gentlemen rose to go away, Mrs. Bennet was mindful of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) intended civility, and they were invited and engaged to dine
at Longbourn in a few days time.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are quite a visit in my debt, Mr. Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) added, "for
when you went to town last winter, you promised to take a family
dinner with us, as soon as you returned. I have not forgot, you
see; and I assure you, I was very much disappointed that you did
not come back and keep your engagement."

<p/>Bingley looked a little silly at this reflection, and said
something of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) concern at having been prevented by business.
They then went away.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and
dine there that day; but, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) always kept a very good
table, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did not think anything less than two courses could be
good enough for a man on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had such anxious designs, or
satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a
year.
