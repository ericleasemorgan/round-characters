<p/>It was not in Miss Crawford’s power to talk Fanny into any real
forgetfulness of what had passed. When the evening was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went
to bed full of it, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) nerves still agitated by the shock of such an
attack from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousin Tom, so public and so persevered in, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
spirits sinking under her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s unkind reflection and reproach. To be
called into notice in such a manner, to hear that it was but the
prelude to something so infinitely worse, to be told that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must do
what was so impossible as to act; and then to have the charge of
obstinacy and ingratitude follow it, enforced with such a hint at the
dependence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) situation, had been too distressing at the time to
make the remembrance when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was alone much less so, especially with
the superadded dread of what the morrow might produce in continuation
of the subject. Miss Crawford had protected her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) only for the time; and
if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were applied to again among themselves with all the
authoritative urgency that Tom and Maria were capable of, and Edmund
perhaps away, what should she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) do? She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) fell asleep before she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could
answer the question, and found it quite as puzzling when she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) awoke the
next morning. The little white attic, which had continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
sleeping-room ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) first entering the family, proving
incompetent to suggest any reply, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had recourse, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was
dressed, to another apartment more spacious and more meet for walking
about in and thinking, and of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had now for some time been
almost equally mistress. It had been their school-room; so called till
the Miss Bertrams would not allow it to be called so any longer, and
inhabited as such to a later period. There Miss Lee had lived, and
there they had read and written, and talked and laughed, till within
the last three years, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lee</b></font>) had quitted them. The room had then
become useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny,
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plants, or wanted one of the books, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and
accommodation in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) little chamber above: but gradually, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) value
for the comforts of it increased, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) possessions, and
spent more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) time there; and having nothing to oppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), had so
naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now
generally admitted to be hers. The East room, as it had been called
ever since Maria Bertram was sixteen, was now considered Fanny’s,
almost as decidedly as the white attic: the smallness of the one making
the use of the other so evidently reasonable that the Miss Bertrams,
with every superiority in their own apartments which their own sense of
superiority could demand, were entirely approving it; and Mrs. Norris,
having stipulated for there never being a fire in it on Fanny’s
account, was tolerably resigned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having the use of what nobody
else wanted, though the terms in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sometimes spoke of the
indulgence seemed to imply that it was the best room in the house.

<p/>The aspect was so favourable that even without a fire it was habitable
in many an early spring and late autumn morning to such a willing mind
as Fanny’s; and while there was a gleam of sunshine she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped not to be
driven from it entirely, even when winter came. The comfort of it in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hours of leisure was extreme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could go there after anything
unpleasant below, and find immediate consolation in some pursuit, or
some train of thought at hand. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) plants, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) books—of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
been a collector from the first hour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) commanding a shilling—her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
writing-desk, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) works of charity and ingenuity, were all within
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) reach; or if indisposed for employment, if nothing but musing would
do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could scarcely see an object in that room which had not an
interesting remembrance connected with it. Everything was a friend, or
bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thoughts to a friend; and though there had been sometimes much
of suffering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); though her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) motives had often been misunderstood,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings disregarded, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) comprehension undervalued; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had known the pains of tyranny, of ridicule, and neglect, yet almost
every recurrence of either had led to something consolatory: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Bertram had spoken for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), or Miss Lee had been encouraging, or, what
was yet more frequent or more dear, Edmund had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) champion and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) friend: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cause or explained her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to cry, or had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) some proof of affection which
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears delightful; and the whole was now so blended together,
so harmonised by distance, that every former affliction had its charm.
The room was most dear to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not have changed its
furniture for the handsomest in the house, though what had been
originally plain had suffered all the ill-usage of children; and its
greatest elegancies and ornaments were a faded footstool of Julia’s
work, too ill done for the drawing-room, three transparencies, made in
a rage for transparencies, for the three lower panes of one window,
where Tintern Abbey held its station between a cave in Italy and a
moonlight lake in Cumberland, a collection of family profiles, thought
unworthy of being anywhere else, over the mantelpiece, and by their
side, and pinned against the wall, a small sketch of a ship sent four
years ago from the Mediterranean by William, with H.M.S. Antwerp at the
bottom, in letters as tall as the mainmast.

<p/>To this nest of comforts Fanny now walked down to try its influence on
an agitated, doubting spirit, to see if by looking at Edmund’s profile
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could catch any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) counsel, or by giving air to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) geraniums
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) might inhale a breeze of mental strength herself. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had more
than fears of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own perseverance to remove: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had begun to feel
undecided as to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _ought_ _to_ _do_; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked round the
room her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubts were increasing. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _right_ in refusing what was
so warmly asked, so strongly wished for—what might be so essential to a
scheme on which some of those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) owed the greatest
complaisance had set their hearts? Was it not ill-nature, selfishness,
and a fear of exposing herself? And would Edmund’s judgment, would his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
persuasion of Sir Thomas’s disapprobation of the whole, be enough to
justify her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a determined denial in spite of all the rest? It would
be so horrible to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to act that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was inclined to suspect the truth
and purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own scruples; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), the
claims of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins to being obliged were strengthened by the sight
of present upon present that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had received from them. The table
between the windows was covered with work-boxes and netting-boxes which
had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at different times, principally by Tom; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) grew
bewildered as to the amount of the debt which all these kind
remembrances produced. A tap at the door roused her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in the midst of
this attempt to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) duty, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gentle "Come in" was
answered by the appearance of one, before whom all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) doubts were wont
to be laid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes brightened at the sight of Edmund.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Can I speak with you, Fanny, for a few minutes?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, certainly."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I want to consult. I want your opinion."

<p/>"My opinion!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, shrinking from such a compliment, highly as it
gratified her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Yes, your advice and opinion. I do not know what to do. This acting
scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a
play as they could, and now, to complete the business, are going to ask
the help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the
end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I
know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must
spring from his (<font color='blue'><b>Maddox</b></font>) being admitted among us in this manner is highly
objectionable, the _more_ than intimacy—the familiarity. I cannot think
of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such
magnitude as must, _if_ _possible_, be prevented. Do not you see it in
the same light?"

<p/>"Yes; but what can be done? Your brother is so determined."

<p/>"There is but _one_ thing to be done, Fanny. I must take Anhalt myself.
I am well aware that nothing else will quiet Tom.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny could not answer him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It is not at all what I like," he (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>) continued. "No man can like being
driven into the _appearance_ of such inconsistency. After being known
to oppose the scheme from the beginning, there is absurdity in the face
of my joining them _now_, when they are exceeding their first plan in
every respect; but I can think of no other alternative. Can you,
Fanny?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny slowly, "not immediately, but—"

<p/>"But what? I see your judgment is not with me. Think it a little over.
Perhaps you are not so much aware as I am of the mischief that _may_,
of the unpleasantness that _must_ arise from a young man’s being
received in this manner: domesticated among us; authorised to come at
all hours, and placed suddenly on a footing which must do away all
restraints. To think only of the licence which every rehearsal must
tend to create. It is all very bad! Put yourself in Miss Crawford’s
place, Fanny. Consider what it would be to act Amelia with a stranger.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) has a right to be felt for, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) evidently feels for
herself. I heard enough of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) said to you last night to
understand her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) unwillingness to be acting with a stranger; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
probably engaged in the part with different expectations—perhaps
without considering the subject enough to know what was likely to be—it
would be ungenerous, it would be really wrong to expose her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) to it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>)
feelings ought to be respected. Does it not strike you so, Fanny? You
hesitate."

<p/>"I am sorry for Miss Crawford; but I am more sorry to see you drawn in
to do what you had resolved against, and what you are known to think
will be disagreeable to my uncle. It will be such a triumph to the
others!"

<p/>"They will not have much cause of triumph when they see how infamously
I act. But, however, triumph there certainly will be, and I must brave
it. But if I can be the means of restraining the publicity of the
business, of limiting the exhibition, of concentrating our folly, I
shall be well repaid. As I am now, I have no influence, I can do
nothing: I have offended them, and they will not hear me; but when I
have put them in good-humour by this concession, I am not without hopes
of persuading them to confine the representation within a much smaller
circle than they are now in the high road for. This will be a material
gain. My object is to confine it to Mrs. Rushworth and the Grants. Will
not this be worth gaining?"

<p/>"Yes, it will be a great point."

<p/>"But still it has not your approbation. Can you mention any other
measure by which I have a chance of doing equal good?"

<p/>"No, I cannot think of anything else."

<p/>"Give me your approbation, then, Fanny. I am not comfortable without
it."

<p/>"Oh, cousin!"

<p/>"If you are against me, I ought to distrust myself, and yet—But it is
absolutely impossible to let Tom go on in this way, riding about the
country in quest of anybody who can be persuaded to act—no matter whom:
the look of a gentleman is to be enough. I thought _you_ would have
entered more into Miss Crawford’s feelings."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) will be very glad. It must be a great relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),"
 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, trying for greater warmth of manner.

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) never appeared more amiable than in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) behaviour to you last
night. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a very strong claim on my goodwill."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) _was_ very kind, indeed, and I am glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spared" (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>...

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not finish the generous effusion. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conscience stopt her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in
the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall walk down immediately after breakfast,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), "and am sure
of giving pleasure there. And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you
any longer. You want to be reading. But I could not be easy till I had
spoken to you, and come to a decision. Sleeping or waking, my head has
been full of this matter all night. It is an evil, but I am certainly
making it less than it might be. If Tom is up, I shall go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tom</b></font>)
directly and get it over, and when we meet at breakfast we shall be all
in high good-humour at the prospect of acting the fool together with
such unanimity. _You_, in the meanwhile, will be taking a trip into
China, I suppose. How does Lord Macartney go on?<div class="bookquote">"—opening a volume on
the table and then taking up some others. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And here are Crabbe’s Tales,
and the Idler, at hand to relieve you, if you tire of your great book.
I admire your little establishment exceedingly; and as soon as I am
gone, you will empty your head of all this nonsense of acting, and sit
comfortably down to your table. But do not stay here to be cold."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) went; but there was no reading, no China, no composure for Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>)
had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the most extraordinary, the most inconceivable, the most
unwelcome news; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could think of nothing else. To be acting!
After all his (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) objections—objections so just and so public! After all
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) say, and seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) look, and known him (<font color='blue'><b>Crabbe</b></font>) to be
feeling. Could it be possible? Edmund so inconsistent! Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) not
deceiving himself? Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) not wrong? Alas! it was all Miss Crawford’s
doing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) influence in every speech, and was miserable.
The doubts and alarms as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own conduct, which had previously
distressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and which had all slept while she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), were
become of little consequence now. This deeper anxiety swallowed them
up. Things should take their course; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cared not how it ended. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousins might attack, but could hardly tease her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was beyond their
reach; and if at last obliged to yield—no matter—it was all misery now.
