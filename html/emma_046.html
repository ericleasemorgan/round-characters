<p/>One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who <div class="bookquote">"could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) met her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did, in the natural key of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father,

<p/>"Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning? Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must see you."

<p/>"Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) unwell?"

<p/>"No, no, not at all only a little agitated. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would have ordered the carriage, and come to you, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must see you alone, and that you know (nodding towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father) Humph! Can you come?"

<p/>"Certainly. This moment, if you please. It is impossible to refuse what you ask in such a way. But what can be the matter? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) really not ill?"

<p/>"Depend upon me but ask no more questions. You will know it all in time. The most unaccountable business! But hush, hush!"

<p/>To guess what all this meant, was impossible even for Emma. Something really important seemed announced by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) looks; but, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend was well, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) endeavoured not to be uneasy, and settling it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walk now, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Weston were soon out of the house together and on their way at a quick pace for Randalls.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, when they were fairly beyond the sweep gates, "now Mr. Weston, do let me know what has happened."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, no,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) gravely replied. "Don't ask me. I promised my wife to leave it all to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will break it to you better than I can. Do not be impatient, Emma; it will all come out too soon."

<p/>"Break it to me,<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma, standing still with terror. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Good God! Mr. Weston, tell me at once. Something has happened in Brunswick Square. I know it has. Tell me, I charge you tell me this moment what it is."

<p/>"No, indeed you are mistaken.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weston do not trifle with me. Consider how many of my dearest friends are now in Brunswick Square. Which of them is it? I charge you by all that is sacred, not to attempt concealment."

<p/>"Upon my word, Emma."

<p/>"Your word! why not your honour! why not say upon your honour, that it has nothing to do with any of them? Good Heavens! What can be to be broke to me, that does not relate to one of that family?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my honour,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) very seriously, "it does not. It is not in the smallest degree connected with any human being of the name of Knightley.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma's courage returned, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I was wrong," he (<font color='blue'><b>friends</b></font>) continued, "in talking of its being broke to you. I should not have used the expression. In fact, it does not concern you it concerns only myself, that is, we hope. Humph! In short, my dear Emma, there is no occasion to be so uneasy about it. I don't say that it is not a disagreeable business but things might be much worse. If we walk fast, we shall soon be at Randalls."

<p/>Emma found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait; and now it required little effort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the probability of its being some money concern something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family, something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps and poor Frank cut off! This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Who is that gentleman on horseback?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as they proceeded speaking more to assist Mr. Weston in keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) secret, than with any other view.

<p/>"I do not know. One of the Otways. Not Frank; it is not Frank, I assure you. You will not see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is half way to Windsor by this time."

<p/>"Has your son been with you, then?"

<p/>"Oh! yes did not you know? Well, well, never mind.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>For a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was silent; and then added, in a tone much more guarded and demure,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>Yes, Frank came over this morning, just to ask us how we did.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They hurried on, and were speedily at Randalls. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, my dear," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), as they entered the room "I have brought her (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), and now I hope you will soon be better. I shall leave you together. There is no use in delay. I shall not be far off, if you want me." And Emma distinctly heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) add, in a lower tone, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) quitted the room, "I have been as good as my word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has not the least idea."

<p/>Mrs. Weston was looking so ill, and had an air of so much perturbation, that Emma's uneasiness increased; and the moment they were alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eagerly said,

<p/>"What is it my dear friend? Something of a very unpleasant nature, I find, has occurred; do let me know directly what it is. I have been walking all this way in complete suspense. We both abhor suspense. Do not let mine continue longer. It will do you good to speak of your distress, whatever it may be."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Have you indeed no idea?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston in a trembling voice. "Cannot you, my dear Emma cannot you form a guess as to what you are to hear?"

<p/>"So far as that it relates to Mr. Frank Churchill, I do guess."

<p/>"You are right. It does relate to him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), and I will tell you directly;<div class="bookquote">" (resuming her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) work, and seeming resolved against looking up.) " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) has been here this very morning, on a most extraordinary errand. It is impossible to express our surprize. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) came to speak to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) father on a subject, to announce an attachment "

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stopped to breathe. Emma thought first of herself, and then of Harriet.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"More than an attachment, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>resumed Mrs. Weston; "an engagement a positive engagement. What will you say, Emma what will any body say, when it is known that Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax are engaged; nay, that they have been long engaged!"

<p/>Emma even jumped with surprize; and, horror-struck, exclaimed,

<p/>"Jane Fairfax! Good God! You are not serious? You do not mean it?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may well be amazed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Weston, still averting her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) eyes, and talking on with eagerness, that Emma might have time to recover  "You may well be amazed. But it is even so. There has been a solemn engagement between them ever since October formed at Weymouth, and kept a secret from every body. Not a creature knowing it but themselves neither the Campbells, nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It is so wonderful, that though perfectly convinced of the fact, it is yet almost incredible to myself. I can hardly believe it. I thought I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>)."

<p/>Emma scarcely heard what was said. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind was divided between two ideas her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own former conversations with him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) about Miss Fairfax; and poor Harriet; and for some time she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could only exclaim, and require confirmation, repeated confirmation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) at last, trying to recover herself; "this is a circumstance which I must think of at least half a day, before I can at all comprehend it. What! engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) all the winter before either of them came to Highbury?"

<p/>"Engaged since October, secretly engaged. It has hurt me, Emma, very much. It has hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) father equally. Some part of his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) conduct we cannot excuse."

<p/>Emma pondered a moment, and then replied, "I will not pretend not to understand you; and to give you all the relief in my power, be assured that no such effect has followed his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) attentions to me, as you are apprehensive of.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Weston looked up, afraid to believe; but Emma's countenance was as steady as her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) words.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>That you may have less difficulty in believing this boast, of my present perfect indifference," she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) continued, "I will farther tell you, that there was a period in the early part of our acquaintance, when I did like him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), when I was very much disposed to be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) nay, was attached and how it came to cease, is perhaps the wonder. Fortunately, however, it did cease. I have really for some time past, for at least these three months, cared nothing about him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>). You may believe me, Mrs. Weston. This is the simple truth.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Weston kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) with tears of joy; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could find utterance, assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), that this protestation had done her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more good than any thing else in the world could do.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>Mr. Weston will be almost as much relieved as myself," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). "On this point we have been wretched. It was our darling wish that you might be attached to each other and we were persuaded that it was so.  Imagine what we have been feeling on your account."

<p/>"I have escaped; and that I should escape, may be a matter of grateful wonder to you and myself. But this does not acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), Mrs. Weston; and I must say, that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) greatly to blame. What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to come among us with affection and faith engaged, and with manners so very disengaged? What right had he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to endeavour to please, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did to distinguish any one young woman with persevering attention, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) certainly did while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) really belonged to another? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) tell what mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might be doing? How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) tell that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might not be making me in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)? very wrong, very wrong indeed."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"From something that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) said, my dear Emma, I rather imagine "

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"And how could she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bear such behaviour! Composure with a witness! to look on, while repeated attentions were offering to another woman, before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) face, and not resent it. That is a degree of placidity, which I can neither comprehend nor respect."

<p/>"There were misunderstandings between them, Emma; he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) said so expressly. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) had not time to enter into much explanation. He (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) was here only a quarter of an hour, and in a state of agitation which did not allow the full use even of the time he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) could stay but that there had been misunderstandings he (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) decidedly said. The present crisis, indeed, seemed to be brought on by them; and those misunderstandings might very possibly arise from the impropriety of his (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) conduct."

<p/>"Impropriety! Oh! Mrs. Weston it is too calm a censure. Much, much beyond impropriety! It has sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>), I cannot say how it has sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>witness</b></font>) in my opinion. So unlike what a man should be! None of that upright integrity, that strict adherence to truth and principle, that disdain of trick and littleness, which a man should display in every transaction of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life."

<p/>"Nay, dear Emma, now I must take his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) part; for though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has been wrong in this instance, I have known him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) long enough to answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) having many, very many, good qualities; and "

<p/>"Good God!<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma, not attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Smallridge, too! Jane actually on the point of going as governess! What could he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) mean by such horrible indelicacy? To suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to engage herself to suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) even to think of such a measure!"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction. Till yesterday, I know he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) was in the dark as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plans. They burst on him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>), I do not know how, but by some letter or message and it was the discovery of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) to come forward at once, own it all to his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) uncle, throw himself on his (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma began to listen better.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I am to hear from him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) soon," continued Mrs. Weston. "He (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) told me at parting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) should soon write; and he (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) spoke in a manner which seemed to promise me many particulars that could not be given now. Let us wait, therefore, for this letter. It may bring many extenuations. It may make many things intelligible and excusable which now are not to be understood. Don't let us be severe, don't let us be in a hurry to condemn him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>). Let us have patience. I must love him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>); and now that I am satisfied on one point, the one material point, I am sincerely anxious for its all turning out well, and ready to hope that it may. They must both have suffered a great deal under such a system of secresy and concealment."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) sufferings,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma dryly, "do not appear to have done him (<font color='blue'><b>God</b></font>) much harm. Well, and how did Mr. Churchill take it?"

<p/>"Most favourably for his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) consent with scarcely a difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility; but scarcely are her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) remains at rest in the family vault, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave! He (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) gave his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) consent with very little persuasion."

<p/>"Ah!<div class="bookquote">" thought Emma, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) would have done as much for Harriet."

<p/>"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) uncle, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) could stay with us but a quarter of an hour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) was very much agitated very much, indeed to a degree that made him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) before. In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) so very unwell, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had had no previous suspicion of and there was every appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) having been feeling a great deal."

<p/>"And do you really believe the affair to have been carrying on with such perfect secresy? The Campbells, the Dixons, did none of them know of the engagement?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma could not speak the name of Dixon without a little blush.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>None; not one. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) positively said that it had been known to no being in the world but their two selves."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "I suppose we shall gradually grow reconciled to the idea, and I wish them very happy. But I shall always think it a very abominable sort of proceeding. What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit, espionage, and treachery? To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all! Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear. They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am quite easy on that head,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs. Weston. "I am very sure that I never said any thing of either to the other, which both might not have heard."

<p/>"You are in luck. Your only blunder was confined to my ear, when you imagined a certain friend of ours in love with the lady."

<p/>"True. But as I have always had a thoroughly good opinion of Miss Fairfax, I never could, under any blunder, have spoken ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>); and as to speaking ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), there I must have been safe."

<p/>At this moment Mr. Weston appeared at a little distance from the window, evidently on the watch. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a look which invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in; and, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) heart at ease, and incline him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of it and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), for Frank, I mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) credit for and still am disposed to give her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right. And how much may be said in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) situation for even that error!"

<p/>"Much, indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Emma feelingly. " (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's. Of such, one may almost say, that <div class="bookquote">'the world is not their's, nor the world's law.' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) met Mr. Weston on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) entrance, with a smiling countenance, exclaiming,

<p/>"A very pretty trick you have been playing me, upon my word! This was a device, I suppose, to sport with my curiosity, and exercise my talent of guessing. But you really frightened me. I thought you had lost half your property, at least. And here, instead of its being a matter of condolence, it turns out to be one of congratulation. I congratulate you, Mr. Weston, with all my heart, on the prospect of having one of the most lovely and accomplished young women in England for your daughter."

<p/>A glance or two between him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife, convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that all was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits was immediate. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shook her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had talked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done.
