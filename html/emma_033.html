<p/>Emma was not required, by any subsequent discovery, to retract her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ill opinion of Mrs. Elton. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) observation had been pretty correct. Such as Mrs. Elton appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) on this second interview, such she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) appeared whenever they met again, self-important, presuming, familiar, ignorant, and ill-bred. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had a little beauty and a little accomplishment, but so little judgment that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought herself coming with superior knowledge of the world, to enliven and improve a country neighbourhood; and conceived Miss Hawkins to have held such a place in society as Mrs. Elton's consequence only could surpass.

<p/>There was no reason to suppose Mr. Elton thought at all differently from his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wife. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed not merely happy with her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but proud. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had the air of congratulating himself on having brought such a woman to Highbury, as not even Miss Woodhouse could equal; and the greater part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) new acquaintance, disposed to commend, or not in the habit of judging, following the lead of Miss Bates's good-will, or taking it for granted that the bride must be as clever and as agreeable as she (<font color='blue'><b>bride</b></font>) professed herself, were very well satisfied; so that Mrs. Elton's praise passed from one mouth to another as it ought to do, unimpeded by Miss Woodhouse, who readily continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) first contribution and talked with a good grace of her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) being <div class="bookquote">"very pleasant and very elegantly dressed."

 (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div><p/>In one respect Mrs. Elton grew even worse than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had appeared at first. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings altered towards Emma. Offended, probably, by the little encouragement which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) proposals of intimacy met with, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) drew back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) turn and gradually became much more cold and distant; and though the effect was agreeable, the ill-will which produced it was necessarily increasing Emma's dislike. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) manners, too and Mr. Elton's, were unpleasant towards Harriet. They were sneering and negligent. Emma hoped it must rapidly work Harriet's cure; but the sensations which could prompt such behaviour sunk them both very much. It was not to be doubted that poor Harriet's attachment had been an offering to conjugal unreserve, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own share in the story, under a colouring the least favourable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and the most soothing to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), had in all likelihood been given also. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, of course, the object of their joint dislike. When they had nothing else to say, it must be always easy to begin abusing Miss Woodhouse; and the enmity which they dared not shew in open disrespect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), found a broader vent in contemptuous treatment of Harriet.

<p/>Mrs. Elton took a great fancy to Jane Fairfax; and from the first. Not merely when a state of warfare with one young lady might be supposed to recommend the other, but from the very first; and she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was not satisfied with expressing a natural and reasonable admiration but without solicitation, or plea, or privilege, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) must be wanting to assist and befriend her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). Before Emma had forfeited her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) confidence, and about the third time of their meeting, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heard all Mrs. Elton's knight-errantry on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Jane Fairfax is absolutely charming, Miss Woodhouse. I quite rave about Jane Fairfax. A sweet, interesting creature. So mild and ladylike and with such talents! I assure you I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has very extraordinary talents. I do not scruple to say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) plays extremely well. I know enough of music to speak decidedly on that point. Oh! she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is absolutely charming! You will laugh at my warmth but, upon my word, I talk of nothing but Jane Fairfax. And her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation is so calculated to affect one! Miss Woodhouse, we must exert ourselves and endeavour to do something for her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>). We must bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) forward. Such talent as hers must not be suffered to remain unknown. I dare say you have heard those charming lines of the poet,

<p/>' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Full many a flower is born to blush unseen, 'And waste its fragrance on the desert air.'


<p/>We must not allow them to be verified in sweet Jane Fairfax."

<p/>"I cannot think there is any danger of it,<div class="bookquote">" was Emma's calm answer " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and when you are better acquainted with Miss Fairfax's situation and understand what her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) home has been, with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell, I have no idea that you will suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) talents can be unknown."

<p/>"Oh! but dear Miss Woodhouse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is now in such retirement, such obscurity, so thrown away. Whatever advantages she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) may have enjoyed with the Campbells are so palpably at an end! And I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feels it. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) does. She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) is very timid and silent. One can see that she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) feels the want of encouragement. I like her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) the better for it. I must confess it is a recommendation to me. I am a great advocate for timidity and I am sure one does not often meet with it. But in those who are at all inferior, it is extremely prepossessing. Oh! I assure you, Jane Fairfax is a very delightful character, and interests me more than I can express."

<p/>"You appear to feel a great deal but I am not aware how you or any of Miss Fairfax's acquaintance here, any of those who have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) longer than yourself, can shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) any other attention than"

<p/>"My dear Miss Woodhouse, a vast deal may be done by those who dare to act. You and I need not be afraid. If we set the example, many will follow it as far as they can; though all have not our situations. We have carriages to fetch and convey her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) home, and we live in a style which could not make the addition of Jane Fairfax, at any time, the least inconvenient. I should be extremely displeased if Wright were to send us up such a dinner, as could make me regret having asked more than Jane Fairfax to partake of it. I have no idea of that sort of thing. It is not likely that I should, considering what I have been used to. My greatest danger, perhaps, in housekeeping, may be quite the other way, in doing too much, and being too careless of expense. Maple Grove will probably be my model more than it ought to be for we do not at all affect to equal my brother, Mr. Suckling, in income. However, my resolution is taken as to noticing Jane Fairfax. I shall certainly have her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) very often at my house, shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wherever I can, shall have musical parties to draw out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) talents, and shall be constantly on the watch for an eligible situation. My acquaintance is so very extensive, that I have little doubt of hearing of something to suit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) shortly. I shall introduce her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), of course, very particularly to my brother and sister when they come to us. I am sure they will like her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) extremely; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) gets a little acquainted with them, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fears will completely wear off, for there really is nothing in the manners of either but what is highly conciliating. I shall have her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) very often indeed while they are with me, and I dare say we shall sometimes find a seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) in the barouche-landau in some of our exploring parties."

<p/>"Poor Jane Fairfax!<div class="bookquote">" thought Emma. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You have not deserved this. You may have done wrong with regard to Mr. Dixon, but this is a punishment beyond what you can have merited! The kindness and protection of Mrs. Elton! <div class="bookquote">'Jane Fairfax and Jane Fairfax.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Heavens! Let me not suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) dares go about, Emma Woodhouse-ing me! But upon my honour, there seems no limits to the licentiousness of that woman's tongue!"

<p/>Emma had not to listen to such paradings again to any so exclusively addressed to herself so disgustingly decorated with a "dear Miss Woodhouse." The change on Mrs. Elton's side soon afterwards appeared, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was left in peace neither forced to be the very particular friend of Mrs. Elton, nor, under Mrs. Elton's guidance, the very active patroness of Jane Fairfax, and only sharing with others in a general way, in knowing what was felt, what was meditated, what was done.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) looked on with some amusement. Miss Bates's gratitude for Mrs. Elton's attentions to Jane was in the first style of guileless simplicity and warmth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) worthies the most amiable, affable, delightful woman just as accomplished and condescending as Mrs. Elton meant to be considered. Emma's only surprize was that Jane Fairfax should accept those attentions and tolerate Mrs. Elton as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) seemed to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) walking with the Eltons, sitting with the Eltons, spending a day with the Eltons! This was astonishing! She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could not have believed it possible that the taste or the pride of Miss Fairfax could endure such society and friendship as the Vicarage had to offer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a riddle, quite a riddle!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). "To chuse to remain here month after month, under privations of every sort! And now to chuse the mortification of Mrs. Elton's notice and the penury of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) conversation, rather than return to the superior companions who have always loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with such real, generous affection."

<p/>Jane had come to Highbury professedly for three months; the Campbells were gone to Ireland for three months; but now the Campbells had promised their daughter to stay at least till Midsummer, and fresh invitations had arrived for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) to join them there. According to Miss Bates it all came from her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) Mrs. Dixon had written most pressingly. Would Jane but go, means were to be found, servants sent, friends contrived no travelling difficulty allowed to exist; but still she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had declined it!

<p/><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must have some motive, more powerful than appears, for refusing this invitation,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>was Emma's conclusion. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be under some sort of penance, inflicted either by the Campbells or herself. There is great fear, great caution, great resolution somewhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is not to be with the Dixons. The decree is issued by somebody. But why must she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) consent to be with the Eltons? Here is quite a separate puzzle.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) speaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wonder aloud on that part of the subject, before the few who knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) opinion of Mrs. Elton, Mrs. Weston ventured this apology for Jane.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>We cannot suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has any great enjoyment at the Vicarage, my dear Emma but it is better than being always at home. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt is a good creature, but, as a constant companion, must be very tiresome. We must consider what Miss Fairfax quits, before we condemn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) taste for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) goes to."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are right, Mrs. Weston,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley warmly, "Miss Fairfax is as capable as any of us of forming a just opinion of Mrs. Elton. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) have chosen with whom to associate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not have chosen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). But (with a reproachful smile at Emma) she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) receives attentions from Mrs. Elton, which nobody else pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)."

<p/>Emma felt that Mrs. Weston was giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) a momentary glance; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was herself struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) warmth. With a faint blush, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) presently replied,

<p/>"Such attentions as Mrs. Elton's, I should have imagined, would rather disgust than gratify Miss Fairfax. Mrs. Elton's invitations I should have imagined any thing but inviting."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should not wonder,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, "if Miss Fairfax were to have been drawn on beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own inclination, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) aunt's eagerness in accepting Mrs. Elton's civilities for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). Poor Miss Bates may very likely have committed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece and hurried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) into a greater appearance of intimacy than her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) own good sense would have dictated, in spite of the very natural wish of a little change."

<p/>Both felt rather anxious to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) speak again; and after a few minutes silence, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) said,

<p/>"Another thing must be taken into consideration too Mrs. Elton does not talk to Miss Fairfax as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). We all know the difference between the pronouns he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) or she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and thou, the plainest spoken amongst us; we all feel the influence of a something beyond common civility in our personal intercourse with each other a something more early implanted. We cannot give any body the disagreeable hints that we may have been very full of the hour before. We feel things differently. And besides the operation of this, as a general principle, you may be sure that Miss Fairfax awes Mrs. Elton by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) superiority both of mind and manner; and that, face to face, Mrs. Elton treats her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with all the respect which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has a claim to. Such a woman as Jane Fairfax probably never fell in Mrs. Elton's way before and no degree of vanity can prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acknowledging her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own comparative littleness in action, if not in consciousness."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I know how highly you think of Jane Fairfax,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. Little Henry was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, and a mixture of alarm and delicacy made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) irresolute what else to say.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) replied, <div class="bookquote">"any body may know how highly I think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"And yet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, beginning hastily and with an arch look, but soon stopping it was better, however, to know the worst at once she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hurried on "And yet, perhaps, you may hardly be aware yourself how highly it is. The extent of your admiration may take you by surprize some day or other."

<p/>Mr. Knightley was hard at work upon the lower buttons of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thick leather gaiters, and either the exertion of getting them together, or some other cause, brought the colour into his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) answered,

<p/>"Oh! are you there? But you are miserably behindhand. Mr. Cole gave me a hint of it six weeks ago."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) stopped. Emma felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) foot pressed by Mrs. Weston, and did not herself know what to think. In a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) went on

<p/>"That will never be, however, I can assure you. Miss Fairfax, I dare say, would not have me if I were to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and I am very sure I shall never ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)."

<p/>Emma returned her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's pressure with interest; and was pleased enough to exclaim,

<p/>"You are not vain, Mr. Knightley. I will say that for you."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed hardly to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was thoughtful and in a manner which shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not pleased, soon afterwards said,

<p/>"So you have been settling that I should marry Jane Fairfax?"

<p/>"No indeed I have not. You have scolded me too much for match-making, for me to presume to take such a liberty with you. What I said just now, meant nothing. One says those sort of things, of course, without any idea of a serious meaning. Oh! no, upon my word I have not the smallest wish for your marrying Jane Fairfax or Jane any body. You would not come in and sit with us in this comfortable way, if you were married."

<p/>Mr. Knightley was thoughtful again. The result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) reverie was, "No, Emma, I do not think the extent of my admiration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will ever take me by surprize. I never had a thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in that way, I assure you.<div class="bookquote">" And soon afterwards, " (<font color='red'><b>Jane Fairfax/Jane</b></font>)</div>Jane Fairfax is a very charming young woman but not even Jane Fairfax is perfect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has a fault. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) has not the open temper which a man would wish for in a wife.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma could not but rejoice to hear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had a fault. " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Well," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "and you soon silenced Mr. Cole, I suppose?"

<p/>"Yes, very soon. He (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) gave me a quiet hint; I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) was mistaken; he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) asked my pardon and said no more. Cole does not want to be wiser or wittier than his (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) neighbours."

<p/>"In that respect how unlike dear Mrs. Elton, who wants to be wiser and wittier than all the world! I wonder how she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) speaks of the Coles what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls them! How can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) find any appellation for them, deep enough in familiar vulgarity? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) calls you, Knightley what can she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) do for Mr. Cole? And so I am not to be surprized that Jane Fairfax accepts her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) civilities and consents to be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). Mrs. Weston, your argument weighs most with me. I can much more readily enter into the temptation of getting away from Miss Bates, than I can believe in the triumph of Miss Fairfax's mind over Mrs. Elton. I have no faith in Mrs. Elton's acknowledging herself the inferior in thought, word, or deed; or in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) being under any restraint beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own scanty rule of good-breeding. I cannot imagine that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be continually insulting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) visitor with praise, encouragement, and offers of service; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) will not be continually detailing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) magnificent intentions, from the procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) a permanent situation to the including her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in those delightful exploring parties which are to take place in the barouche-landau."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Jane Fairfax has feeling,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley/Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley "I do not accuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) of want of feeling. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) sensibilities, I suspect, are strong and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) temper excellent in its power of forbearance, patience, self-control; but it wants openness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is reserved, more reserved, I think, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) used to be And I love an open temper. No till Cole alluded to my supposed attachment, it had never entered my head. I saw Jane Fairfax and conversed with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), with admiration and pleasure always but with no thought beyond."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well, Mrs. Weston,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma triumphantly when he (<font color='blue'><b>Cole</b></font>) left them, "what do you say now to Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax?"

<p/>"Why, really, dear Emma, I say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is so very much occupied by the idea of not being in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), that I should not wonder if it were to end in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being so at last. Do not beat me."
