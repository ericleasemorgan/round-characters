<p/>The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end,
and Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings
necessarily attending it, and occasionally from some peevish
allusions of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother. As for the gentleman himself, _his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)_
feelings were chiefly expressed, not by embarrassment or
dejection, or by trying to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), but by stiffness of manner
and resentful silence. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) scarcely ever spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and the
assiduous attentions which he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had been so sensible of himself
were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose
civility in listening to him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was a seasonable relief to them all,
and especially to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend.

<p/>The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill-humour or
ill health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry
pride. Elizabeth had hoped that his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) resentment might shorten his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
visit, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan did not appear in the least affected by it.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was always to have gone on Saturday, and to Saturday he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) meant
to stay.

<p/>After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton to enquire if Mr.
Wickham were returned, and to lament over his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) absence from the
Netherfield ball. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) joined them on their entering the town, and
attended them to their aunt’s where his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) regret and vexation, and
the concern of everybody, was well talked over. To Elizabeth,
however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
absence _had_ been self-imposed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I found,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"as the time drew near that I had better not
meet Mr. Darcy; that to be in the same room, the same party with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) for so many hours together, might be more than I could bear,
and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) highly approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) forbearance, and they had leisure for a
full discussion of it, and for all the commendation which they
civilly bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer
walked back with them to Longbourn, and during the walk he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
particularly attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) accompanying them was a double
advantage; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt all the compliment it offered to herself, and
it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father and mother.

<p/>Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet;
it came from Netherfield. The envelope contained a sheet of
elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s
fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s countenance
change as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) read it, and saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dwelling intently on some
particular passages. Jane recollected herself soon, and putting
the letter away, tried to join with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) usual cheerfulness in the
general conversation; but Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the
subject which drew off her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attention even from Wickham; and no
sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) companion taken leave, than a glance from
Jane invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to follow her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) up stairs. When they had gained
their own room, Jane, taking out the letter, said:

<p/>"This is from Caroline Bingley; what it contains has surprised me
a good deal. The whole party have left Netherfield by this time,
and are on their way to town—and without any intention of coming
back again. You shall hear what she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) says."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the
information of their having just resolved to follow their brother
to town directly, and of their meaning to dine in Grosvenor
Street, where Mr. Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:
"I do not pretend to regret anything I shall leave in
Hertfordshire, except your society, my dearest friend; but we
will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many returns of that
delightful intercourse we have known, and in the meanwhile may
lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most
unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.<div class="bookquote">" To these
highflown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the
insensibility of distrust; and though the suddenness of their
removal surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw nothing in it really to lament; it
was not to be supposed that their absence from Netherfield would
prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as to the loss of their
society, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was persuaded that Jane must cease to regard it, in
the enjoyment of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is unlucky," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), after a short pause, "that you should
not be able to see your friends before they leave the country.
But may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which
Miss Bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is aware,
and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends
will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters? Mr.
Bingley will not be detained in London by them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into
Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you:"

 (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div><p/>"When my brother left us yesterday, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagined that the business
which took him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to London might be concluded in three or four
days; but as we are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time
convinced that when Charles gets to town he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will be in no hurry
to leave it again, we have determined on following him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thither,
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) may not be obliged to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) vacant hours in a
comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintances are already there for
the winter; I wish that I could hear that you, my dearest friend,
had any intention of making one of the crowd—but of that I
despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may
abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings, and
that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling
the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is evident by this,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>added Jane, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) comes back no more
this winter."

<p/>"It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
_should_."

<p/>"Why will you think so? It must be his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own doing. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
master. But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage
which particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darcy is impatient to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister; and, to confess the
truth, _we_ are scarcely less eager to meet her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) again. I really
do not think Georgiana Darcy has her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) equal for beauty, elegance,
and accomplishments; and the affection she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) inspires in Louisa and
myself is heightened into something still more interesting, from
the hope we dare entertain of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) being hereafter our sister. I
do not know whether I ever before mentioned to you my feelings on
this subject; but I will not leave the country without confiding
them, and I trust you will not esteem them unreasonable. My
brother admires her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) greatly already; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) will have frequent
opportunity now of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) on the most intimate footing; her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
relations all wish the connection as much as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own; and a
sister’s partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call
Charles most capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all
these circumstances to favour an attachment, and nothing to
prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest Jane, in indulging the hope of
an event which will secure the happiness of so many?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What do you think of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) finished it. "Is it not clear enough? Does it not
expressly declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to
be her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) sister; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) is perfectly convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother’s
indifference; and that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) suspects the nature of my feelings
for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) means (most kindly!) to put me on my guard? Can
there be any other opinion on the subject?"

<p/>"Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear
it?"

<p/>"Most willingly."

<p/>"You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
brother is in love with you, and wants him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to marry Miss Darcy.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) follows him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to town in hope of keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) there, and tries
to persuade you that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does not care about you.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) head.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen
you together can doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) affection. Miss Bingley, I am sure,
cannot. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is not such a simpleton. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) have seen half as
much love in Mr. Darcy for herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would have ordered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
wedding clothes. But the case is this: We are not rich enough or
grand enough for them; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is the more anxious to get Miss
Darcy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother, from the notion that when there has been
_one_ intermarriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may have less trouble in achieving a
second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I dare
say it would succeed, if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But,
my dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that because Miss
Bingley tells you her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is
in the smallest degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
took leave of you on Tuesday, or that it will be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) power to
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that, instead of being in love with you, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is very
much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend."

<p/>"If we thought alike of Miss Bingley," replied Jane, "your
representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know
the foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully
deceiving anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) is deceiving herself."

<p/>"That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea,
since you will not take comfort in mine. Believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) to be
deceived, by all means. You have now done your duty by her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), and
must fret no longer."

<p/>"But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in
accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to
marry elsewhere?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You must decide for yourself,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth; "and if, upon
mature deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
wife, I advise you by all means to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How can you talk so?"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, faintly smiling. "You must know
that though I should be exceedingly grieved at their
disapprobation, I could not hesitate."

<p/>"I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot
consider your situation with much compassion."

<p/>"But if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returns no more this winter, my choice will never be
required. A thousand things may arise in six months!"

<p/>The idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) returning no more Elizabeth treated with the
utmost contempt. It appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) merely the suggestion of
Caroline’s interested wishes, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not for a moment
suppose that those wishes, however openly or artfully spoken,
could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) represented to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister as forcibly as possible what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
felt on the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its
happy effect. Jane’s temper was not desponding, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was
gradually led to hope, though the diffidence of affection
sometimes overcame the hope, that Bingley would return to
Netherfield and answer every wish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) heart.

<p/>They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of
the family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s
conduct; but even this partial communication gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) a great
deal of concern, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that
the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting
so intimate together. After lamenting it, however, at some
length, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had the consolation that Mr. Bingley would be soon
down again and soon dining at Longbourn, and the conclusion of
all was the comfortable declaration, that though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been
invited only to a family dinner, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would take care to have two
full courses.
