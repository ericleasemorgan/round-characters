<p/>However small Elinor’s general dependence on Lucy’s veracity might be,
it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on serious reflection to suspect it in the
present case, where no temptation could be answerable to the folly of
inventing a falsehood of such a description. What Lucy had asserted to
be true, therefore, Elinor could not, dared not longer doubt; supported
as it was too on every side by such probabilities and proofs, and
contradicted by nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own wishes. Their opportunity of
acquaintance in the house of Mr. Pratt was a foundation for the rest,
at once indisputable and alarming; and Edward’s visit near Plymouth,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) melancholy state of mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dissatisfaction at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own prospects,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) uncertain behaviour towards herself, the intimate knowledge of the
Miss Steeles as to Norland and their family connections, which had
often surprised her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>), the picture, the letter, the ring, formed
altogether such a body of evidence, as overcame every fear of
condemning him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) unfairly, and established as a fact, which no partiality
could set aside, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ill-treatment of herself.—Her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) resentment of such
behaviour, her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) indignation at having been its dupe, for a short time
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) feel only for herself; but other ideas, other considerations,
soon arose. Had Edward been intentionally deceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>)? Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) feigned
a regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Steeles</b></font>) which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not feel? Was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) engagement to Lucy an
engagement of the heart? No; whatever it might once have been, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
could not believe it such at present. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection was all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not be deceived in that. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, sisters, Fanny, all had
been conscious of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) at Norland; it was not an illusion
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own vanity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) certainly loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>). What a softener of the heart
was this persuasion! How much could it not tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) to forgive! He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had
been blamable, highly blamable, in remaining at Norland after he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) first
felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) influence over him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be more than it ought to be. In that, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
could not be defended; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>), how much more had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
injured himself; if her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) case were pitiable, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was hopeless. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
imprudence had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) miserable for a while; but it seemed to have
deprived himself of all chance of ever being otherwise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) might in
time regain tranquillity; but _he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)_, what had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to look forward to?
Could he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever be tolerably happy with Lucy Steele; could he (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>), were his (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)
affection for herself out of the question, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) integrity, his (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)
delicacy, and well-informed mind, be satisfied with a wife like
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)—illiterate, artful, and selfish?

<p/>The youthful infatuation of nineteen would naturally blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) to every
thing but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty and good nature; but the four succeeding
years—years, which if rationally spent, give such improvement to the
understanding, must have opened his (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) defects of education,
while the same period of time, spent on her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) side in inferior society
and more frivolous pursuits, had perhaps robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) of that simplicity
which might once have given an interesting character to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) beauty.

<p/>If in the supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) seeking to marry herself, his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) difficulties
from his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) mother had seemed great, how much greater were they now likely
to be, when the object of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) engagement was undoubtedly inferior in
connections, and probably inferior in fortune to herself. These
difficulties, indeed, with a heart so alienated from Lucy, might not
press very hard upon his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) patience; but melancholy was the state of the
person by whom the expectation of family opposition and unkindness,
could be felt as a relief!

<p/>As these considerations occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in painful succession, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) wept
for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), more than for herself. Supported by the conviction of having
done nothing to merit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) present unhappiness, and consoled by the
belief that Edward had done nothing to forfeit her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) esteem, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) thought
she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could even now, under the first smart of the heavy blow, command
herself enough to guard every suspicion of the truth from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother
and sisters. And so well was she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) able to answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own expectations,
that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) joined them at dinner only two hours after she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had first
suffered the extinction of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) dearest hopes, no one would have
supposed from the appearance of the sisters, that Elinor was mourning
in secret over obstacles which must divide her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for ever from the object
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) love, and that Marianne was internally dwelling on the
perfections of a man, of whose whole heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt thoroughly
possessed, and whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected to see in every carriage which drove
near their house.

<p/>The necessity of concealing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother and Marianne, what had been
entrusted in confidence to herself, though it obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to unceasing
exertion, was no aggravation of Elinor’s distress. On the contrary it
was a relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), to be spared the communication of what would give
such affliction to them, and to be saved likewise from hearing that
condemnation of Edward, which would probably flow from the excess of
their partial affection for herself, and which was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt
equal to support.

<p/>From their counsel, or their conversation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could receive
no assistance, their tenderness and sorrow must add to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) distress,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) self-command would neither receive encouragement from their
example nor from their praise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was stronger alone, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own good
sense so well supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) firmness was as unshaken, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
appearance of cheerfulness as invariable, as with regrets so poignant
and so fresh, it was possible for them to be.

<p/>Much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had suffered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first conversation with Lucy on the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) soon felt an earnest wish of renewing it; and this for
more reasons than one. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted to hear many particulars of their
engagement repeated again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wanted more clearly to understand what
Lucy really felt for Edward, whether there were any sincerity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
declaration of tender regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) particularly wanted to
convince Lucy, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) readiness to enter on the matter again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
calmness in conversing on it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was no otherwise interested in
it than as a friend, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very much feared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) involuntary
agitation, in their morning discourse, must have left at least
doubtful. That Lucy was disposed to be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) appeared very
probable: it was plain that Edward had always spoken highly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>)
praise, not merely from Lucy’s assertion, but from her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) venturing to
trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) on so short a personal acquaintance, with a secret so
confessedly and evidently important. And even Sir John’s joking
intelligence must have had some weight. But indeed, while Elinor
remained so well assured within herself of being really beloved by
Edward, it required no other consideration of probabilities to make it
natural that Lucy should be jealous; and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was so, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) very
confidence was a proof. What other reason for the disclosure of the
affair could there be, but that Elinor might be informed by it of
Lucy’s superior claims on Edward, and be taught to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in future?
She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) had little difficulty in understanding thus much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) rival’s
intentions, and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was firmly resolved to act by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) as every
principle of honour and honesty directed, to combat her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own affection
for Edward and to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as little as possible; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could not deny
herself the comfort of endeavouring to convince Lucy that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) heart was
unwounded. And as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could now have nothing more painful to hear on
the subject than had already been told, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) did not mistrust her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own
ability of going through a repetition of particulars with composure.

<p/>But it was not immediately that an opportunity of doing so could be
commanded, though Lucy was as well disposed as herself to take
advantage of any that occurred; for the weather was not often fine
enough to allow of their joining in a walk, where they might most
easily separate themselves from the others; and though they met at
least every other evening either at the park or cottage, and chiefly at
the former, they could not be supposed to meet for the sake of
conversation. Such a thought would never enter either Sir John or Lady
Middleton’s head; and therefore very little leisure was ever given for
a general chat, and none at all for particular discourse. They met for
the sake of eating, drinking, and laughing together, playing at cards,
or consequences, or any other game that was sufficiently noisy.

<p/>One or two meetings of this kind had taken place, without affording
Elinor any chance of engaging Lucy in private, when Sir John called at
the cottage one morning, to beg, in the name of charity, that they
would all dine with Lady Middleton that day, as he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was obliged to
attend the club at Exeter, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) would otherwise be quite alone,
except her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) mother and the two Miss Steeles. Elinor, who foresaw a
fairer opening for the point she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had in view, in such a party as this
was likely to be, more at liberty among themselves under the tranquil
and well-bred direction of Lady Middleton than when her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) husband united
them together in one noisy purpose, immediately accepted the
invitation; Margaret, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) mother’s permission, was equally
compliant, and Marianne, though always unwilling to join any of their
parties, was persuaded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, who could not bear to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
seclude herself from any chance of amusement, to go likewise.

<p/>The young ladies went, and Lady Middleton was happily preserved from
the frightful solitude which had threatened her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>). The insipidity of the
meeting was exactly such as Elinor had expected; it produced not one
novelty of thought or expression, and nothing could be less interesting
than the whole of their discourse both in the dining parlour and
drawing room: to the latter, the children accompanied them, and while
they remained there, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was too well convinced of the impossibility of
engaging Lucy’s attention to attempt it. They quitted it only with the
removal of the tea-things. The card-table was then placed, and Elinor
began to wonder at herself for having ever entertained a hope of
finding time for conversation at the park. They all rose up in
preparation for a round game.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am glad,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton to Lucy, "you are not going to finish
poor little Annamaria’s basket this evening; for I am sure it must hurt
your eyes to work filigree by candlelight. And we will make the dear
little love some amends for her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) disappointment to-morrow, and then I
hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) will not much mind it."

<p/>This hint was enough, Lucy recollected herself instantly and replied,
"Indeed you are very much mistaken, Lady Middleton; I am only waiting
to know whether you can make your party without me, or I should have
been at my filigree already. I would not disappoint the little angel
for all the world: and if you want me at the card-table now, I am
resolved to finish the basket after supper."

<p/>"You are very good, I hope it won’t hurt your eyes—will you ring the
bell for some working candles? My poor little girl would be sadly
disappointed, I know, if the basket was not finished tomorrow, for
though I told her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) it certainly would not, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) depends upon
having it done."

<p/>Lucy directly drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) work table near her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) and reseated herself with an
alacrity and cheerfulness which seemed to infer that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) could taste no
greater delight than in making a filigree basket for a spoilt child.

<p/>Lady Middleton proposed a rubber of Casino to the others. No one made
any objection but Marianne, who with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) usual inattention to the forms
of general civility, exclaimed, "Your Ladyship will have the goodness
to excuse _me_—you know I detest cards. I shall go to the piano-forte;
I have not touched it since it was tuned." And without farther
ceremony, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) turned away and walked to the instrument.

<p/>Lady Middleton looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) thanked heaven that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)_ had never
made so rude a speech.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Marianne can never keep long from that instrument you know, ma’am,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, endeavouring to smooth away the offence; "and I do not
much wonder at it; for it is the very best toned piano-forte I ever
heard."

<p/>The remaining five were now to draw their cards.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, "if I should happen to cut out, I may be
of some use to Miss Lucy Steele, in rolling her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) papers for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>); and
there is so much still to be done to the basket, that it must be
impossible I think for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) labour singly, to finish it this evening. I
should like the work exceedingly, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) would allow me a share in it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed I shall be very much obliged to you for your help,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lucy</b></font>)</div>cried Lucy,
"for I find there is more to be done to it than I thought there was;
and it would be a shocking thing to disappoint dear Annamaria after
all."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! that would be terrible, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Steele</b></font>)</div>said Miss Steele. "Dear little
soul, how I do love her (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>)!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are very kind,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Middleton</b></font>)</div>said Lady Middleton to Elinor; "and as you really
like the work, perhaps you will be as well pleased not to cut in till
another rubber, or will you take your chance now?"

<p/>Elinor joyfully profited by the first of these proposals, and thus by a
little of that address which Marianne could never condescend to
practise, gained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own end, and pleased Lady Middleton at the same
time. Lucy made room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) with ready attention, and the two fair
rivals were thus seated side by side at the same table, and, with the
utmost harmony, engaged in forwarding the same work. The pianoforte at
which Marianne, wrapped up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own music and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own thoughts, had
by this time forgotten that any body was in the room besides herself,
was luckily so near them that Miss Dashwood now judged she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might
safely, under the shelter of its noise, introduce the interesting
subject, without any risk of being heard at the card-table.
