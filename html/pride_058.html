<p/>Instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend,
as Elizabeth half expected Mr. Bingley to do, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was able to
bring Darcy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to Longbourn before many days had passed
after Lady Catherine’s visit. The gentlemen arrived early; and,
before Mrs. Bennet had time to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) of their having seen his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
aunt, of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter sat in momentary dread, Bingley, who
wanted to be alone with Jane, proposed their all walking out. It
was agreed to. Mrs. Bennet was not in the habit of walking; Mary
could never spare time; but the remaining five set off together.
Bingley and Jane, however, soon allowed the others to outstrip
them. They lagged behind, while Elizabeth, Kitty, and Darcy were
to entertain each other. Very little was said by either; Kitty
was too much afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to talk; Elizabeth was secretly
forming a desperate resolution; and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) might be doing the
same.

<p/>They walked towards the Lucases, because Kitty wished to call
upon Maria; and as Elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a
general concern, when Kitty left them she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went boldly on with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
alone. Now was the moment for her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) resolution to be executed, and,
while her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) courage was high, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) immediately said:

<p/>"Mr. Darcy, I am a very selfish creature; and, for the sake of
giving relief to my own feelings, care not how much I may be
wounding yours. I can no longer help thanking you for your
unexampled kindness to my poor sister. Ever since I have known
it, I have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully
I feel it. Were it known to the rest of my family, I should not
have merely my own gratitude to express."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sorry, exceedingly sorry,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, in a tone of
surprise and emotion, "that you have ever been informed of what
may, in a mistaken light, have given you uneasiness. I did not
think Mrs. Gardiner was so little to be trusted."

<p/>"You must not blame my aunt. Lydia’s thoughtlessness first
betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter; and, of
course, I could not rest till I knew the particulars. Let me
thank you again and again, in the name of all my family, for that
generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble,
and bear so many mortifications, for the sake of discovering
them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If you _will_ thank me,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) replied, "let it be for yourself
alone. That the wish of giving happiness to you might add force
to the other inducements which led me on, I shall not attempt to
deny. But your _family_ owe me nothing. Much as I respect them, I
believe I thought only of _you_."

<p/>Elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word. After a short
pause, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) companion added, "You are too generous to trifle with
me. If your feelings are still what they were last April, tell me
so at once. _My_ affections and wishes are unchanged, but one
word from you will silence me on this subject for ever."

<p/>Elizabeth, feeling all the more than common awkwardness and
anxiety of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) situation, now forced herself to speak; and
immediately, though not very fluently, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) to understand
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sentiments had undergone so material a change, since the
period to which he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) alluded, as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) receive with gratitude
and pleasure his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) present assurances. The happiness which this
reply produced, was such as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) had probably never felt before;
and he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as
warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do. Had
Elizabeth been able to encounter his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eye, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have seen how
well the expression of heartfelt delight, diffused over his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) face,
became him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); but, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not look, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could listen, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of feelings, which, in proving of what importance she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
was to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), made his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affection every moment more valuable.

<p/>They walked on, without knowing in what direction. There was too
much to be thought, and felt, and said, for attention to any
other objects. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) soon learnt that they were indebted for their
present good understanding to the efforts of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) aunt, who _did_
call on him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) return through London, and there relate her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
journey to Longbourn, its motive, and the substance of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
conversation with Elizabeth; dwelling emphatically on every
expression of the latter which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship’s apprehension,
peculiarly denoted her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) perverseness and assurance; in the belief
that such a relation must assist her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) endeavours to obtain that
promise from her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) nephew which _she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)_ had refused to give. But,
unluckily for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ladyship, its effect had been exactly
contrariwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It taught me to hope,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>), "as I had scarcely ever allowed
myself to hope before. I knew enough of your disposition to be
certain that, had you been absolutely, irrevocably decided
against me, you would have acknowledged it to Lady Catherine,
frankly and openly."

<p/>Elizabeth coloured and laughed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, "Yes, you know
enough of my _frankness_ to believe me capable of _that_. After
abusing you so abominably to your face, I could have no scruple
in abusing you to all your relations."

<p/>"What did you say of me, that I did not deserve? For, though your
accusations were ill-founded, formed on mistaken premises, my
behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof. It
was unpardonable. I cannot think of it without abhorrence."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to
that evening,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth. "The conduct of neither, if
strictly examined, will be irreproachable; but since then, we
have both, I hope, improved in civility."

<p/>"I cannot be so easily reconciled to myself. The recollection of
what I then said, of my conduct, my manners, my expressions
during the whole of it, is now, and has been many months,
inexpressibly painful to me. Your reproof, so well applied, I
shall never forget: <div class="bookquote">‘had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike
manner.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Those were your words. You know not, you can scarcely
conceive, how they have tortured me;—though it was some time, I
confess, before I was reasonable enough to allow their justice."

<p/>"I was certainly very far from expecting them to make so strong
an impression. I had not the smallest idea of their being ever
felt in such a way."

<p/>"I can easily believe it. You thought me then devoid of every
proper feeling, I am sure you did. The turn of your countenance I
shall never forget, as you said that I could not have addressed
you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me."

<p/>"Oh! do not repeat what I then said. These recollections will not
do at all. I assure you that I have long been most heartily
ashamed of it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Darcy mentioned his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) letter. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Did it," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), "did it soon make
you think better of me? Did you, on reading it, give any credit
to its contents?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) explained what its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) had been, and how gradually
all her (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) former prejudices had been removed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I knew," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), "that what I wrote must give you pain, but it
was necessary. I hope you have destroyed the letter. There was
one part especially, the opening of it, which I should dread your
having the power of reading again. I can remember some
expressions which might justly make you hate me."

<p/>"The letter shall certainly be burnt, if you believe it essential
to the preservation of my regard; but, though we have both reason
to think my opinions not entirely unalterable, they are not, I
hope, quite so easily changed as that implies."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"When I wrote that letter,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, "I believed myself
perfectly calm and cool, but I am since convinced that it was
written in a dreadful bitterness of spirit."

<p/>"The letter, perhaps, began in bitterness, but it did not end so.
The adieu is charity itself. But think no more of the letter. The
feelings of the person who wrote, and the person who received it,
are now so widely different from what they were then, that every
unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten. You
must learn some of my philosophy. Think only of the past as its
remembrance gives you pleasure."

<p/>"I cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind. _Your_
retrospections must be so totally void of reproach, that the
contentment arising from them is not of philosophy, but, what is
much better, of innocence. But with _me_, it is not so. Painful
recollections will intrude which cannot, which ought not, to be
repelled. I have been a selfish being all my life, in practice,
though not in principle. As a child I was taught what was
_right_, but I was not taught to correct my temper. I was given
good principles, but left to follow them in pride and conceit.
Unfortunately an only son (for many years an only _child_), I was
spoilt by my parents, who, though good themselves (my father,
particularly, all that was benevolent and amiable), allowed,
encouraged, almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing; to
care for none beyond my own family circle; to think meanly of all
the rest of the world; to _wish_ at least to think meanly of
their sense and worth compared with my own. Such I was, from
eight to eight and twenty; and such I might still have been but
for you, dearest, loveliest Elizabeth! What do I not owe you! You
taught me a lesson, hard indeed at first, but most advantageous.
By you, I was properly humbled. I came to you without a doubt of
my reception. You showed me how insufficient were all my
pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased."

<p/>"Had you then persuaded yourself that I should?"

<p/>"Indeed I had. What will you think of my vanity? I believed you
to be wishing, expecting my addresses."

<p/>"My manners must have been in fault, but not intentionally, I
assure you. I never meant to deceive you, but my spirits might
often lead me wrong. How you must have hated me after _that_
evening?"

<p/>"Hate you! I was angry perhaps at first, but my anger soon began
to take a proper direction."

<p/>"I am almost afraid of asking what you thought of me, when we met
at Pemberley. You blamed me for coming?"

<p/>"No indeed; I felt nothing but surprise."

<p/>"Your surprise could not be greater than _mine_ in being noticed
by you. My conscience told me that I deserved no extraordinary
politeness, and I confess that I did not expect to receive _more_
than my due."

<p/>"My object _then_,<div class="bookquote">" replied Darcy, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was to show you, by every
civility in my power, that I was not so mean as to resent the
past; and I hoped to obtain your forgiveness, to lessen your ill
opinion, by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended
to. How soon any other wishes introduced themselves I can hardly
tell, but I believe in about half an hour after I had seen you."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) then told her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of Georgiana’s delight in her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) acquaintance, and
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disappointment at its sudden interruption; which naturally
leading to the cause of that interruption, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) soon learnt that
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) resolution of following her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from Derbyshire in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sister had been formed before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) quitted the inn, and that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other
struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) gratitude again, but it was too painful a
subject to each, to be dwelt on farther.

<p/>After walking several miles in a leisurely manner, and too busy
to know anything about it, they found at last, on examining their
watches, that it was time to be at home.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What could become of Mr. Bingley and Jane!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was a wonder which
introduced the discussion of _their_ affairs. Darcy was delighted
with their engagement; his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) the earliest
information of it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must ask whether you were surprised?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth.

<p/>"Not at all. When I went away, I felt that it would soon happen."

<p/>"That is to say, you had given your permission. I guessed as
much.<div class="bookquote">" And though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) exclaimed at the term, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found that it had
been pretty much the case.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>On the evening before my going to London," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), "I made a
confession to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), which I believe I ought to have made long ago.
I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of all that had occurred to make my former
interference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) affairs absurd and impertinent. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) surprise
was great. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had never had the slightest suspicion. I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
moreover, that I believed myself mistaken in supposing, as I had
done, that your sister was indifferent to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); and as I could
easily perceive that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was unabated, I felt
no doubt of their happiness together.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could not help smiling at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) easy manner of directing
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Did you speak from your own observation," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "when you
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that my sister loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), or merely from my information
last spring?"

<p/>"From the former. I had narrowly observed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) during the two
visits which I had lately made here; and I was convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
affection."

<p/>"And your assurance of it, I suppose, carried immediate
conviction to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/>"It did. Bingley is most unaffectedly modest. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) diffidence had
prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) depending on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own judgment in so anxious a case,
but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) reliance on mine made every thing easy. I was obliged to
confess one thing, which for a time, and not unjustly, offended
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had
been in town three months last winter, that I had known it, and
purposely kept it from him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was angry. But his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) anger, I am
persuaded, lasted no longer than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) remained in any doubt of your
sister’s sentiments. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has heartily forgiven me now."

<p/>Elizabeth longed to observe that Mr. Bingley had been a most
delightful friend; so easily guided that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) worth was
invaluable; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) checked herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had
yet to learn to be laughed at, and it was rather too early to
begin. In anticipating the happiness of Bingley, which of course
was to be inferior only to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) continued the conversation
till they reached the house. In the hall they parted.
