<p/>The very day of Mr. Elton’s going to London produced a fresh occasion
for Emma’s services towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. Harriet had been at Hartfield,
as usual, soon after breakfast; and, after a time, had gone home to
return again to dinner: she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returned, and sooner than had been talked
of, and with an agitated, hurried look, announcing something
extraordinary to have happened which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was longing to tell. Half a
minute brought it all out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had heard, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got back to
Mrs. Goddard’s, that Mr. Martin had been there an hour before, and
finding she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not at home, nor particularly expected, had left a
little parcel for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sisters, and gone away; and on
opening this parcel, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had actually found, besides the two songs
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had lent Elizabeth to copy, a letter to herself; and this
letter was from him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), from Mr. Martin, and contained a direct proposal
of marriage. "Who could have thought it? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was so surprized she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did
not know what to do. Yes, quite a proposal of marriage; and a very good
letter, at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought so. And he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wrote as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
very much—but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not know—and so, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was come as fast as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could to ask Miss Woodhouse what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should do.—<div class="bookquote">" Emma was half-ashamed
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend for seeming so pleased and so doubtful.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Upon my word," she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, "the young man is determined not to lose any
thing for want of asking. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will connect himself well if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can."

<p/>"Will you read the letter?<div class="bookquote">" cried Harriet. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Pray do. II’d rather you
would."

<p/>Emma was not sorry to be pressed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) read, and was surprized. The
style of the letter was much above her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) expectation. There were not
merely no grammatical errors, but as a composition it would not have
disgraced a gentleman; the language, though plain, was strong and
unaffected, and the sentiments it conveyed very much to the credit of
the writer. It was short, but expressed good sense, warm attachment,
liberality, propriety, even delicacy of feeling. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) paused over it,
while Harriet stood anxiously watching for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion, with a <div class="bookquote">"Well,
well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>and was at last forced to add, "Is it a good letter? or is it
too short?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, indeed, a very good letter,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma rather slowly—"so good
a letter, Harriet, that every thing considered, I think one of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>)
sisters must have helped him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>). I can hardly imagine the young man whom I
saw talking with you the other day could express himself so well, if
left quite to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own powers, and yet it is not the style of a woman;
no, certainly, it is too strong and concise; not diffuse enough for a
woman. No doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a sensible man, and I suppose may have a natural
talent for—thinks strongly and clearly—and when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) takes a pen in hand,
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thoughts naturally find proper words. It is so with some men. Yes,
I understand the sort of mind. Vigorous, decided, with sentiments to a
certain point, not coarse. A better written letter, Harriet (returning
it,) than I had expected."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>the Harriet</b></font>)</div>said the still waiting Harriet;—"well—and—and what shall I do?"

<p/>"What shall you do! In what respect? Do you mean with regard to this
letter?"

<p/>"Yes."

<p/>"But what are you in doubt of? You must answer it of course—and
speedily."

<p/>"Yes. But what shall I say? Dear Miss Woodhouse, do advise me."

<p/>"Oh no, no! the letter had much better be all your own. You will
express yourself very properly, I am sure. There is no danger of your
not being intelligible, which is the first thing. Your meaning must be
unequivocal; no doubts or demurs: and such expressions of gratitude and
concern for the pain you are inflicting as propriety requires, will
present themselves unbidden to your mind, I am persuaded. You need
not be prompted to write with the appearance of sorrow for his (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>)
disappointment."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You think I ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>) then,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, looking down.

<p/>"Ought to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Your</b></font>)! My dear Harriet, what do you mean? Are you in any
doubt as to that? I thought—but I beg your pardon, perhaps I have been
under a mistake. I certainly have been misunderstanding you, if you
feel in doubt as to the purport of your answer. I had imagined you
were consulting me only as to the wording of it."

<p/>Harriet was silent. With a little reserve of manner, Emma continued:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You mean to return a favourable answer, I collect."

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, I do not; that is, I do not mean—What shall I do? What would you
advise me to do? Pray, dear Miss Woodhouse, tell me what I ought to
do."

<p/>"I shall not give you any advice, Harriet. I will have nothing to do
with it. This is a point which you must settle with your feelings."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I had no notion that he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) liked me so very much,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet,
contemplating the letter. For a little while Emma persevered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)
silence; but beginning to apprehend the bewitching flattery of that
letter might be too powerful, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought it best to say,

<p/>"I lay it down as a general rule, Harriet, that if a woman doubts as
to whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should accept a man or not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) certainly ought to
refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). If she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) can hesitate as to <div class="bookquote">‘Yes,’  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) ought to say <div class="bookquote">‘No’
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>directly. It is not a state to be safely entered into with doubtful
feelings, with half a heart. I thought it my duty as a friend, and
older than yourself, to say thus much to you. But do not imagine that I
want to influence you."

<p/>"Oh! no, I am sure you are a great deal too kind to—but if you would
just advise me what I had best do—No, no, I do not mean that—As you
say, one’s mind ought to be quite made up—One should not be
hesitating—It is a very serious thing.—It will be safer to say <div class="bookquote">‘No,’
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>perhaps.—Do you think I had better say <div class="bookquote">‘No?’ (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not for the world,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, smiling graciously, "would I advise you
either way. You must be the best judge of your own happiness. If you
prefer Mr. Martin to every other person; if you think him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) the most
agreeable man you have ever been in company with, why should you
hesitate? You blush, Harriet.—Does any body else occur to you at this
moment under such a definition? Harriet, Harriet, do not deceive
yourself; do not be run away with by gratitude and compassion. At this
moment whom are you thinking of?"

<p/>The symptoms were favourable.—Instead of answering, Harriet turned away
confused, and stood thoughtfully by the fire; and though the letter was
still in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand, it was now mechanically twisted about without
regard. Emma waited the result with impatience, but not without strong
hopes. At last, with some hesitation, Harriet said—

<p/>"Miss Woodhouse, as you will not give me your opinion, I must do as
well as I can by myself; and I have now quite determined, and really
almost made up my mind—to refuse Mr. Martin. Do you think I am right?"

<p/>"Perfectly, perfectly right, my dearest Harriet; you are doing just
what you ought. While you were at all in suspense I kept my feelings to
myself, but now that you are so completely decided I have no hesitation
in approving. Dear Harriet, I give myself joy of this. It would have
grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the
consequence of your marrying Mr. Martin. While you were in the smallest
degree wavering, I said nothing about it, because I would not
influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. I could
not have visited Mrs. Robert Martin, of Abbey-Mill Farm. Now I am
secure of you for ever.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Harriet had not surmised her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own danger, but the idea of it struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
forcibly.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You could not have visited me!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cried, looking aghast. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, to be
sure you could not; but I never thought of that before. That would have
been too dreadful!—What an escape!—Dear Miss Woodhouse, I would not
give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any
thing in the world."

<p/>"Indeed, Harriet, it would have been a severe pang to lose you; but it
must have been. You would have thrown yourself out of all good society.
I must have given you up."

<p/>"Dear me!—How should I ever have borne it! It would have killed me
never to come to Hartfield any more!"

<p/>"Dear affectionate creature!—You banished to Abbey-Mill Farm!—You
confined to the society of the illiterate and vulgar all your life! I
wonder how the young man could have the assurance to ask it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must
have a pretty good opinion of himself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not think he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is conceited either, in general,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)
conscience opposing such censure; "at least, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is very good natured,
and I shall always feel much obliged to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and have a great regard
for—but that is quite a different thing from—and you know, though he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
may like me, it does not follow that I should—and certainly I must
confess that since my visiting here I have seen people—and if one comes
to compare them, person and manners, there is no comparison at all,
one is so very handsome and agreeable. However, I do really think Mr.
Martin a very amiable young man, and have a great opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and
his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) being so much attached to me—and his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) writing such a letter—but as
to leaving you, it is what I would not do upon any consideration."

<p/>"Thank you, thank you, my own sweet little friend. We will not be
parted. A woman is not to marry a man merely because she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) is asked, or
because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), and can write a tolerable letter."

<p/>"Oh no;—and it is but a short letter too."

<p/>Emma felt the bad taste of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend, but let it pass with a "very
true; and it would be a small consolation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), for the clownish
manner which might be offending her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) every hour of the day, to know that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) husband could write a good letter."

<p/>"Oh! yes, very. Nobody cares for a letter; the thing is, to be always
happy with pleasant companions. I am quite determined to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>).
But how shall I do? What shall I say?"

<p/>Emma assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) there would be no difficulty in the answer, and
advised its being written directly, which was agreed to, in the hope of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) assistance; and though Emma continued to protest against any
assistance being wanted, it was in fact given in the formation of every
sentence. The looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) letter again, in replying to it, had
such a softening tendency, that it was particularly necessary to brace
her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) up with a few decisive expressions; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so very much
concerned at the idea of making him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) unhappy, and thought so much of
what his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother and sisters would think and say, and was so anxious
that they should not fancy her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ungrateful, that Emma believed if the
young man had come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) way at that moment, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have been
accepted after all.

<p/>This letter, however, was written, and sealed, and sent. The business
was finished, and Harriet safe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was rather low all the evening, but
Emma could allow for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) amiable regrets, and sometimes relieved them
by speaking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own affection, sometimes by bringing forward the
idea of Mr. Elton.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall never be invited to Abbey-Mill again,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was said in rather a
sorrowful tone.

<p/>"Nor, if you were, could I ever bear to part with you, my Harriet. You
are a great deal too necessary at Hartfield to be spared to
Abbey-Mill."

<p/>"And I am sure I should never want to go there; for I am never happy
but at Hartfield."

<p/>Some time afterwards it was, "I think Mrs. Goddard would be very much
surprized if she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) knew what had happened. I am sure Miss Nash would—for
Miss Nash thinks her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) own sister very well married, and it is only a
linen-draper."

<p/>"One should be sorry to see greater pride or refinement in the teacher
of a school, Harriet. I dare say Miss Nash would envy you such an
opportunity as this of being married. Even this conquest would appear
valuable in her (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>) eyes. As to any thing superior for you, I suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Nash</b></font>)
is quite in the dark. The attentions of a certain person can hardly be
among the tittle-tattle of Highbury yet. Hitherto I fancy you and I are
the only people to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>draper</b></font>) looks and manners have explained
themselves."

<p/>Harriet blushed and smiled, and said something about wondering that
people should like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) so much. The idea of Mr. Elton was certainly
cheering; but still, after a time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was tender-hearted again towards
the rejected Mr. Martin.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has got my letter,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) softly. "I wonder what they are
all doing—whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sisters know—if he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) is unhappy, they will be
unhappy too. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) will not mind it so very much."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Let us think of those among our absent friends who are more cheerfully
employed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma. "At this moment, perhaps, Mr. Elton is shewing
your picture to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) mother and sisters, telling how much more beautiful
is the original, and after being asked for it five or six times,
allowing them to hear your name, your own dear name."

<p/>"My picture!—But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has left my picture in Bond-street."

<p/>"Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) so!—Then I know nothing of Mr. Elton. No, my dear little modest
Harriet, depend upon it the picture will not be in Bond-street till
just before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) mounts his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) horse to-morrow. It is his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) companion all this
evening, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) solace, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) delight. It opens his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) designs to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) family,
it introduces you among them, it diffuses through the party those
pleasantest feelings of our nature, eager curiosity and warm
prepossession. How cheerful, how animated, how suspicious, how busy
their imaginations all are!"

<p/>Harriet smiled again, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) smiles grew stronger.
