<p/>Time passed on. A few more to-morrows, and the party from London would be arriving. It was an alarming change; and Emma was thinking of it one morning, as what must bring a great deal to agitate and grieve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), when Mr. Knightley came in, and distressing thoughts were put by. After the first chat of pleasure he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was silent; and then, in a graver tone, began with,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have something to tell you, Emma; some news."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Good or bad?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), quickly, looking up in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) face.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not know which it ought to be called."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! good I am sure.—I see it in your countenance. You are trying not to smile."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), composing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) features, "I am very much afraid, my dear Emma, that you will not smile when you hear it."

<p/>"Indeed! but why so?—I can hardly imagine that any thing which pleases or amuses you, should not please and amuse me too."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is one subject,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) replied, "I hope but one, on which we do not think alike.<div class="bookquote">" He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) paused a moment, again smiling, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes fixed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Does nothing occur to you?—Do not you recollect?—Harriet Smith.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cheeks flushed at the name, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) felt afraid of something, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew not what.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Have you heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) yourself this morning?<div class="bookquote">" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>You have, I believe, and know the whole."

<p/>"No, I have not; I know nothing; pray tell me."

<p/>"You are prepared for the worst, I see—and very bad it is. Harriet Smith marries Robert Martin."

<p/>Emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, in eager gaze, said, "No, this is impossible!<div class="bookquote">" but her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips were closed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>It is so, indeed," continued Mr. Knightley; "I have it from Robert Martin himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) left me not half an hour ago.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was still looking at him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) with the most speaking amazement.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>You like it, my Emma, as little as I feared.—I wish our opinions were the same. But in time they will. Time, you may be sure, will make one or the other of us think differently; and, in the meanwhile, we need not talk much on the subject."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You mistake me, you quite mistake me,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied, exerting herself. "It is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but I cannot believe it. It seems an impossibility!—You cannot mean to say, that Harriet Smith has accepted Robert Martin. You cannot mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has even proposed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) again—yet. You only mean, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) intends it."

<p/>"I mean that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) has done it,<div class="bookquote">" answered Mr. Knightley, with smiling but determined decision, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and been accepted."

<p/>"Good God!" she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cried.—<div class="bookquote">"Well!" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>—Then having recourse to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) face, and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must be expressing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) added, "Well, now tell me every thing; make this intelligible to me. How, where, when?—Let me know it all. I never was more surprized—but it does not make me unhappy, I assure you.—How—how has it been possible?"

<p/>"It is a very simple story. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) went to town on business three days ago, and I got him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) to take charge of some papers which I was wanting to send to John.—He (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) delivered these papers to John, at his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) chambers, and was asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to join their party the same evening to Astley's. They were going to take the two eldest boys to Astley's. The party was to be our brother and sister, Henry, John—and Miss Smith. My friend Robert could not resist. They called for him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) in their way; were all extremely amused; and my brother asked him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to dine with them the next day—which he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did—and in the course of that visit (as I understand) he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) found an opportunity of speaking to Harriet; and certainly did not speak in vain.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) made him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), by her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) acceptance, as happy even as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is deserving. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came down by yesterday's coach, and was with me this morning immediately after breakfast, to report his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) proceedings, first on my affairs, and then on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own. This is all that I can relate of the how, where, and when. Your friend Harriet will make a much longer history when you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>).—She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) will give you all the minute particulars, which only woman's language can make interesting.—In our communications we deal only in the great.—However, I must say, that Robert Martin's heart seemed for him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), and to me, very overflowing; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) did mention, without its being much to the purpose, that on quitting their box at Astley's, my brother took charge of Mrs. John Knightley and little John, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) followed with Miss Smith and Henry; and that at one time they were in such a crowd, as to make Miss Smith rather uneasy."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stopped.—Emma dared not attempt any immediate reply. To speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sure would be to betray a most unreasonable degree of happiness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must wait a moment, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would think her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mad. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) silence disturbed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>); and after observing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) a little while, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) added,

<p/>"Emma, my love, you said that this circumstance would not now make you unhappy; but I am afraid it gives you more pain than you expected. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) situation is an evil—but you must consider it as what satisfies your friend; and I will answer for your thinking better and better of him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) as you know him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) more. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) good sense and good principles would delight you.—As far as the man is concerned, you could not wish your friend in better hands. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) rank in society I would alter if I could, which is saying a great deal I assure you, Emma.—You laugh at me about William Larkins; but I could quite as ill spare Robert Martin."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly—she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did—cheerfully answering,

<p/>"You need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. I think Harriet is doing extremely well. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) connexions may be worse than his (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). In respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. I have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. You cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared I was!—for I had reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) very lately more determined against him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), much more, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was before."

<p/>"You ought to know your friend best," replied Mr. Knightley; "but I should say she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was a good-tempered, soft-hearted girl, not likely to be very, very determined against any young man who told her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)."

<p/>Emma could not help laughing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered, "Upon my word, I believe you know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quite as well as I do.—But, Mr. Knightley, are you perfectly sure that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) has absolutely and downright accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I could suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might in time—but can she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) already?—Did not you misunderstand him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?—You were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)?—It was not Harriet's hand that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The contrast between the countenance and air of Mr. Knightley and Robert Martin was, at this moment, so strong to Emma's feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on Harriet's side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>No, I hope I know better than to think of Robert Martin," that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. It could not be otherwise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do you dare say this?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>cried Mr. Knightley. "Do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know what a man is talking of?—What do you deserve?"

<p/>"Oh! I always deserve the best treatment, because I never put up with any other; and, therefore, you must give me a plain, direct answer. Are you quite sure that you understand the terms on which Mr. Martin and Harriet now are?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am quite sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) replied, speaking very distinctly, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) told me she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>); and that there was no obscurity, nothing doubtful, in the words he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) used; and I think I can give you a proof that it must be so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked my opinion as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was now to do. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) knew of no one but Mrs. Goddard to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) could apply for information of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) relations or friends. Could I mention any thing more fit to be done, than to go to Mrs. Goddard? I assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) that I could not. Then, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) said, he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) would endeavour to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) in the course of this day."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am perfectly satisfied,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, "and most sincerely wish them happy."

<p/>"You are materially changed since we talked on this subject before."

<p/>"I hope so—for at that time I was a fool."

<p/>"And I am changed also; for I am now very willing to grant you all Harriet's good qualities. I have taken some pains for your sake, and for Robert Martin's sake, (whom I have always had reason to believe as much in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as ever,) to get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). I have often talked to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) a good deal. You must have seen that I did. Sometimes, indeed, I have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor Martin's cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, I am convinced of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in the affections and utility of domestic life.—Much of this, I have no doubt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) may thank you for."

<p/>"Me!" cried Emma, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) head.—"Ah! poor Harriet!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) checked herself, however, and submitted quietly to a little more praise than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) deserved.

<p/>Their conversation was soon afterwards closed by the entrance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was not sorry. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wanted to be alone. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind was in a state of flutter and wonder, which made it impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to be collected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was in dancing, singing, exclaiming spirits; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had moved about, and talked to herself, and laughed and reflected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be fit for nothing rational.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's business was to announce James's being gone out to put the horses to, preparatory to their now daily drive to Randalls; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had, therefore, an immediate excuse for disappearing.

<p/>The joy, the gratitude, the exquisite delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) sensations may be imagined. The sole grievance and alloy thus removed in the prospect of Harriet's welfare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was really in danger of becoming too happy for security.—What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to wish for? Nothing, but to grow more worthy of him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>), whose intentions and judgment had been ever so superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own. Nothing, but that the lessons of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) past folly might teach her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) humility and circumspection in future.

<p/>Serious she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was, very serious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thankfulness, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must laugh at such a close! Such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! Such a heart—such a Harriet!

<p/>Now there would be pleasure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) returning—Every thing would be a pleasure. It would be a great pleasure to know Robert Martin.

<p/>High in the rank of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from Mr. Knightley would soon be over. The disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to practise, might soon be over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could now look forward to giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) that full and perfect confidence which her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.

<p/>In the gayest and happiest spirits she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) set forward with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father; not always listening, but always agreeing to what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said; and, whether in speech or silence, conniving at the comfortable persuasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being obliged to go to Randalls every day, or poor Mrs. Weston would be disappointed.

<p/>They arrived.—Mrs. Weston was alone in the drawing-room:—but hardly had they been told of the baby, and Mr. Woodhouse received the thanks for coming, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) asked for, when a glimpse was caught through the blind, of two figures passing near the window.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is Frank and Miss Fairfax,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston. "I was just going to tell you of our agreeable surprize in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arrive this morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) stays till to-morrow, and Miss Fairfax has been persuaded to spend the day with us.—They are coming in, I hope."

<p/>In half a minute they were in the room. Emma was extremely glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>)—but there was a degree of confusion—a number of embarrassing recollections on each side. They met readily and smiling, but with a consciousness which at first allowed little to be said; and having all sat down again, there was for some time such a blank in the circle, that Emma began to doubt whether the wish now indulged, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had long felt, of seeing Frank Churchill once more, and of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with Jane, would yield its proportion of pleasure. When Mr. Weston joined the party, however, and when the baby was fetched, there was no longer a want of subject or animation—or of courage and opportunity for Frank Churchill to draw near her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and say,

<p/>"I have to thank you, Miss Woodhouse, for a very kind forgiving message in one of Mrs. Weston's letters. I hope time has not made you less willing to pardon. I hope you do not retract what you then said."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>cried Emma, most happy to begin, "not in the least. I am particularly glad to see and shake hands with you—and to give you joy in person.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thanked her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gratitude and happiness.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looking well?" said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), turning his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) eyes towards Jane. "Better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ever used to do?—You see how my father and Mrs. Weston doat upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)."

<p/>But his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) spirits were soon rising again, and with laughing eyes, after mentioning the expected return of the Campbells, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) named the name of Dixon.—Emma blushed, and forbade its being pronounced in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hearing.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can never think of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried, <div class="bookquote">"without extreme shame."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"The shame,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered, "is all mine, or ought to be. But is it possible that you had no suspicion?—I mean of late. Early, I know, you had none."

<p/>"I never had the smallest, I assure you."

<p/>"That appears quite wonderful. I was once very near—and I wish I had—it would have been better. But though I was always doing wrong things, they were very bad wrong things, and such as did me no service.—It would have been a much better transgression had I broken the bond of secrecy and told you every thing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is not now worth a regret,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/>"I have some hope," resumed he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), "of my uncle's being persuaded to pay a visit at Randalls; he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) wants to be introduced to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). When the Campbells are returned, we shall meet them in London, and continue there, I trust, till we may carry her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) northward.—But now, I am at such a distance from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)—is not it hard, Miss Woodhouse?—Till this morning, we have not once met since the day of reconciliation. Do not you pity me?"

<p/>Emma spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) pity so very kindly, that with a sudden accession of gay thought, he (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) cried,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah! by the bye,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>then sinking his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) voice, and looking demure for the moment—"I hope Mr. Knightley is well?" He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) paused.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) coloured and laughed.—"I know you saw my letter, and think you may remember my wish in your favour. Let me return your congratulations.—I assure you that I have heard the news with the warmest interest and satisfaction.—He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is a man whom I cannot presume to praise."

<p/>Emma was delighted, and only wanted him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) to go on in the same style; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind was the next moment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own concerns and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own Jane, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) next words were,

<p/>"Did you ever see such a skin?—such smoothness! such delicacy!—and yet without being actually fair.—One cannot call her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) fair. It is a most uncommon complexion, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) dark eye-lashes and hair—a most distinguishing complexion! So peculiarly the lady in it.—Just colour enough for beauty."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have always admired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) complexion,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma, archly; "but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) for being so pale?—When we first began to talk of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).—Have you quite forgotten?"

<p/>"Oh! no—what an impudent dog I was!—How could I dare—"

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) laughed so heartily at the recollection, that Emma could not help saying,

<p/>"I do suspect that in the midst of your perplexities at that time, you had very great amusement in tricking us all.—I am sure you had.—I am sure it was a consolation to you."

<p/>"Oh! no, no, no—how can you suspect me of such a thing? I was the most miserable wretch!"

<p/>"Not quite so miserable as to be insensible to mirth. I am sure it was a source of high entertainment to you, to feel that you were taking us all in.—Perhaps I am the readier to suspect, because, to tell you the truth, I think it might have been some amusement to myself in the same situation. I think there is a little likeness between us.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) bowed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>If not in our dispositions," she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) presently added, with a look of true sensibility, "there is a likeness in our destiny; the destiny which bids fair to connect us with two characters so much superior to our own."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"True, true,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) answered, warmly. "No, not true on your side. You can have no superior, but most true on mine.—She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is a complete angel. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) an angel in every gesture? Observe the turn of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) throat. Observe her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is looking up at my father.—You will be glad to hear (inclining his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) head, and whispering seriously) that my uncle means to give her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) all my aunt's jewels. They are to be new set. I am resolved to have some in an ornament for the head. Will not it be beautiful in her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) dark hair?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very beautiful, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spoke so kindly, that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) gratefully burst out,

<p/>"How delighted I am to see you again! and to see you in such excellent looks!—I would not have missed this meeting for the world. I should certainly have called at Hartfield, had you failed to come."

<p/>The others had been talking of the child, Mrs. Weston giving an account of a little alarm she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been under, the evening before, from the infant's appearing not quite well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been foolish, but it had alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been within half a minute of sending for Mr. Perry. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) ought to be ashamed, but Mr. Weston had been almost as uneasy as herself.—In ten minutes, however, the child had been perfectly well again. This was her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) history; and particularly interesting it was to Mr. Woodhouse, who commended her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very much for thinking of sending for Perry, and only regretted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not done it. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should always send for Perry, if the child appeared in the slightest degree disordered, were it only for a moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be too soon alarmed, nor send for Perry too often. It was a pity, perhaps, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had not come last night; for, though the child seemed well now, very well considering, it would probably have been better if Perry had seen it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Frank Churchill caught the name.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Perry/Mr. Perry</b></font>)</div>Perry!" said he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to Emma, and trying, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) spoke, to catch Miss Fairfax's eye. "My friend Mr. Perry! What are they saying about Mr. Perry?—Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) been here this morning?—And how does he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) travel now?—Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma soon recollected, and understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>); and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined in the laugh, it was evident from Jane's countenance that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) too was really hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), though trying to seem deaf.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such an extraordinary dream of mine!<div class="bookquote">" he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) cried. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I can never think of it without laughing.—She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hears us, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) hears us, Miss Woodhouse. I see it in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cheek, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) smile, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) vain attempt to frown. Look at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). Do not you see that, at this instant, the very passage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own letter, which sent me the report, is passing under her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eye—that the whole blunder is spread before her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)—that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can attend to nothing else, though pretending to listen to the others?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane was forced to smile completely, for a moment; and the smile partly remained as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) turned towards him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>), and said in a conscious, low, yet steady voice,

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>How you can bear such recollections, is astonishing to me!—They will sometimes obtrude—but how you can court them!"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) had a great deal to say in return, and very entertainingly; but Emma's feelings were chiefly with Jane, in the argument; and on leaving Randalls, and falling naturally into a comparison of the two men, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt, that pleased as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had been to see Frank Churchill, and really regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did with friendship, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never been more sensible of Mr. Knightley's high superiority of character. The happiness of this most happy day, received its completion, in the animated contemplation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) worth which this comparison produced.
