<p/><div class="bookquote">"What a pity it is, Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "that Edward should have no
taste for drawing."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No taste for drawing!"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "why should you think so? He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
does not draw himself, indeed, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has great pleasure in seeing the
performances of other people, and I assure you he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is by no means
deficient in natural taste, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has not had opportunities of
improving it. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) ever been in the way of learning, I think he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would
have drawn very well. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) distrusts his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own judgment in such matters so
much, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is always unwilling to give his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on any picture;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) has an innate propriety and simplicity of taste, which in
general direct him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) perfectly right."

<p/>Marianne was afraid of offending, and said no more on the subject; but
the kind of approbation which Elinor described as excited in him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) by the
drawings of other people, was very far from that rapturous delight,
which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion, could alone be called taste. Yet, though smiling
within herself at the mistake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) honoured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister for that blind
partiality to Edward which produced it.

<p/>"I hope, Marianne," continued Elinor, "you do not consider him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as
deficient in general taste. Indeed, I think I may say that you cannot,
for your behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is perfectly cordial, and if _that_ were your
opinion, I am sure you could never be civil to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)."

<p/>Marianne hardly knew what to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would not wound the feelings of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister on any account, and yet to say what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) did not believe was
impossible. At length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied:

<p/>"Do not be offended, Elinor, if my praise of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is not in every thing
equal to your sense of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merits. I have not had so many opportunities
of estimating the minuter propensities of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) inclinations
and tastes, as you have; but I have the highest opinion in the world of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness and sense. I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) every thing that is worthy and
amiable."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, with a smile, "that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) dearest friends
could not be dissatisfied with such commendation as that. I do not
perceive how you could express yourself more warmly.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne was rejoiced to find her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister so easily pleased.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>Of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sense and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) goodness," continued Elinor, "no one can, I
think, be in doubt, who has seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) often enough to engage him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) in
unreserved conversation. The excellence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) understanding and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
principles can be concealed only by that shyness which too often keeps
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) silent. You know enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to do justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) solid worth.
But of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) minuter propensities, as you call them you have from
peculiar circumstances been kept more ignorant than myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) and I
have been at times thrown a good deal together, while you have been
wholly engrossed on the most affectionate principle by my mother. I
have seen a great deal of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), have studied his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments and heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) opinion on subjects of literature and taste; and, upon the whole, I
venture to pronounce that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mind is well-informed, enjoyment of books
exceedingly great, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) imagination lively, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) observation just and
correct, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) taste delicate and pure. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) abilities in every
respect improve as much upon acquaintance as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) manners and person. At
first sight, his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) address is certainly not striking; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) person can
hardly be called handsome, till the expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eyes, which are
uncommonly good, and the general sweetness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) countenance, is
perceived. At present, I know him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so well, that I think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) really
handsome; or at least, almost so. What say you, Marianne?"

<p/>"I shall very soon think him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) handsome, Elinor, if I do not now. When
you tell me to love him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) as a brother, I shall no more see imperfection
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) face, than I now do in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) heart."

<p/>Elinor started at this declaration, and was sorry for the warmth she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
had been betrayed into, in speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt that Edward stood
very high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed the regard to be mutual; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
required greater certainty of it to make Marianne’s conviction of their
attachment agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that what Marianne and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother
conjectured one moment, they believed the next—that with them, to wish
was to hope, and to hope was to expect. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tried to explain the real
state of the case to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not attempt to deny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), "that I think very highly of
him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)—that I greatly esteem, that I like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)."

<p/>Marianne here burst forth with indignation—

<p/>"Esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)! Cold-hearted Elinor! Oh! worse than
cold-hearted! Ashamed of being otherwise. Use those words again, and I
will leave the room this moment.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor could not help laughing. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Excuse me," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); "and be assured
that I meant no offence to you, by speaking, in so quiet a way, of my
own feelings. Believe them to be stronger than I have declared; believe
them, in short, to be such as his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) merit, and the suspicion—the hope of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection for me may warrant, without imprudence or folly. But
farther than this you must _not_ believe. I am by no means assured of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard for me. There are moments when the extent of it seems
doubtful; and till his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sentiments are fully known, you cannot wonder at
my wishing to avoid any encouragement of my own partiality, by
believing or calling it more than it is. In my heart I feel
little—scarcely any doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference. But there are other points
to be considered besides his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) inclination. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is very far from being
independent. What his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother really is we cannot know; but, from
Fanny’s occasional mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conduct and opinions, we have never
been disposed to think her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) amiable; and I am very much mistaken if
Edward is not himself aware that there would be many difficulties in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) way, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) were to wish to marry a woman who had not either a great
fortune or high rank.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne was astonished to find how much the imagination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother
and herself had outstripped the truth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And you really are not engaged to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)!" said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). "Yet it certainly
soon will happen. But two advantages will proceed from this delay. _I_
shall not lose you so soon, and Edward will have greater opportunity of
improving that natural taste for your favourite pursuit which must be
so indispensably necessary to your future felicity. Oh! if he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) should be
so far stimulated by your genius as to learn to draw himself, how
delightful it would be!"

<p/>Elinor had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) real opinion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not consider
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) partiality for Edward in so prosperous a state as Marianne had
believed it. There was, at times, a want of spirits about him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) which, if
it did not denote indifference, spoke of something almost as
unpromising. A doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) regard, supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to feel it, need not
give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) more than inquietude. It would not be likely to produce that
dejection of mind which frequently attended him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). A more reasonable
cause might be found in the dependent situation which forbade the
indulgence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affection. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) knew that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) mother neither behaved
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) so as to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) home comfortable at present, nor to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
any assurance that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might form a home for himself, without strictly
attending to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) views for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) aggrandizement. With such a knowledge as
this, it was impossible for Elinor to feel easy on the subject. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was
far from depending on that result of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) preference of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
mother and sister still considered as certain. Nay, the longer they
were together the more doubtful seemed the nature of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) regard; and
sometimes, for a few painful minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) believed it to be no more
than friendship.

<p/>But, whatever might really be its limits, it was enough, when perceived
by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sister, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uneasy, and at the same time, (which was
still more common,) to make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncivil. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) took the first opportunity
of affronting her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mother-in-law on the occasion, talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) so
expressively of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) brother’s great expectations, of Mrs. Ferrars’s
resolution that both her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sons should marry well, and of the danger
attending any young woman who attempted to _draw him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) in;_ that Mrs.
Dashwood could neither pretend to be unconscious, nor endeavor to be
calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) an answer which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) contempt, and instantly
left the room, resolving that, whatever might be the inconvenience or
expense of so sudden a removal, her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) beloved Elinor should not be
exposed another week to such insinuations.

<p/>In this state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) spirits, a letter was delivered to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) from the
post, which contained a proposal particularly well timed. It was the
offer of a small house, on very easy terms, belonging to a relation of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own, a gentleman of consequence and property in Devonshire. The
letter was from this gentleman himself, and written in the true spirit
of friendly accommodation. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) understood that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was in need of a
dwelling; and though the house he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) now offered her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was merely a cottage,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) that everything should be done to it which she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might
think necessary, if the situation pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) earnestly pressed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), after giving the particulars of the house and garden, to come with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters to Barton Park, the place of his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own residence, from
whence she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) might judge, herself, whether Barton Cottage, for the houses
were in the same parish, could, by any alteration, be made comfortable
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) seemed really anxious to accommodate them and the whole of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) letter was written in so friendly a style as could not fail of
giving pleasure to his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) cousin; more especially at a moment when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
suffering under the cold and unfeeling behaviour of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) nearer
connections. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) needed no time for deliberation or inquiry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
resolution was formed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) read. The situation of Barton, in a county
so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours
before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every
possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first
recommendation. To quit the neighbourhood of Norland was no longer an
evil; it was an object of desire; it was a blessing, in comparison of
the misery of continuing her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter-in-law’s guest; and to remove for
ever from that beloved place would be less painful than to inhabit or
visit it while such a woman was its mistress. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) instantly wrote Sir
John Middleton her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acknowledgment of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) kindness, and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) acceptance
of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) proposal; and then hastened to show both letters to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
daughters, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might be secure of their approbation before her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
answer were sent.

<p/>Elinor had always thought it would be more prudent for them to settle
at some distance from Norland, than immediately amongst their present
acquaintance. On _that_ head, therefore, it was not for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to oppose
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother’s intention of removing into Devonshire. The house, too, as
described by Sir John, was on so simple a scale, and the rent so
uncommonly moderate, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) no right of objection on either
point; and, therefore, though it was not a plan which brought any charm
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fancy, though it was a removal from the vicinity of Norland
beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wishes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) made no attempt to dissuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother from
sending a letter of acquiescence.
