<p/>Who can be in doubt of what followed?  When any two young people take
it into their heads to marry, they are pretty sure by perseverance to
carry their point, be they ever so poor, or ever so imprudent, or ever
so little likely to be necessary to each other's ultimate comfort.
This may be bad morality to conclude with, but I believe it to be
truth; and if such parties succeed, how should a Captain Wentworth and
an Anne Elliot, with the advantage of maturity of mind, consciousness
of right, and one independent fortune between them, fail of bearing
down every opposition?  They might in fact, have borne down a great
deal more than they met with, for there was little to distress them
beyond the want of graciousness and warmth.  Sir Walter made no
objection, and Elizabeth did nothing worse than look cold and
unconcerned.  Captain Wentworth, with five-and-twenty thousand pounds,
and as high in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession as merit and activity could place him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>),
was no longer nobody.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was now esteemed quite worthy to address the
daughter of a foolish, spendthrift baronet, who had not had principle
or sense enough to maintain himself in the situation in which
Providence had placed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), and who could give his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) daughter at present
but a small part of the share of ten thousand pounds which must be hers
hereafter.

<p/>Sir Walter, indeed, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had no affection for Anne, and no vanity
flattered, to make him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) really happy on the occasion, was very far from
thinking it a bad match for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  On the contrary, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) saw more of
Captain Wentworth, saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) repeatedly by daylight, and eyed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) well,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was very much struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) personal claims, and felt that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
superiority of appearance might be not unfairly balanced against her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
superiority of rank; and all this, assisted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) well-sounding name,
enabled Sir Walter at last to prepare his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) pen, with a very good grace,
for the insertion of the marriage in the volume of honour.

<p/>The only one among them, whose opposition of feeling could excite any
serious anxiety was Lady Russell.  Anne knew that Lady Russell must be
suffering some pain in understanding and relinquishing Mr Elliot, and
be making some struggles to become truly acquainted with, and do
justice to Captain Wentworth.  This however was what Lady Russell had
now to do.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must learn to feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been mistaken with
regard to both; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been unfairly influenced by appearances in
each; that because Captain Wentworth's manners had not suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own
ideas, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been too quick in suspecting them to indicate a
character of dangerous impetuosity; and that because Mr Elliot's
manners had precisely pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) in their propriety and correctness,
their general politeness and suavity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been too quick in
receiving them as the certain result of the most correct opinions and
well-regulated mind.  There was nothing less for Lady Russell to do,
than to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been pretty completely wrong, and to take up
a new set of opinions and of hopes.

<p/>There is a quickness of perception in some, a nicety in the discernment
of character, a natural penetration, in short, which no experience in
others can equal, and Lady Russell had been less gifted in this part of
understanding than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) young friend.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was a very good woman,
and if her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) second object was to be sensible and well-judging, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) first
was to see Anne happy.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loved Anne better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
abilities; and when the awkwardness of the beginning was over, found
little hardship in attaching herself as a mother to the man who was
securing the happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) other child.

<p/>Of all the family, Mary was probably the one most immediately gratified
by the circumstance.  It was creditable to have a sister married, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might flatter herself with having been greatly instrumental to the
connexion, by keeping Anne with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in the autumn; and as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
sister must be better than her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband's sisters, it was very agreeable
that Captain Wentworth should be a richer man than either Captain
Benwick or Charles Hayter.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had something to suffer, perhaps, when
they came into contact again, in seeing Anne restored to the rights of
seniority, and the mistress of a very pretty landaulette; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had a
future to look forward to, of powerful consolation.  Anne had no
Uppercross Hall before her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), no landed estate, no headship of a family;
and if they could but keep Captain Wentworth from being made a baronet,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would not change situations with Anne.

<p/>It would be well for the eldest sister if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) were equally satisfied
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) situation, for a change is not very probable there.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
soon the mortification of seeing Mr Elliot withdraw, and no one of
proper condition has since presented himself to raise even the
unfounded hopes which sunk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).

<p/>The news of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cousin Anne's engagement burst on Mr Elliot most
unexpectedly.  It deranged his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) best plan of domestic happiness, his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
best hope of keeping Sir Walter single by the watchfulness which a
son-in-law's rights would have given.  But, though discomfited and
disappointed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could still do something for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own interest and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
own enjoyment.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) soon quitted Bath; and on Mrs Clay's quitting it
soon afterwards, and being next heard of as established under his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
protection in London, it was evident how double a game he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had been
playing, and how determined he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was to save himself from being cut out
by one artful woman, at least.

<p/>Mrs Clay's affections had overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) interest, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had
sacrificed, for the young man's sake, the possibility of scheming
longer for Sir Walter.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) has abilities, however, as well as
affections; and it is now a doubtful point whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) cunning, or
hers, may finally carry the day; whether, after preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) from
being the wife of Sir Walter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) may not be wheedled and caressed at
last into making her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) the wife of Sir William.

<p/>It cannot be doubted that Sir Walter and Elizabeth were shocked and
mortified by the loss of their companion, and the discovery of their
deception in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).  They had their great cousins, to be sure, to resort
to for comfort; but they must long feel that to flatter and follow
others, without being flattered and followed in turn, is but a state of
half enjoyment.

<p/>Anne, satisfied at a very early period of Lady Russell's meaning to
love Captain Wentworth as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) ought, had no other alloy to the
happiness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) prospects than what arose from the consciousness of
having no relations to bestow on him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) which a man of sense could value.
There she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own inferiority very keenly.  The disproportion in
their fortune was nothing; it did not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) a moment's regret; but
to have no family to receive and estimate him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) properly, nothing of
respectability, of harmony, of good will to offer in return for all the
worth and all the prompt welcome which met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) brothers and
sisters, was a source of as lively pain as her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind could well be
sensible of under circumstances of otherwise strong felicity.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
but two friends in the world to add to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) list, Lady Russell and Mrs
Smith.  To those, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was very well disposed to attach himself.
Lady Russell, in spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) former transgressions, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could now
value from his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) heart.  While he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not obliged to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to have been right in originally dividing them, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was ready to say
almost everything else in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) favour, and as for Mrs Smith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had
claims of various kinds to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) quickly and permanently.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) recent good offices by Anne had been enough in themselves, and
their marriage, instead of depriving her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) of one friend, secured her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
two.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was their earliest visitor in their settled life; and Captain
Wentworth, by putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the way of recovering her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) husband's
property in the West Indies, by writing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), acting for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), and
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) through all the petty difficulties of the case with the
activity and exertion of a fearless man and a determined friend, fully
requited the services which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had rendered, or ever meant to render,
to his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) wife.

<p/>Mrs Smith's enjoyments were not spoiled by this improvement of income,
with some improvement of health, and the acquisition of such friends to
be often with, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) cheerfulness and mental alacrity did not fail
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>); and while these prime supplies of good remained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might have
bid defiance even to greater accessions of worldly prosperity.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
might have been absolutely rich and perfectly healthy, and yet be
happy.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spring of felicity was in the glow of her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) spirits, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)
friend Anne's was in the warmth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heart.  Anne was tenderness
itself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's
affection.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession was all that could ever make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) friends
wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sunshine.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must pay
the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if
possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its
national importance.
