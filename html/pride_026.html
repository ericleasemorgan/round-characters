<p/>Mrs. Gardiner’s caution to Elizabeth was punctually and kindly
given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
alone; after honestly telling her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thus went
on:

<p/>"You are too sensible a girl, Lizzy, to fall in love merely
because you are warned against it; and, therefore, I am not
afraid of speaking openly. Seriously, I would have you be on your
guard. Do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) in an
affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent.
I have nothing to say against _him (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>)_; he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) is a most interesting
young man; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) had the fortune he (<font color='blue'><b>guard</b></font>) ought to have, I should
think you could not do better. But as it is, you must not let
your fancy run away with you. You have sense, and we all expect
you to use it. Your father would depend on _your_ resolution and
good conduct, I am sure. You must not disappoint your father."

<p/>"My dear aunt, this is being serious indeed."

<p/>"Yes, and I hope to engage you to be serious likewise."

<p/>"Well, then, you need not be under any alarm. I will take care of
myself, and of Mr. Wickham too. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) shall not be in love with me,
if I can prevent it."

<p/>"Elizabeth, you are not serious now."

<p/>"I beg your pardon, I will try again. At present I am not in love
with Mr. Wickham; no, I certainly am not. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) is, beyond all
comparison, the most agreeable man I ever saw—and if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) becomes
really attached to me—I believe it will be better that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should
not. I see the imprudence of it. Oh! _that_ abominable Mr. Darcy!
My father’s opinion of me does me the greatest honour, and I
should be miserable to forfeit it. My father, however, is partial
to Mr. Wickham. In short, my dear aunt, I should be very sorry to
be the means of making any of you unhappy; but since we see every
day that where there is affection, young people are seldom
withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into
engagements with each other, how can I promise to be wiser than
so many of my fellow-creatures if I am tempted, or how am I even
to know that it would be wisdom to resist? All that I can promise
you, therefore, is not to be in a hurry. I will not be in a hurry
to believe myself his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) first object. When I am in company with
him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>), I will not be wishing. In short, I will do my best."

<p/>"Perhaps it will be as well if you discourage his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) coming here so
very often. At least, you should not _remind_ your mother of
inviting him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As I did the other day,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth with a conscious smile:
"very true, it will be wise in me to refrain from _that_. But do
not imagine that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) is always here so often. It is on your
account that he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) has been so frequently invited this week. You
know my mother’s ideas as to the necessity of constant company
for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) friends. But really, and upon my honour, I will try to do
what I think to be the wisest; and now I hope you are satisfied."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) aunt assured her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was, and Elizabeth having thanked
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for the kindness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hints, they parted; a wonderful
instance of advice being given on such a point, without being
resented.

<p/>Mr. Collins returned into Hertfordshire soon after it had been
quitted by the Gardiners and Jane; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took up his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) abode
with the Lucases, his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) arrival was no great inconvenience to Mrs.
Bennet. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) marriage was now fast approaching, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was at
length so far resigned as to think it inevitable, and even
repeatedly to say, in an ill-natured tone, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">"_wished_
they might be happy."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Thursday was to be the wedding day, and on
Wednesday Miss Lucas paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) farewell visit; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) rose
to take leave, Elizabeth, ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s ungracious and
reluctant good wishes, and sincerely affected herself,
accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) out of the room. As they went downstairs
together, Charlotte said:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I shall depend on hearing from you very often, Eliza."

 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"_That_ you certainly shall."

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"And I have another favour to ask you. Will you come and see me?"

<p/>"We shall often meet, I hope, in Hertfordshire."

<p/>"I am not likely to leave Kent for some time. Promise me,
therefore, to come to Hunsford.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could not refuse, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) foresaw little pleasure in
the visit.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>father Maria</b></font>)</div>My father and Maria are coming to me in March,<div class="bookquote">" added Charlotte,
" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>and I hope you will consent to be of the party. Indeed, Eliza,
you will be as welcome as either of them."

<p/>The wedding took place; the bride and bridegroom set off for Kent
from the church door, and everybody had as much to say, or to
hear, on the subject as usual. Elizabeth soon heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
friend; and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as
it had ever been; that it should be equally unreserved was
impossible. Elizabeth could never address her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) without feeling
that all the comfort of intimacy was over, and though determined
not to slacken as a correspondent, it was for the sake of what
had been, rather than what was. Charlotte’s first letters were
received with a good deal of eagerness; there could not but be
curiosity to know how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) new home, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
would like Lady Catherine, and how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) would dare pronounce
herself to be; though, when the letters were read, Elizabeth felt
that Charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
might have foreseen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) wrote cheerfully, seemed surrounded with
comforts, and mentioned nothing which she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) could not praise. The
house, furniture, neighbourhood, and roads, were all to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
taste, and Lady Catherine’s behaviour was most friendly and
obliging. It was Mr. Collins’s picture of Hunsford and Rosings
rationally softened; and Elizabeth perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must wait
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own visit there to know the rest.

<p/>Jane had already written a few lines to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister to announce
their safe arrival in London; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wrote again, Elizabeth
hoped it would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to say something of the Bingleys.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as
impatience generally is. Jane had been a week in town without
either seeing or hearing from Caroline. She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) accounted for it,
however, by supposing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) last letter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) friend from
Longbourn had by some accident been lost.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My aunt,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) continued, <div class="bookquote">"is going to-morrow into that part of
the town, and I shall take the opportunity of calling in
Grosvenor Street."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) wrote again when the visit was paid, and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) had seen Miss
Bingley. <div class="bookquote">"I did not think Caroline in spirits,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) words,
"but she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) was very glad to see me, and reproached me for giving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) no notice of my coming to London. I was right, therefore, my
last letter had never reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). I enquired after their
brother, of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was well, but so much engaged with Mr.
Darcy that they scarcely ever saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). I found that Miss Darcy
was expected to dinner. I wish I could see her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). My visit was not
long, as Caroline and Mrs. Hurst were going out. I dare say I
shall see them soon here."

<p/>Elizabeth shook her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head over this letter. It convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that
accident only could discover to Mr. Bingley her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s being in
town.

<p/>Four weeks passed away, and Jane saw nothing of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
endeavoured to persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not regret it; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could no longer be blind to Miss Bingley’s inattention. After
waiting at home every morning for a fortnight, and inventing
every evening a fresh excuse for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), the visitor did at last
appear; but the shortness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) stay, and yet more, the
alteration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manner would allow Jane to deceive herself no
longer. The letter which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wrote on this occasion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister
will prove what she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt.

<p/>"My dearest Lizzy will, I am sure, be incapable of triumphing in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) better judgement, at my expense, when I confess myself to
have been entirely deceived in Miss Bingley’s regard for me. But,
my dear sister, though the event has proved you right, do not
think me obstinate if I still assert that, considering what her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
behaviour was, my confidence was as natural as your suspicion. I
do not at all comprehend her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) reason for wishing to be intimate
with me; but if the same circumstances were to happen again, I am
sure I should be deceived again. Caroline did not return my visit
till yesterday; and not a note, not a line, did I receive in the
meantime. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) did come, it was very evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) had no
pleasure in it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) made a slight, formal apology, for not
calling before, said not a word of wishing to see me again, and
was in every respect so altered a creature, that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) went
away I was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no
longer. I pity, though I cannot help blaming her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) was very
wrong in singling me out as she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) did; I can safely say that every
advance to intimacy began on her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) side. But I pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>), because
she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) must feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) has been acting wrong, and because I am
very sure that anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) brother is the cause of it. I need
not explain myself farther; and though _we_ know this anxiety to
be quite needless, yet if she (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) feels it, it will easily account
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Caroline</b></font>) behaviour to me; and so deservedly dear as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
sister, whatever anxiety she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must feel on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behalf is natural
and amiable. I cannot but wonder, however, at her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) having any such
fears now, because, if he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had at all cared about me, we must have
met, long ago. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows of my being in town, I am certain, from
something she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) said herself; and yet it would seem, by her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) manner
of talking, as if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wanted to persuade herself that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is
really partial to Miss Darcy. I cannot understand it. If I were
not afraid of judging harshly, I should be almost tempted to say
that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this. But I
will endeavour to banish every painful thought, and think only of
what will make me happy—your affection, and the invariable
kindness of my dear uncle and aunt. Let me hear from you very
soon. Miss Bingley said something of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) never returning to
Netherfield again, of giving up the house, but not with any
certainty. We had better not mention it. I am extremely glad that
you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at Hunsford.
Pray go to see them, with Sir William and Maria. I am sure you
will be very comfortable there.—Yours, etc."

<p/>This letter gave Elizabeth some pain; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits returned as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considered that Jane would no longer be duped, by the sister
at least. All expectation from the brother was now absolutely
over. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not even wish for a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attentions.
His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) character sunk on every review of it; and as a punishment for
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), as well as a possible advantage to Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) seriously hoped
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) might really soon marry Mr. Darcy’s sister, as by Wickham’s
account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) abundantly regret what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had thrown
away.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner about this time reminded Elizabeth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) promise
concerning that gentleman, and required information; and
Elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt than to herself. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apparent partiality had subsided,
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) attentions were over, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was the admirer of some one else.
Elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see it
and write of it without material pain. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart had been but
slightly touched, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) vanity was satisfied with believing
that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ would have been his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) only choice, had fortune permitted
it. The sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most
remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was now rendering
himself agreeable; but Elizabeth, less clear-sighted perhaps in
this case than in Charlotte’s, did not quarrel with him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
wish of independence. Nothing, on the contrary, could be more
natural; and while able to suppose that it cost him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) a few
struggles to relinquish her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was ready to allow it a wise and
desirable measure for both, and could very sincerely wish him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
happy.

<p/>All this was acknowledged to Mrs. Gardiner; and after relating
the circumstances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) thus went on: "I am now convinced, my dear
aunt, that I have never been much in love; for had I really
experienced that pure and elevating passion, I should at present
detest his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) very name, and wish him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) all manner of evil. But my
feelings are not only cordial towards _him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)_; they are even
impartial towards Miss King. I cannot find out that I hate her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) at
all, or that I am in the least unwilling to think her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) a very good
sort of girl. There can be no love in all this. My watchfulness
has been effectual; and though I certainly should be a more
interesting object to all my acquaintances were I distractedly in
love with him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>), I cannot say that I regret my comparative
insignificance. Importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly.
Kitty and Lydia take his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>) defection much more to heart than I do.
They are young in the ways of the world, and not yet open to the
mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something
to live on as well as the plain."
