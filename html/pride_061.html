<p/>Happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which Mrs.
Bennet got rid of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) two most deserving daughters. With what
delighted pride she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) afterwards visited Mrs. Bingley, and talked
of Mrs. Darcy, may be guessed. I wish I could say, for the sake
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family, that the accomplishment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earnest desire in
the establishment of so many of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) children produced so happy an
effect as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) a sensible, amiable, well-informed woman
for the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) life; though perhaps it was lucky for her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
husband, who might not have relished domestic felicity in so
unusual a form, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) still was occasionally nervous and
invariably silly.

<p/>Mr. Bennet missed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) second daughter exceedingly; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) affection
for her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) drew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) oftener from home than anything else could do.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) delighted in going to Pemberley, especially when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was least
expected.

<p/>Mr. Bingley and Jane remained at Netherfield only a twelvemonth.
So near a vicinity to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mother and Meryton relations was not
desirable even to _his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)_ easy temper, or _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ affectionate heart.
The darling wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters was then gratified; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) bought an
estate in a neighbouring county to Derbyshire, and Jane and
Elizabeth, in addition to every other source of happiness, were
within thirty miles of each other.

<p/>Kitty, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) very material advantage, spent the chief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>)
time with her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) two elder sisters. In society so superior to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had generally known, her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) improvement was great. She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was not
of so ungovernable a temper as Lydia; and, removed from the
influence of Lydia’s example, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) became, by proper attention and
management, less irritable, less ignorant, and less insipid. From
the further disadvantage of Lydia’s society she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) was of course
carefully kept, and though Mrs. Wickham frequently invited her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to
come and stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>), with the promise of balls and young men,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) father would never consent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) going.

<p/>Mary was the only daughter who remained at home; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by Mrs.
Bennet’s being quite unable to sit alone. Mary was obliged to mix
more with the world, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could still moralize over every
morning visit; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was no longer mortified by comparisons
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sisters’ beauty and her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own, it was suspected by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
father that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) submitted to the change without much reluctance.

<p/>As for Wickham and Lydia, their characters suffered no revolution
from the marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters. He (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) bore with philosophy the
conviction that Elizabeth must now become acquainted with
whatever of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and in spite of every thing, was not wholly without hope
that Darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fortune. The
congratulatory letter which Elizabeth received from Lydia on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
marriage, explained to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wife at least, if not by
himself, such a hope was cherished. The letter was to this
effect:

<p/>"My dear Lizzy,
"I wish you joy. If you love Mr. Darcy half as well as I do my
dear Wickham, you must be very happy. It is a great comfort to
have you so rich, and when you have nothing else to do, I hope
you will think of us. I am sure Wickham would like a place at
court very much, and I do not think we shall have quite money
enough to live upon without some help. Any place would do, of
about three or four hundred a year; but however, do not speak to
Mr. Darcy about it, if you had rather not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yours, etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>As it happened that Elizabeth had much rather not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
endeavoured in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer to put an end to every entreaty and
expectation of the kind. Such relief, however, as it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
power to afford, by the practice of what might be called economy
in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own private expences, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) frequently sent them. It had
always been evident to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that such an income as theirs, under
the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants, and
heedless of the future, must be very insufficient to their
support; and whenever they changed their quarters, either Jane or
herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance
towards discharging their bills. Their manner of living, even
when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home, was
unsettled in the extreme. They were always moving from place to
place in quest of a cheap situation, and always spending more
than they ought. His (<font color='blue'><b>theirs</b></font>) affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) soon sunk into
indifference; hers lasted a little longer; and in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
youth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) manners, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) retained all the claims to reputation
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) marriage had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Though Darcy could never receive _him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ at Pemberley, yet, for
Elizabeth’s sake, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) assisted him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) further in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) profession.
Lydia was occasionally a visitor there, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband was gone
to enjoy himself in London or Bath; and with the Bingleys they
both of them frequently staid so long, that even Bingley’s good
humour was overcome, and he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) proceeded so far as to _talk_ of
giving them a hint to be gone.

<p/>Miss Bingley was very deeply mortified by Darcy’s marriage; but
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at
Pemberley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) dropt all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) resentment; was fonder than ever of
Georgiana, almost as attentive to Darcy as heretofore, and paid
off every arrear of civility to Elizabeth.

<p/>Pemberley was now Georgiana’s home; and the attachment of the
sisters was exactly what Darcy had hoped to see. They were able
to love each other even as well as they intended. Georgiana had
the highest opinion in the world of Elizabeth; though at first
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
lively, sportive, manner of talking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), who had
always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
affection, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) now saw the object of open pleasantry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind
received knowledge which had never before fallen in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) way. By
Elizabeth’s instructions, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to comprehend that a woman
may take liberties with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband which a brother will not
always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than
himself.

<p/>Lady Catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
nephew; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) gave way to all the genuine frankness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
character in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reply to the letter which announced its
arrangement, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sent him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) language so very abusive, especially of
Elizabeth, that for some time all intercourse was at an end. But
at length, by Elizabeth’s persuasion, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was prevailed on to
overlook the offence, and seek a reconciliation; and, after a
little further resistance on the part of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) aunt, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resentment
gave way, either to her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), or her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) curiosity to
see how his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) wife conducted herself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) condescended to wait
on them at Pemberley, in spite of that pollution which its woods
had received, not merely from the presence of such a mistress,
but the visits of her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>) uncle and aunt from the city.

<p/>With the Gardiners, they were always on the most intimate terms.
Darcy, as well as Elizabeth, really loved them; and they were
both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons
who, by bringing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into Derbyshire, had been the means of
uniting them.
