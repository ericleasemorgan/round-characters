<p/>During dinner, Mr. Bennet scarcely spoke at all; but when the
servants were withdrawn, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thought it time to have some
conversation with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) guest, and therefore started a subject in
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to shine, by observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seemed very
fortunate in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) patroness. Lady Catherine de Bourgh’s attention
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wishes, and consideration for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) comfort, appeared very
remarkable. Mr. Bennet could not have chosen better. Mr. Collins
was eloquent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) praise. The subject elevated him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to more than
usual solemnity of manner, and with a most important aspect he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
protested that "he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had never in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) life witnessed such behaviour
in a person of rank—such affability and condescension, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had
himself experienced from Lady Catherine. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been graciously
pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had already
had the honour of preaching before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had also asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
twice to dine at Rosings, and had sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) only the Saturday
before, to make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pool of quadrille in the evening. Lady
Catherine was reckoned proud by many people he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) knew, but _he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_ had
never seen anything but affability in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had always spoken
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would to any other gentleman; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made not the
smallest objection to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) joining in the society of the
neighbourhood nor to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) leaving the parish occasionally for a
week or two, to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relations. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had even condescended to
advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to marry as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could, provided he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) chose with
discretion; and had once paid him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) a visit in his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) humble
parsonage, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had perfectly approved all the alterations
he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had been making, and had even vouchsafed to suggest some
herself—some shelves in the closet up stairs."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is all very proper and civil, I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet,
"and I dare say she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is a very agreeable woman. It is a pity that
great ladies in general are not more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Does she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) live near
you, sir?"

<p/>"The garden in which stands my humble abode is separated only by
a lane from Rosings Park, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ladyship’s residence."

<p/>"I think you said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was a widow, sir? Has she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) any family?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has only one daughter, the heiress of Rosings, and of very
extensive property."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, shaking her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) head, "then she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is better off
than many girls. And what sort of young lady is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)? Is she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
handsome?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is a most charming young lady indeed. Lady Catherine herself
says that, in point of true beauty, Miss de Bourgh is far
superior to the handsomest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sex, because there is that in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is unfortunately of a sickly constitution, which has
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from making that progress in many accomplishments
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not have otherwise failed of, as I am informed by
the lady who superintended her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) education, and who still resides
with them. But she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is perfectly amiable, and often condescends to
drive by my humble abode in her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) little phaeton and ponies."

<p/>"Has she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) been presented? I do not remember her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) name among the
ladies at court."

<p/>"Her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) being in
town; and by that means, as I told Lady Catherine one day, has
deprived the British court of its brightest ornament. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ladyship seemed pleased with the idea; and you may imagine that I
am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate
compliments which are always acceptable to ladies. I have more
than once observed to Lady Catherine, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) charming daughter
seemed born to be a duchess, and that the most elevated rank,
instead of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consequence, would be adorned by her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). These
are the kind of little things which please her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, and it
is a sort of attention which I conceive myself peculiarly bound
to pay."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You judge very properly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, "and it is happy for
you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy. May
I ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse
of the moment, or are the result of previous study?"

<p/>"They arise chiefly from what is passing at the time, and though
I sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such
little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary
occasions, I always wish to give them as unstudied an air as
possible."

<p/>Mr. Bennet’s expectations were fully answered. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) cousin was as
absurd as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had hoped, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) listened to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) with the keenest
enjoyment, maintaining at the same time the most resolute
composure of countenance, and, except in an occasional glance at
Elizabeth, requiring no partner in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/>By tea-time, however, the dose had been enough, and Mr. Bennet
was glad to take his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) guest into the drawing-room again, and, when
tea was over, glad to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to read aloud to the ladies. Mr.
Collins readily assented, and a book was produced; but, on
beholding it (for everything announced it to be from a
circulating library), he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) started back, and begging pardon,
protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) never read novels. Kitty stared at him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), and
Lydia exclaimed. Other books were produced, and after some
deliberation he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) chose Fordyce’s Sermons. Lydia gaped as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) opened
the volume, and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had, with very monotonous solemnity,
read three pages, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with:

<p/>"Do you know, mamma, that my uncle Phillips talks of turning away
Richard; and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) does, Colonel Forster will hire him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>). My aunt
told me so herself on Saturday. I shall walk to Meryton to-morrow
to hear more about it, and to ask when Mr. Denny comes back from
town."

<p/>Lydia was bid by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) two eldest sisters to hold her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) tongue; but
Mr. Collins, much offended, laid aside his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) book, and said:

<p/>"I have often observed how little young ladies are interested by
books of a serious stamp, though written solely for their
benefit. It amazes me, I confess; for, certainly, there can be
nothing so advantageous to them as instruction. But I will no
longer importune my young cousin."

<p/>Then turning to Mr. Bennet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) offered himself as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) antagonist
at backgammon. Mr. Bennet accepted the challenge, observing that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling
amusements. Mrs. Bennet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters apologised most civilly
for Lydia’s interruption, and promised that it should not occur
again, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would resume his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) book; but Mr. Collins, after
assuring them that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) bore his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) young cousin no ill-will, and
should never resent her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) behaviour as any affront, seated himself
at another table with Mr. Bennet, and prepared for backgammon.
