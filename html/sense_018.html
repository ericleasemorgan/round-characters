<p/>Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) friend. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>)
visit afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) but a very partial satisfaction, while his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own
enjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was
unhappy; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished it were equally evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) still distinguished
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) by the same affection which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had felt no doubt of
inspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) preference seemed very
uncertain; and the reservedness of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) manner towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) contradicted
one moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) joined her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) and Marianne in the breakfast-room the next morning
before the others were down; and Marianne, who was always eager to
promote their happiness as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could, soon left them to
themselves. But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was half way upstairs she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) heard the parlour
door open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himself
come out.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am going into the village to see my horses,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"as you are
not yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently."


 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surrounding
country; in his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) walk to the village, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had seen many parts of the
valley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situation
than the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which had
exceedingly pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). This was a subject which ensured Marianne’s
attention, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was beginning to describe her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own admiration of
these scenes, and to question him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) more minutely on the objects that had
particularly struck him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), when Edward interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by saying, "You
must not enquire too far, Marianne—remember I have no knowledge in the
picturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of taste
if we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to be
bold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular and
rugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to be
indistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must be
satisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it a very
fine country—the hills are steep, the woods seem full of fine timber,
and the valley looks comfortable and snug—with rich meadows and several
neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactly answers my idea
of a fine country, because it unites beauty with utility—and I dare say
it is a picturesque one too, because you admire it; I can easily
believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, grey moss and brush
wood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing of the picturesque."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid it is but too true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; "but why should you
boast of it?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suspect,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation,
Edward here falls into another. Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) believes many people pretend
to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they really feel, and
is disgusted with such pretensions, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) affects greater indifference and
less discrimination in viewing them himself than he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) possesses. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) is
fastidious and will have an affectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) own."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape scenery
is become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries to
describe with the taste and elegance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) who first defined what
picturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes I
have kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language to
describe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense and
meaning."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am convinced,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight in
a fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sister
must allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect,
but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted,
blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, and
flourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I am not fond of
nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in a snug
farm-house than a watch-tower—and a troop of tidy, happy villagers
please me better than the finest banditti in the world."

<p/>Marianne looked with amazement at Edward, with compassion at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
sister. Elinor only laughed.

<p/>The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remained
thoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attention.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was sitting by Edward, and in taking his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) tea from Mrs. Dashwood,
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) hand passed so directly before her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), as to make a ring, with a plait
of hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fingers.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) cried. "Is that
Fanny’s hair? I remember her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) promising to give you some. But I should
have thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) hair had been darker."

<p/>Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) really felt—but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) saw
how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had pained Edward, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own vexation at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) want of thought
could not be surpassed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) coloured very deeply, and giving a
momentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister’s hair. The
setting always casts a different shade on it, you know."

<p/>Elinor had met his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hair
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne;
the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianne
considered as a free gift from her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister, Elinor was conscious must
have been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, and affecting
to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking of something
else, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) internally resolved henceforward to catch every opportunity
of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond all doubt, that it
was exactly the shade of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own.

<p/>Edward’s embarrassment lasted some time, and it ended in an absence of
mind still more settled. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was particularly grave the whole morning.
Marianne severely censured herself for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had said; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
forgiveness might have been more speedy, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) known how little
offence it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at the
cottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance of his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>)
mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the name of
Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of raillery
against the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of their
acquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediately
sprung. But, as it was, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only learned, from some very significant
looks, how far their penetration, founded on Margaret’s instructions,
extended.

<p/>Sir John never came to the Dashwoods without either inviting them to
dine at the park the next day, or to drink tea with them that evening.
On the present occasion, for the better entertainment of their visitor,
towards whose amusement he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) felt himself bound to contribute, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) wished
to engage them for both.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You _must_ drink tea with us to night,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>), "for we shall be
quite alone—and tomorrow you must absolutely dine with us, for we shall
be a large party."

<p/>Mrs. Jennings enforced the necessity. <div class="bookquote">"And who knows but you may raise
a dance,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"And that will tempt _you_, Miss Marianne."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"A dance!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>cried Marianne. "Impossible! Who is to dance?"

<p/>"Who! why yourselves, and the Careys, and Whitakers to be sure.—What!
you thought nobody could dance because a certain person that shall be
nameless is gone!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wish with all my soul,"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John, "that Willoughby were among
us again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This, and Marianne’s blushing, gave new suspicions to Edward. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>And who
is Willoughby?" said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), in a low voice, to Miss Dashwood, by whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
was sitting.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) a brief reply. Marianne’s countenance was more
communicative. Edward saw enough to comprehend, not only the meaning of
others, but such of Marianne’s expressions as had puzzled him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) before;
and when their visitors left them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) went immediately round her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and
said, in a whisper, "I have been guessing. Shall I tell you my guess?"

<p/>"What do you mean?"

<p/>"Shall I tell you?"

<p/>"Certainly."

<p/>"Well then; I guess that Mr. Willoughby hunts."

<p/>Marianne was surprised and confused, yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not help smiling at
the quiet archness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, and after a moment’s silence, said,

<p/>"Oh, Edward! How can you?—But the time will come I hope...I am sure you
will like him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)."

<p/>"I do not doubt it," replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), rather astonished at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) earnestness
and warmth; for had he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) not imagined it to be a joke for the good of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
acquaintance in general, founded only on a something or a nothing
between Mr. Willoughby and herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) would not have ventured to
mention it.
