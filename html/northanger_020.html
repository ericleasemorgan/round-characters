<p/>A few days passed away, and Catherine, though not allowing herself to
suspect her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, could not help watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) closely. The result of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) observations was not agreeable. Isabella seemed an altered
creature. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), indeed, surrounded only by their immediate
friends in Edgar’s Buildings or Pulteney Street, her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) change of manners
was so trifling that, had it gone no farther, it might have passed
unnoticed. A something of languid indifference, or of that boasted
absence of mind which Catherine had never heard of before, would
occasionally come across her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but had nothing worse appeared, _that_
might only have spread a new grace and inspired a warmer interest. But
when Catherine saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) in public, admitting Captain Tilney’s attentions
as readily as they were offered, and allowing him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) almost an equal share
with James in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) notice and smiles, the alteration became too positive
to be passed over. What could be meant by such unsteady conduct, what
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend could be at, was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) comprehension. Isabella could
not be aware of the pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was inflicting; but it was a degree of
wilful thoughtlessness which Catherine could not but resent. James was
the sufferer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) grave and uneasy; and however careless of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>)
present comfort the woman might be who had given him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) heart, to
_her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)_ it was always an object. For poor Captain Tilney too she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was
greatly concerned. Though his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looks did not please her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) name was a
passport to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) goodwill, and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) thought with sincere compassion of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) approaching disappointment; for, in spite of what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had believed
herself to overhear in the pump-room, his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) behaviour was so incompatible
with a knowledge of Isabella’s engagement that she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not, upon
reflection, imagine him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) aware of it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) might be jealous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) brother
as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) misapprehension. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) wished, by a gentle remonstrance, to remind
Isabella of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) situation, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) aware of this double
unkindness; but for remonstrance, either opportunity or comprehension
was always against her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>). If able to suggest a hint, Isabella could never
understand it. In this distress, the intended departure of the Tilney
family became her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) chief consolation; their journey into Gloucestershire
was to take place within a few days, and Captain Tilney’s removal would
at least restore peace to every heart but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) own. But Captain Tilney
had at present no intention of removing; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was not to be of the party
to Northanger; he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was to continue at Bath. When Catherine knew this,
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution was directly made. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spoke to Henry Tilney on the
subject, regretting his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) brother’s evident partiality for Miss Thorpe,
and entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to make known her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) prior engagement.

<p/>"My brother does know it," was Henry’s answer.

<p/>"Does he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)? Then why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stay here?"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made no reply, and was beginning to talk of something else; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
eagerly continued, "Why do not you persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) to go away? The longer
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) stays, the worse it will be for him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) at last. Pray advise him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
own sake, and for everybody’s sake, to leave Bath directly. Absence
will in time make him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) comfortable again; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) can have no hope here,
and it is only staying to be miserable."

<p/>Henry smiled and said, "I am sure my brother would not wish to do
that."

<p/>"Then you will persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to go away?"

<p/>"Persuasion is not at command; but pardon me, if I cannot even
endeavour to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). I have myself told him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that Miss Thorpe is
engaged. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is about, and must be his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own master."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is about,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine; "he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) does not
know the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is giving my brother. Not that James has ever told me
so, but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) is very uncomfortable."

<p/>"And are you sure it is my brother’s doing?"

<p/>"Yes, very sure."

<p/>"Is it my brother’s attentions to Miss Thorpe, or Miss Thorpe’s
admission of them, that gives the pain?"

<p/>"Is not it the same thing?"

<p/>"I think Mr. Morland would acknowledge a difference. No man is offended
by another man’s admiration of the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loves; it is the woman only
who can make it a torment."

<p/>Catherine blushed for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friend, and said, "Isabella is wrong. But I
am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) cannot mean to torment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is very much attached to my
brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has been in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever since they first met, and
while my father’s consent was uncertain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) fretted herself almost
into a fever. You know she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) must be attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)."

<p/>"I understand: she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is in love with James, and flirts with Frederick."

<p/>"Oh! no, not flirts. A woman in love with one man cannot flirt with
another."

<p/>"It is probable that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will neither love so well, nor flirt so well,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) might do either singly. The gentlemen must each give up a
little."

<p/>After a short pause, Catherine resumed with, "Then you do not believe
Isabella so very much attached to my brother?"

<p/>"I can have no opinion on that subject."

<p/>"But what can your brother mean? If he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) engagement, what can
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) mean by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) behaviour?"

<p/>"You are a very close questioner."

<p/>"Am I? I only ask what I want to be told."

<p/>"But do you only ask what I can be expected to tell?"

<p/>"Yes, I think so; for you must know your brother’s heart."

<p/>"My brother’s heart, as you term it, on the present occasion, I assure
you I can only guess at."

<p/>"Well?"

<p/>"Well! Nay, if it is to be guesswork, let us all guess for ourselves.
To be guided by second-hand conjecture is pitiful. The premises are
before you. My brother is a lively and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless
young man; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has had about a week’s acquaintance with your friend, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has known her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>) engagement almost as long as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has known her (<font color='blue'><b>My</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, after some moments’ consideration, "_you_ may
be able to guess at your brother’s intentions from all this; but I am
sure I cannot. But is not your father uncomfortable about it? Does not
he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) want Captain Tilney to go away? Sure, if your father were to speak
to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would go."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Miss Morland,"  (<font color='red'><b>Tilney/Henry/Henry Tilney</b></font>)</div>said Henry, "in this amiable solicitude for
your brother’s comfort, may you not be a little mistaken? Are you not
carried a little too far? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thank you, either on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own account
or Miss Thorpe’s, for supposing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) affection, or at least her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
good behaviour, is only to be secured by her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) seeing nothing of Captain
Tilney? Is he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) safe only in solitude? Or is her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) heart constant to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
only when unsolicited by anyone else? He (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) cannot think this—and you may
be sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) would not have you think it. I will not say, <div class="bookquote">‘Do not be
uneasy,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>because I know that you are so, at this moment; but be as
little uneasy as you can. You have no doubt of the mutual attachment of
your brother and your friend; depend upon it, therefore, that real
jealousy never can exist between them; depend upon it that no
disagreement between them can be of any duration. Their hearts are open
to each other, as neither heart can be to you; they know exactly what
is required and what can be borne; and you may be certain that one will
never tease the other beyond what is known to be pleasant."

<p/>Perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) still to look doubtful and grave, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) added, "Though
Frederick does not leave Bath with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) will probably remain but a
very short time, perhaps only a few days behind us. His (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) leave of
absence will soon expire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) must return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) regiment. And what
will then be their acquaintance? The mess-room will drink Isabella
Thorpe for a fortnight, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) will laugh with your brother over poor
Tilney’s passion for a month."

<p/>Catherine would contend no longer against comfort. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had resisted its
approaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
captive. Henry Tilney must know best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) blamed herself for the extent
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject
again.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution was supported by Isabella’s behaviour in their parting
interview. The Thorpes spent the last evening of Catherine’s stay in
Pulteney Street, and nothing passed between the lovers to excite her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
uneasiness, or make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quit them in apprehension. James was in
excellent spirits, and Isabella most engagingly placid. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) tenderness
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) friend seemed rather the first feeling of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) heart; but that
at such a moment was allowable; and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) lover a flat
contradiction, and once she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) drew back her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) hand; but Catherine
remembered Henry’s instructions, and placed it all to judicious
affection. The embraces, tears, and promises of the parting fair ones
may be fancied.
