<p/>Fanny seemed nearer being right than Edmund had supposed. The business
of finding a play that would suit everybody proved to be no trifle; and
the carpenter had received his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) orders and taken his (<font color='blue'><b>carpenter</b></font>) measurements, had
suggested and removed at least two sets of difficulties, and having
made the necessity of an enlargement of plan and expense fully evident,
was already at work, while a play was still to seek. Other preparations
were also in hand. An enormous roll of green baize had arrived from
Northampton, and been cut out by Mrs. Norris (with a saving by her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) good
management of full three-quarters of a yard), and was actually forming
into a curtain by the housemaids, and still the play was wanting; and
as two or three days passed away in this manner, Edmund began almost to
hope that none might ever be found.

<p/>There were, in fact, so many things to be attended to, so many people
to be pleased, so many best characters required, and, above all, such a
need that the play should be at once both tragedy and comedy, that
there did seem as little chance of a decision as anything pursued by
youth and zeal could hold out.

<p/>On the tragic side were the Miss Bertrams, Henry Crawford, and Mr.
Yates; on the comic, Tom Bertram, not _quite_ alone, because it was
evident that Mary Crawford’s wishes, though politely kept back,
inclined the same way: but his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) determinateness and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) power seemed to
make allies unnecessary; and, independent of this great irreconcilable
difference, they wanted a piece containing very few characters in the
whole, but every character first-rate, and three principal women. All
the best plays were run over in vain. Neither Hamlet, nor Macbeth, nor
Othello, nor Douglas, nor The Gamester, presented anything that could
satisfy even the tragedians; and The Rivals, The School for Scandal,
Wheel of Fortune, Heir at Law, and a long et cetera, were successively
dismissed with yet warmer objections. No piece could be proposed that
did not supply somebody with a difficulty, and on one side or the other
it was a continual repetition of, "Oh no, _that_ will never do! Let us
have no ranting tragedies. Too many characters. Not a tolerable woman’s
part in the play. Anything but _that_, my dear Tom. It would be
impossible to fill it up. One could not expect anybody to take such a
part. Nothing but buffoonery from beginning to end. _That_ might do,
perhaps, but for the low parts. If I _must_ give my opinion, I have
always thought it the most insipid play in the English language. _I_ do
not wish to make objections; I shall be happy to be of any use, but I
think we could not chuse worse."

<p/>Fanny looked on and listened, not unamused to observe the selfishness
which, more or less disguised, seemed to govern them all, and wondering
how it would end. For her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own gratification she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could have wished that
something might be acted, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never seen even half a play, but
everything of higher consequence was against it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This will never do,"  (<font color='red'><b>Tom Bertram/Tom/Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Tom Bertram at last. "We are wasting time
most abominably. Something must be fixed on. No matter what, so that
something is chosen. We must not be so nice. A few characters too many
must not frighten us. We must _double_ them. We must descend a little.
If a part is insignificant, the greater our credit in making anything
of it. From this moment I make no difficulties. I take any part you
chuse to give me, so as it be comic. Let it but be comic, I condition
for nothing more."

<p/>For about the fifth time he (<font color='blue'><b>We</b></font>) then proposed the Heir at Law, doubting
only whether to prefer Lord Duberley or Dr. Pangloss for himself; and
very earnestly, but very unsuccessfully, trying to persuade the others
that there were some fine tragic parts in the rest of the Dramatis
Personæ.

<p/>The pause which followed this fruitless effort was ended by the same
speaker, who, taking up one of the many volumes of plays that lay on
the table, and turning it over, suddenly exclaimed—"Lovers’ Vows! And
why should not Lovers’ Vows do for _us_ as well as for the Ravenshaws?
How came it never to be thought of before? It strikes me as if it would
do exactly. What say you all? Here are two capital tragic parts for
Yates and Crawford, and here is the rhyming Butler for me, if nobody
else wants it; a trifling part, but the sort of thing I should not
dislike, and, as I said before, I am determined to take anything and do
my best. And as for the rest, they may be filled up by anybody. It is
only Count Cassel and Anhalt."

<p/>The suggestion was generally welcome. Everybody was growing weary of
indecision, and the first idea with everybody was, that nothing had
been proposed before so likely to suit them all. Mr. Yates was
particularly pleased: he (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) had been sighing and longing to do the Baron
at Ecclesford, had grudged every rant of Lord Ravenshaw’s, and been
forced to re-rant it all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own room. The storm through Baron
Wildenheim was the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) theatrical ambition; and with the
advantage of knowing half the scenes by heart already, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) did now, with
the greatest alacrity, offer his (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) services for the part. To do him (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>)
justice, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Baron</b></font>) did not resolve to appropriate it; for remembering
that there was some very good ranting-ground in Frederick, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) professed
an equal willingness for that. Henry Crawford was ready to take either.
Whichever Mr. Yates did not chuse would perfectly satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>), and a
short parley of compliment ensued. Miss Bertram, feeling all the
interest of an Agatha in the question, took on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) to decide it, by
observing to Mr. Yates that this was a point in which height and figure
ought to be considered, and that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>)_ being the tallest, seemed to fit
him (<font color='blue'><b>Yates</b></font>) peculiarly for the Baron. She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) was acknowledged to be quite right,
and the two parts being accepted accordingly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) was certain of the
proper Frederick. Three of the characters were now cast, besides Mr.
Rushworth, who was always answered for by Maria as willing to do
anything; when Julia, meaning, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister, to be Agatha, began to
be scrupulous on Miss Crawford’s account.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is not behaving well by the absent,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). "Here are not
women enough. Amelia and Agatha may do for Maria and me, but here is
nothing for your sister, Mr. Crawford."

<p/>Mr. Crawford desired _that_ might not be thought of: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was very sure
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister had no wish of acting but as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might be useful, and that
she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would not allow herself to be considered in the present case. But
this was immediately opposed by Tom Bertram, who asserted the part of
Amelia to be in every respect the property of Miss Crawford, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would accept it. <div class="bookquote">"It falls as naturally, as necessarily to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), "as Agatha does to one or other of my sisters. It can be no
sacrifice on their side, for it is highly comic."

<p/>A short silence followed. Each sister looked anxious; for each felt the
best claim to Agatha, and was hoping to have it pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) by the
rest. Henry Crawford, who meanwhile had taken up the play, and with
seeming carelessness was turning over the first act, soon settled the
business.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must entreat Miss _Julia_ Bertram,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>), "not to engage in the
part of Agatha, or it will be the ruin of all my solemnity. You must
not, indeed you must not<div class="bookquote">" (turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>)). " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I could not stand your
countenance dressed up in woe and paleness. The many laughs we have had
together would infallibly come across me, and Frederick and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
knapsack would be obliged to run away."

<p/>Pleasantly, courteously, it was spoken; but the manner was lost in the
matter to Julia’s feelings. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) saw a glance at Maria which confirmed
the injury to herself: it was a scheme, a trick; she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) was slighted,
Maria was preferred; the smile of triumph which Maria was trying to
suppress shewed how well it was understood; and before Julia could
command herself enough to speak, her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) brother gave his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) weight against
her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) too, by saying, "Oh yes! Maria must be Agatha. Maria will be the
best Agatha. Though Julia fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) prefers tragedy, I would not
trust her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) in it. There is nothing of tragedy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) has not the
look of it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) features are not tragic features, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) walks too
quick, and speaks too quick, and would not keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) countenance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
had better do the old countrywoman: the Cottager’s wife; you had,
indeed, Julia. Cottager’s wife is a very pretty part, I assure you. The
old lady relieves the high-flown benevolence of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) husband with a good
deal of spirit. You shall be Cottager’s wife."

<p/>"Cottager’s wife!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Yates. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What are you talking of? The most
trivial, paltry, insignificant part; the merest commonplace; not a
tolerable speech in the whole. Your sister do that! It is an insult to
propose it. At Ecclesford the governess was to have done it. We all
agreed that it could not be offered to anybody else. A little more
justice, Mr. Manager, if you please. You do not deserve the office, if
you cannot appreciate the talents of your company a little better."

<p/>"Why, as to _that_, my good friend, till I and my company have really
acted there must be some guesswork; but I mean no disparagement to
Julia. We cannot have two Agathas, and we must have one Cottager’s
wife; and I am sure I set her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) the example of moderation myself in being
satisfied with the old Butler. If the part is trifling she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) will have
more credit in making something of it; and if she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is so desperately
bent against everything humorous, let her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) take Cottager’s speeches
instead of Cottager’s wife’s, and so change the parts all through; _he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>)_
is solemn and pathetic enough, I am sure. It could make no difference
in the play, and as for Cottager himself, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) has got his (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) wife’s
speeches, _I_ would undertake him (<font color='blue'><b>Butler</b></font>) with all my heart."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"With all your partiality for Cottager’s wife,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Henry Crawford,
"it will be impossible to make anything of it fit for your sister, and
we must not suffer her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) good-nature to be imposed on. We must not
_allow_ her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to accept the part. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) must not be left to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own
complaisance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) talents will be wanted in Amelia. Amelia is a
character more difficult to be well represented than even Agatha. I
consider Amelia is the most difficult character in the whole piece. It
requires great powers, great nicety, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) playfulness and
simplicity without extravagance. I have seen good actresses fail in the
part. Simplicity, indeed, is beyond the reach of almost every actress
by profession. It requires a delicacy of feeling which they have not.
It requires a gentlewoman—a Julia Bertram. You _will_ undertake it, I
hope?<div class="bookquote">" turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) with a look of anxious entreaty, which softened
her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) a little; but while she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) hesitated what to say, her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) brother again
interposed with Miss Crawford’s better claim.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>No, no, Julia must not be Amelia. It is not at all the part for her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) would not like it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) would not do well. She (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>) is too tall and
robust. Amelia should be a small, light, girlish, skipping figure. It
is fit for Miss Crawford, and Miss Crawford only. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looks the part,
and I am persuaded will do it admirably.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Without attending to this, Henry Crawford continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) supplication.
" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>You must oblige us," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), "indeed you must. When you have studied
the character, I am sure you will feel it suit you. Tragedy may be your
choice, but it will certainly appear that comedy chuses _you_. You will
be to visit me in prison with a basket of provisions; you will not
refuse to visit me in prison? I think I see you coming in with your
basket."

<p/>The influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) voice was felt. Julia wavered; but was he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) only
trying to soothe and pacify her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>), and make her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) overlook the previous
affront? She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) distrusted him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>). The slight had been most determined. He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
was, perhaps, but at treacherous play with her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) looked suspiciously
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) sister; Maria’s countenance was to decide it: if she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) were vexed
and alarmed—but Maria looked all serenity and satisfaction, and Julia
well knew that on this ground Maria could not be happy but at her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
expense. With hasty indignation, therefore, and a tremulous voice, she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>)
said to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"You do not seem afraid of not keeping your countenance
when I come in with a basket of provisions—though one might have
supposed—but it is only as Agatha that I was to be so overpowering!"
 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) stopped—Henry Crawford looked rather foolish, and as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not
know what to say. Tom Bertram began again—

<p/>"Miss Crawford must be Amelia. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) will be an excellent Amelia."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not be afraid of _my_ wanting the character,"  (<font color='red'><b>Julia</b></font>)</div>cried Julia, with
angry quickness: "I am _not_ to be Agatha, and I am sure I will do
nothing else; and as to Amelia, it is of all parts in the world the
most disgusting to me. I quite detest her (<font color='blue'><b>Amelia</b></font>). An odious, little, pert,
unnatural, impudent girl. I have always protested against comedy, and
this is comedy in its worst form." And so saying, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) walked hastily
out of the room, leaving awkward feelings to more than one, but
exciting small compassion in any except Fanny, who had been a quiet
auditor of the whole, and who could not think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as under the
agitations of _jealousy_ without great pity.

<p/>A short silence succeeded her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) leaving them; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother soon
returned to business and Lovers’ Vows, and was eagerly looking over the
play, with Mr. Yates’s help, to ascertain what scenery would be
necessary—while Maria and Henry Crawford conversed together in an
under-voice, and the declaration with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) began of, <div class="bookquote">"I am sure I
would give up the part to Julia most willingly, but that though I shall
probably do it very ill, I feel persuaded _she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)_ would do it worse,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was
doubtless receiving all the compliments it called for.

<p/>When this had lasted some time, the division of the party was completed
by Tom Bertram and Mr. Yates walking off together to consult farther in
the room now beginning to be called _the_ _Theatre_, and Miss Bertram’s
resolving to go down to the Parsonage herself with the offer of Amelia
to Miss Crawford; and Fanny remained alone.

<p/>The first use she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) made of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) solitude was to take up the volume which
had been left on the table, and begin to acquaint herself with the play
of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had heard so much. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) curiosity was all awake, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
ran through it with an eagerness which was suspended only by intervals
of astonishment, that it could be chosen in the present instance, that
it could be proposed and accepted in a private theatre! Agatha and
Amelia appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Agatha</b></font>) in their different ways so totally improper for
home representation—the situation of one, and the language of the
other, so unfit to be expressed by any woman of modesty, that she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) could
hardly suppose her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cousins could be aware of what they were engaging
in; and longed to have them roused as soon as possible by the
remonstrance which Edmund would certainly make.
