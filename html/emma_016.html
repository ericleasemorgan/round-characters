<p/>The hair was curled, and the maid sent away, and Emma sat down to think and be miserable. It was a wretched business indeed! Such an overthrow of every thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been wishing for! Such a development of every thing most unwelcome! Such a blow for Harriet! that was the worst of all. Every part of it brought pain and humiliation, of some sort or other; but, compared with the evil to Harriet, all was light; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would gladly have submitted to feel yet more mistaken more in error more disgraced by mis-judgment, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) actually was, could the effects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) blunders have been confined to herself.

<p/>"If I had not persuaded Harriet into liking the man, I could have borne any thing. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have doubled his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) presumption to me but poor Harriet!"

<p/>How she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could have been so deceived! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) protested that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had never thought seriously of Harriet never! She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked back as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could; but it was all confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had taken up the idea, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not have been so misled.

<p/>The picture! How eager he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been about the picture! and the charade! and an hundred other circumstances; how clearly they had seemed to point at Harriet. To be sure, the charade, with its <div class="bookquote">"ready wit"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>but then the <div class="bookquote">"soft eyes"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>in fact it suited neither; it was a jumble without taste or truth. Who could have seen through such thick-headed nonsense?

<p/>Certainly she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had often, especially of late, thought his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) manners to herself unnecessarily gallant; but it had passed as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) way, as a mere error of judgment, of knowledge, of taste, as one proof among others that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not always lived in the best society, that with all the gentleness of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address, true elegance was sometimes wanting; but, till this very day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had never, for an instant, suspected it to mean any thing but grateful respect to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as Harriet's friend.

<p/>To Mr. John Knightley was she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) indebted for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) first idea on the subject, for the first start of its possibility. There was no denying that those brothers had penetration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) remembered what Mr. Knightley had once said to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) about Mr. Elton, the caution he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had given, the conviction he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had professed that Mr. Elton would never marry indiscreetly; and blushed to think how much truer a knowledge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) character had been there shewn than any she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had reached herself. It was dreadfully mortifying; but Mr. Elton was proving himself, in many respects, the very reverse of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had meant and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); proud, assuming, conceited; very full of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own claims, and little concerned about the feelings of others.

<p/>Contrary to the usual course of things, Mr. Elton's wanting to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sunk him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) opinion. His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) professions and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) proposals did him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) no service. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thought nothing of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attachment, and was insulted by his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hopes. He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) wanted to marry well, and having the arrogance to raise his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), pretended to be in love; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was perfectly easy as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) not suffering any disappointment that need be cared for. There had been no real affection either in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language or manners. Sighs and fine words had been given in abundance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could hardly devise any set of expressions, or fancy any tone of voice, less allied with real love. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) need not trouble herself to pity him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) only wanted to aggrandise and enrich himself; and if Miss Woodhouse of Hartfield, the heiress of thirty thousand pounds, were not quite so easily obtained as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would soon try for Miss Somebody else with twenty, or with ten.

<p/>But that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should talk of encouragement, should consider her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) as aware of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) views, accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) attentions, meaning (in short), to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>)! should suppose himself her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) equal in connexion or mind! look down upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) friend, so well understanding the gradations of rank below him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), and be so blind to what rose above, as to fancy himself shewing no presumption in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>)! It was most provoking.

<p/>Perhaps it was not fair to expect him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) to feel how very much he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) was her (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) inferior in talent, and all the elegancies of mind. The very want of such equality might prevent his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) perception of it; but he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must know that in fortune and consequence she (<font color='blue'><b>Somebody</b></font>) was greatly his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) superior. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) must know that the Woodhouses had been settled for several generations at Hartfield, the younger branch of a very ancient family and that the Eltons were nobody. The landed property of Hartfield certainly was inconsiderable, being but a sort of notch in the Donwell Abbey estate, to which all the rest of Highbury belonged; but their fortune, from other sources, was such as to make them scarcely secondary to Donwell Abbey itself, in every other kind of consequence; and the Woodhouses had long held a high place in the consideration of the neighbourhood which Mr. Elton had first entered not two years ago, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) could, without any alliances but in trade, or any thing to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to notice but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) situation and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civility. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had fancied her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); that evidently must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) dependence; and after raving a little about the seeming incongruity of gentle manners and a conceited head, Emma was obliged in common honesty to stop and admit that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own behaviour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been so complaisant and obliging, so full of courtesy and attention, as (supposing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real motive unperceived) might warrant a man of ordinary observation and delicacy, like Mr. Elton, in fancying himself a very decided favourite. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had so misinterpreted his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had little right to wonder that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), with self-interest to blind him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), should have mistaken hers.

<p/>The first error and the worst lay at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) door. It was foolish, it was wrong, to take so active a part in bringing any two people together. It was adventuring too far, assuming too much, making light of what ought to be serious, a trick of what ought to be simple. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was quite concerned and ashamed, and resolved to do such things no more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Here have I,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), "actually talked poor Harriet into being very much attached to this man. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might never have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) but for me; and certainly never would have thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) with hope, if I had not assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attachment, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is as modest and humble as I used to think him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Oh! that I had been satisfied with persuading her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) not to accept young Martin. There I was quite right. That was well done of me; but there I should have stopped, and left the rest to time and chance. I was introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) into good company, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the opportunity of pleasing some one worth having; I ought not to have attempted more. But now, poor girl, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) peace is cut up for some time. I have been but half a friend to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); and if she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) were not to feel this disappointment so very much, I am sure I have not an idea of any body else who would be at all desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>); William Coxe Oh! no, I could not endure William Coxe a pert young lawyer."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopt to blush and laugh at her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) own relapse, and then resumed a more serious, more dispiriting cogitation upon what had been, and might be, and must be. The distressing explanation she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) had to make to Harriet, and all that poor Harriet would be suffering, with the awkwardness of future meetings, the difficulties of continuing or discontinuing the acquaintance, of subduing feelings, concealing resentment, and avoiding eclat, were enough to occupy her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in most unmirthful reflections some time longer, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) went to bed at last with nothing settled but the conviction of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) having blundered most dreadfully.

<p/>To youth and natural cheerfulness like Emma's, though under temporary gloom at night, the return of day will hardly fail to bring return of spirits. The youth and cheerfulness of morning are in happy analogy, and of powerful operation; and if the distress be not poignant enough to keep the eyes unclosed, they will be sure to open to sensations of softened pain and brighter hope.

<p/>Emma got up on the morrow more disposed for comfort than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had gone to bed, more ready to see alleviations of the evil before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and to depend on getting tolerably out of it.

<p/>It was a great consolation that Mr. Elton should not be really in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), or so particularly amiable as to make it shocking to disappoint him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that Harriet's nature should not be of that superior sort in which the feelings are most acute and retentive and that there could be no necessity for any body's knowing what had passed except the three principals, and especially for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's being given a moment's uneasiness about it.

<p/>These were very cheering thoughts; and the sight of a great deal of snow on the ground did her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) further service, for any thing was welcome that might justify their all three being quite asunder at present.

<p/>The weather was most favourable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); though Christmas Day, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not go to church. Mr. Woodhouse would have been miserable had his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter attempted it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was therefore safe from either exciting or receiving unpleasant and most unsuitable ideas. The ground covered with snow, and the atmosphere in that unsettled state between frost and thaw, which is of all others the most unfriendly for exercise, every morning beginning in rain or snow, and every evening setting in to freeze, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was for many days a most honourable prisoner. No intercourse with Harriet possible but by note; no church for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) on Sunday any more than on Christmas Day; and no need to find excuses for Mr. Elton's absenting himself.

<p/>It was weather which might fairly confine every body at home; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped and believed him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) to be really taking comfort in some society or other, it was very pleasant to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father so well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being all alone in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own house, too wise to stir out; and to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) say to Mr. Knightley, whom no weather could keep entirely from them,

<p/>"Ah! Mr. Knightley, why do not you stay at home like poor Mr. Elton?"

<p/>These days of confinement would have been, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) private perplexities, remarkably comfortable, as such seclusion exactly suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) brother, whose feelings must always be of great importance to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) companions; and he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had, besides, so thoroughly cleared off his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ill-humour at Randalls, that his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) amiableness never failed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) during the rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) stay at Hartfield. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was always agreeable and obliging, and speaking pleasantly of every body. But with all the hopes of cheerfulness, and all the present comfort of delay, there was still such an evil hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) in the hour of explanation with Harriet, as made it impossible for Emma to be ever perfectly at ease.
