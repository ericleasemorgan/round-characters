<p/>Elizabeth had settled it that Mr. Darcy would bring his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister to
visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the very day after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) reaching Pemberley; and was
consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole
of that morning. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) conclusion was false; for on the very
morning after their arrival at Lambton, these visitors came. They
had been walking about the place with some of their new friends,
and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining
with the same family, when the sound of a carriage drew them to a
window, and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving
up the street. Elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery,
guessed what it meant, and imparted no small degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
surprise to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations by acquainting them with the honour
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expected. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt were all amazement; and
the embarrassment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, joined to the
circumstance itself, and many of the circumstances of the
preceding day, opened to them a new idea on the business. Nothing
had ever suggested it before, but they felt that there was no
other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter
than by supposing a partiality for their niece. While these
newly-born notions were passing in their heads, the perturbation
of Elizabeth’s feelings was at every moment increasing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
quite amazed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own discomposure; but amongst other causes of
disquiet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should
have said too much in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favour; and, more than commonly anxious
to please, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) naturally suspected that every power of pleasing
would fail her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) retreated from the window, fearful of being seen; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
walked up and down the room, endeavouring to compose herself, saw
such looks of enquiring surprise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt as made
everything worse.

<p/>Miss Darcy and her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother appeared, and this formidable
introduction took place. With astonishment did Elizabeth see that
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself.
Since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) being at Lambton, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard that Miss Darcy was
exceedingly proud; but the observation of a very few minutes
convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was only exceedingly shy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) found it
difficult to obtain even a word from her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) beyond a monosyllable.

<p/>Miss Darcy was tall, and on a larger scale than Elizabeth; and,
though little more than sixteen, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) figure was formed, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
appearance womanly and graceful. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was less handsome than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
brother; but there was sense and good humour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle. Elizabeth, who had
expected to find in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as acute and unembarrassed an observer as
ever Mr. Darcy had been, was much relieved by discerning such
different feelings.

<p/>They had not long been together before Mr. Darcy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that
Bingley was also coming to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had barely time
to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) satisfaction, and prepare for such a visitor, when
Bingley’s quick step was heard on the stairs, and in a moment he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
entered the room. All Elizabeth’s anger against him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had been long
done away; but had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still felt any, it could hardly have stood
its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>)
expressed himself on seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) again. He (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) enquired in a friendly,
though general way, after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, and looked and spoke with
the same good-humoured ease that he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) had ever done.

<p/>To Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was scarcely a less interesting
personage than to herself. They had long wished to see him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>). The
whole party before them, indeed, excited a lively attention. The
suspicions which had just arisen of Mr. Darcy and their niece
directed their observation towards each with an earnest though
guarded enquiry; and they soon drew from those enquiries the full
conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love. Of
the lady’s sensations they remained a little in doubt; but that
the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough.

<p/>Elizabeth, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side, had much to do. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to ascertain
the feelings of each of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) visitors; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
own, and to make herself agreeable to all; and in the latter
object, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feared most to fail, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was most sure of
success, for those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) endeavoured to give pleasure were
prepossessed in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) favour. Bingley was ready, Georgiana was
eager, and Darcy determined, to be pleased.

<p/>In seeing Bingley, her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) thoughts naturally flew to her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) sister;
and, oh! how ardently did she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) long to know whether any of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
were directed in a like manner. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) could fancy that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
talked less than on former occasions, and once or twice pleased
herself with the notion that, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was trying
to trace a resemblance. But, though this might be imaginary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
could not be deceived as to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) behaviour to Miss Darcy, who had
been set up as a rival to Jane. No look appeared on either side
that spoke particular regard. Nothing occurred between them that
could justify the hopes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister. On this point she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was soon
satisfied; and two or three little circumstances occurred ere
they parted, which, in her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) anxious interpretation, denoted a
recollection of Jane not untinctured by tenderness, and a wish of
saying more that might lead to the mention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), had he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dared.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) observed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), at a moment when the others were talking
together, and in a tone which had something of real regret, that
it <div class="bookquote">"was a very long time since he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had had the pleasure of seeing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>);"  (<font color='red'><b>the others</b></font>)</div>and, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could reply, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) added, "It is above eight
months. We have not met since the 26th of November, when we were
all dancing together at Netherfield."

<p/>Elizabeth was pleased to find his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) memory so exact; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
afterwards took occasion to ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), when unattended to by any of
the rest, whether _all_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sisters were at Longbourn. There was
not much in the question, nor in the preceding remark; but there
was a look and a manner which gave them meaning.

<p/>It was not often that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes on Mr. Darcy
himself; but, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did catch a glimpse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw an
expression of general complaisance, and in all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
heard an accent so removed from _hauteur_ or disdain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
companions, as convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that the improvement of manners
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence
might prove, had at least outlived one day. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thus
seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people
with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a
disgrace—when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thus civil, not only to herself, but to
the very relations whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had openly disdained, and recollected
their last lively scene in Hunsford Parsonage—the difference, the
change was so great, and struck so forcibly on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could hardly restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) astonishment from being visible. Never,
even in the company of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dear friends at Netherfield, or his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
dignified relations at Rosings, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so desirous to
please, so free from self-consequence or unbending reserve, as
now, when no importance could result from the success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
endeavours, and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and
censure of the ladies both of Netherfield and Rosings.

<p/>Their visitors stayed with them above half-an-hour; and when they
arose to depart, Mr. Darcy called on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister to join him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in
expressing their wish of seeing Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner, and Miss
Bennet, to dinner at Pemberley, before they left the country.
Miss Darcy, though with a diffidence which marked her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) little in
the habit of giving invitations, readily obeyed. Mrs. Gardiner
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece, desirous of knowing how _she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)_, whom the
invitation most concerned, felt disposed as to its acceptance,
but Elizabeth had turned away her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) head. Presuming however, that
this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment
than any dislike of the proposal, and seeing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) husband, who
was fond of society, a perfect willingness to accept it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ventured to engage for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) attendance, and the day after the next
was fixed on.

<p/>Bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing
Elizabeth again, having still a great deal to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and
many enquiries to make after all their Hertfordshire friends.
Elizabeth, construing all this into a wish of hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) speak
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, was pleased, and on this account, as well as some
others, found herself, when their visitors left them, capable of
considering the last half-hour with some satisfaction, though
while it was passing, the enjoyment of it had been little. Eager
to be alone, and fearful of enquiries or hints from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and
aunt, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) stayed with them only long enough to hear their
favourable opinion of Bingley, and then hurried away to dress.

<p/>But she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had no reason to fear Mr. and Mrs. Gardiner’s curiosity;
it was not their wish to force her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) communication. It was evident
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was much better acquainted with Mr. Darcy than they had
before any idea of; it was evident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was very much in love
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>). They saw much to interest, but nothing to justify
enquiry.

<p/>Of Mr. Darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well; and,
as far as their acquaintance reached, there was no fault to find.
They could not be untouched by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) politeness; and had they drawn
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) character from their own feelings and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) servant’s report,
without any reference to any other account, the circle in
Hertfordshire to which he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was known would not have recognized it
for Mr. Darcy. There was now an interest, however, in believing
the housekeeper; and they soon became sensible that the authority
of a servant who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) since he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was four years old, and
whose own manners indicated respectability, was not to be hastily
rejected. Neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of
their Lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight.
They had nothing to accuse him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) of but pride; pride he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) probably
had, and if not, it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants
of a small market-town where the family did not visit. It was
acknowledged, however, that he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was a liberal man, and did much
good among the poor.

<p/>With respect to Wickham, the travellers soon found that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was
not held there in much estimation; for though the chief of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
concerns with the son of his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) patron were imperfectly understood,
it was yet a well-known fact that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>) quitting Derbyshire, he (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>)
had left many debts behind him (<font color='blue'><b>chief</b></font>), which Mr. Darcy afterwards
discharged.

<p/>As for Elizabeth, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thoughts were at Pemberley this evening
more than the last; and the evening, though as it passed it
seemed long, was not long enough to determine her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings
towards _one_ in that mansion; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) lay awake two whole hours
endeavouring to make them out. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) certainly did not hate him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).
No; hatred had vanished long ago, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had almost as long been
ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), that could be so
called. The respect created by the conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) valuable
qualities, though at first unwillingly admitted, had for some
time ceased to be repugnant to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feeling; and it was now
heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature, by the testimony
so highly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) favour, and bringing forward his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) disposition in
so amiable a light, which yesterday had produced. But above all,
above respect and esteem, there was a motive within her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of
goodwill which could not be overlooked. It was gratitude;
gratitude, not merely for having once loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), but for loving
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner in rejecting him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and all the unjust accusations
accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rejection. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been persuaded, would
avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) greatest enemy, seemed, on this accidental
meeting, most eager to preserve the acquaintance, and without any
indelicate display of regard, or any peculiarity of manner, where
their two selves only were concerned, was soliciting the good
opinion of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friends, and bent on making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) known to his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
sister. Such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only
astonishment but gratitude—for to love, ardent love, it must be
attributed; and as such its impression on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was of a sort to be
encouraged, as by no means unpleasing, though it could not be
exactly defined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) respected, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) esteemed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was grateful to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt a real interest in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) welfare; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only wanted
to know how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wished that welfare to depend upon herself,
and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should
employ the power, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fancy told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) still possessed,
of bringing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addresses.

<p/>It had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the
niece, that such a striking civility as Miss Darcy’s in coming to
see them on the very day of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) arrival at Pemberley, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
reached it only to a late breakfast, ought to be imitated, though
it could not be equalled, by some exertion of politeness on their
side; and, consequently, that it would be highly expedient to
wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at Pemberley the following morning. They were,
therefore, to go. Elizabeth was pleased; though when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) asked
herself the reason, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had very little to say in reply.

<p/>Mr. Gardiner left them soon after breakfast. The fishing scheme
had been renewed the day before, and a positive engagement made
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meeting some of the gentlemen at Pemberley before noon.
