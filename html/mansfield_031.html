<p/>Henry Crawford was at Mansfield Park again the next morning, and at an
earlier hour than common visiting warrants. The two ladies were
together in the breakfast-room, and, fortunately for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), Lady Bertram
was on the very point of quitting it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) entered. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was almost at
the door, and not chusing by any means to take so much trouble in vain,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) still went on, after a civil reception, a short sentence about
being waited for, and a "Let Sir Thomas know" to the servant.

<p/>Henry, overjoyed to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) go, bowed and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) off, and without
losing another moment, turned instantly to Fanny, and, taking out some
letters, said, with a most animated look, "I must acknowledge myself
infinitely obliged to any creature who gives me such an opportunity of
seeing you alone: I have been wishing it more than you can have any
idea. Knowing as I do what your feelings as a sister are, I could
hardly have borne that any one in the house should share with you in
the first knowledge of the news I now bring. He (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) is made. Your brother
is a lieutenant. I have the infinite satisfaction of congratulating you
on your brother’s promotion. Here are the letters which announce it,
this moment come to hand. You will, perhaps, like to see them."

<p/>Fanny could not speak, but he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) did not want her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to speak. To see the
expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, the change of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) complexion, the progress of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feelings, their doubt, confusion, and felicity, was enough. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
took the letters as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) gave them. The first was from the Admiral to
inform his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) nephew, in a few words, of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) having succeeded in the
object he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had undertaken, the promotion of young Price, and enclosing
two more, one from the Secretary of the First Lord to a friend, whom
the Admiral had set to work in the business, the other from that friend
to himself, by which it appeared that his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) lordship had the very great
happiness of attending to the recommendation of Sir Charles; that Sir
Charles was much delighted in having such an opportunity of proving his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
regard for Admiral Crawford, and that the circumstance of Mr. William
Price’s commission as Second Lieutenant of H.M. Sloop Thrush being made
out was spreading general joy through a wide circle of great people.

<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hand was trembling under these letters, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye running from
one to the other, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart swelling with emotion, Crawford thus
continued, with unfeigned eagerness, to express his (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>) interest in the
event—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will not talk of my own happiness,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Lieutenant</b></font>), "great as it is, for I
think only of yours. Compared with you, who has a right to be happy? I
have almost grudged myself my own prior knowledge of what you ought to
have known before all the world. I have not lost a moment, however. The
post was late this morning, but there has not been since a moment’s
delay. How impatient, how anxious, how wild I have been on the subject,
I will not attempt to describe; how severely mortified, how cruelly
disappointed, in not having it finished while I was in London! I was
kept there from day to day in the hope of it, for nothing less dear to
me than such an object would have detained me half the time from
Mansfield. But though my uncle entered into my wishes with all the
warmth I could desire, and exerted himself immediately, there were
difficulties from the absence of one friend, and the engagements of
another, which at last I could no longer bear to stay the end of, and
knowing in what good hands I left the cause, I came away on Monday,
trusting that many posts would not pass before I should be followed by
such very letters as these. My uncle, who is the very best man in the
world, has exerted himself, as I knew he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would, after seeing your
brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). I would not allow myself yesterday
to say how delighted, or to repeat half that the Admiral said in his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
praise. I deferred it all till his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) praise should be proved the praise
of a friend, as this day _does_ prove it. _Now_ I may say that even I
could not require William Price to excite a greater interest, or be
followed by warmer wishes and higher commendation, than were most
voluntarily bestowed by my uncle after the evening they had passed
together."

<p/>"Has this been all _your_ doing, then?<div class="bookquote">" cried Fanny. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Good heaven! how
very, very kind! Have you really—was it by _your_ desire? I beg your
pardon, but I am bewildered. Did Admiral Crawford apply? How was it? I
am stupefied."

<p/>Henry was most happy to make it more intelligible, by beginning at an
earlier stage, and explaining very particularly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had done. His (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
last journey to London had been undertaken with no other view than that
of introducing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother in Hill Street, and prevailing on the
Admiral to exert whatever interest he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) might have for getting him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) on.
This had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) business. He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) had communicated it to no creature: he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
had not breathed a syllable of it even to Mary; while uncertain of the
issue, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) could not have borne any participation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) feelings, but
this had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) business; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) spoke with such a glow of what his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>)
solicitude had been, and used such strong expressions, was so abounding
in the _deepest_ _interest_, in _twofold_ _motives_, in _views_ _and_
_wishes_ _more_ _than_ _could_ _be_ _told_, that Fanny could not have
remained insensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) drift, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) been able to attend; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
heart was so full and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) senses still so astonished, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
listen but imperfectly even to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) of William, and saying
only when he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) paused, "How kind! how very kind! Oh, Mr. Crawford, we are
infinitely obliged to you! Dearest, dearest William!" She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) jumped up and
moved in haste towards the door, crying out, "I will go to my uncle. My
uncle ought to know it as soon as possible." But this could not be
suffered. The opportunity was too fair, and his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) feelings too impatient.
He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was after her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) immediately. <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must not go, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must allow him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) five
minutes longer,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat, and
was in the middle of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) farther explanation, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had suspected
for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was detained. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did understand it, however, and
found herself expected to believe that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had created sensations which
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) heart had never known before, and that everything he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had done for
William was to be placed to the account of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) excessive and unequalled
attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was exceedingly distressed, and for some moments
unable to speak. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) considered it all as nonsense, as mere trifling
and gallantry, which meant only to deceive for the hour; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not
but feel that it was treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) improperly and unworthily, and in
such a way as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not deserved; but it was like himself, and
entirely of a piece with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had seen before; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not
allow herself to shew half the displeasure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt, because he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had
been conferring an obligation, which no want of delicacy on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) part
could make a trifle to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). While her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was still bounding with joy
and gratitude on William’s behalf, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not be severely resentful
of anything that injured only herself; and after having twice drawn
back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand, and twice attempted in vain to turn away from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
got up, and said only, with much agitation, "Don’t, Mr. Crawford, pray
don’t! I beg you would not. This is a sort of talking which is very
unpleasant to me. I must go away. I cannot bear it." But he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was still
talking on, describing his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) affection, soliciting a return, and,
finally, in words so plain as to bear but one meaning even to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
offering himself, hand, fortune, everything, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acceptance. It was
so; he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had said it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) astonishment and confusion increased; and
though still not knowing how to suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) serious, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could hardly
stand. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) pressed for an answer.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, no, no!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cried, hiding her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face. "This is all nonsense. Do not
distress me. I can hear no more of this. Your kindness to William makes
me more obliged to you than words can express; but I do not want, I
cannot bear, I must not listen to such—No, no, don’t think of me. But
you are _not_ thinking of me. I know it is all nothing."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had burst away from him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and at that moment Sir Thomas was heard
speaking to a servant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) way towards the room they were in. It was
no time for farther assurances or entreaty, though to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at
a moment when her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) modesty alone seemed, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sanguine and preassured
mind, to stand in the way of the happiness he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) sought, was a cruel
necessity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) rushed out at an opposite door from the one her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle
was approaching, and was walking up and down the East room in the
utmost confusion of contrary feeling, before Sir Thomas’s politeness or
apologies were over, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had reached the beginning of the joyful
intelligence which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) visitor came to communicate.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was feeling, thinking, trembling about everything; agitated, happy,
miserable, infinitely obliged, absolutely angry. It was all beyond
belief! He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was inexcusable, incomprehensible! But such were his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) habits
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could do nothing without a mixture of evil. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had previously
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the happiest of human beings, and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had insulted—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knew
not what to say, how to class, or how to regard it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not have
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) be serious, and yet what could excuse the use of such words and
offers, if they meant but to trifle?

<p/>But William was a lieutenant. _That_ was a fact beyond a doubt, and
without an alloy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would think of it for ever and forget all the
rest. Mr. Crawford would certainly never address her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so again: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must
have seen how unwelcome it was to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); and in that case, how gratefully
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could esteem him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) friendship to William!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not stir farther from the East room than the head of the
great staircase, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had satisfied herself of Mr. Crawford’s
having left the house; but when convinced of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
eager to go down and be with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, and have all the happiness of
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) joy as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, and all the benefit of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) information or
his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) conjectures as to what would now be William’s destination. Sir
Thomas was as joyful as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could desire, and very kind and
communicative; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so comfortable a talk with him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) about William
as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel as if nothing had occurred to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
found, towards the close, that Mr. Crawford was engaged to return and
dine there that very day. This was a most unwelcome hearing, for though
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might think nothing of what had passed, it would be quite
distressing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again so soon.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tried to get the better of it; tried very hard, as the dinner hour
approached, to feel and appear as usual; but it was quite impossible
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to look most shy and uncomfortable when their visitor
entered the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not have supposed it in the power of any
concurrence of circumstances to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so many painful sensations on
the first day of hearing of William’s promotion.

<p/>Mr. Crawford was not only in the room—he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was soon close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
a note to deliver from his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister. Fanny could not look at him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), but
there was no consciousness of past folly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) voice. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
note immediately, glad to have anything to do, and happy, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) read
it, to feel that the fidgetings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, who was also to
dine there, screened her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a little from view.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"MY DEAR FANNY,—for so I may now always call you, to the infinite
relief of a tongue that has been stumbling at _Miss_ _Price_ for at
least the last six weeks—I cannot let my brother go without sending you
a few lines of general congratulation, and giving my most joyful
consent and approval. Go on, my dear Fanny, and without fear; there can
be no difficulties worth naming. I chuse to suppose that the assurance
of my consent will be something; so you may smile upon him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) with your
sweetest smiles this afternoon, and send him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) back to me even happier
than he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) goes.


<p/>Yours affectionately,
M. C."


 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>These were not expressions to do Fanny any good; for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) read in
too much haste and confusion to form the clearest judgment of Miss
Crawford’s meaning, it was evident that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother’s attachment, and even to _appear_ to believe it serious.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not know what to do, or what to think. There was wretchedness
in the idea of its being serious; there was perplexity and agitation
every way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was distressed whenever Mr. Crawford spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) much too often; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was afraid there was a
something in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) voice and manner in addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) very different from
what they were when he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talked to the others. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) comfort in that day’s
dinner was quite destroyed: she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly eat anything; and when Sir
Thomas good-humouredly observed that joy had taken away her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) appetite,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was ready to sink with shame, from the dread of Mr. Crawford’s
interpretation; for though nothing could have tempted her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
eyes to the right hand, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sat, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) felt that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ were
immediately directed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was more silent than ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would hardly join even when William
was the subject, for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) commission came all from the right hand too,
and there was pain in the connexion.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thought Lady Bertram sat longer than ever, and began to be in
despair of ever getting away; but at last they were in the
drawing-room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was able to think as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) would, while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) aunts
finished the subject of William’s appointment in their own style.

<p/>Mrs. Norris seemed as much delighted with the saving it would be to Sir
Thomas as with any part of it. "_Now_ William would be able to keep
himself, which would make a vast difference to his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle, for it was
unknown how much he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had cost his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) uncle; and, indeed, it would make some
difference in _her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_ presents too. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was very glad that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had given
William what she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) did at parting, very glad, indeed, that it had been in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) power, without material inconvenience, just at that time to give
him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) something rather considerable; that is, for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_, with _her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)_
limited means, for now it would all be useful in helping to fit up his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
cabin. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) knew he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must be at some expense, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) would have many
things to buy, though to be sure his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) father and mother would be able to
put him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) in the way of getting everything very cheap; but she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was very
glad she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) had contributed her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) mite towards it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am glad you gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) something considerable,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram,
with most unsuspicious calmness, "for _I_ gave him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) only £10."

<p/>"Indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Norris, reddening. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Upon my word, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must have
gone off with his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) pockets well lined, and at no expense for his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) journey
to London either!"

<p/>"Sir Thomas told me £10 would be enough.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Norris, being not at all inclined to question its sufficiency,
began to take the matter in another point.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It is amazing," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), "how much young people cost their friends,
what with bringing them up and putting them out in the world! They
little think how much it comes to, or what their parents, or their
uncles and aunts, pay for them in the course of the year. Now, here are
my sister Price’s children; take them all together, I dare say nobody
would believe what a sum they cost Sir Thomas every year, to say
nothing of what _I_ do for them."

<p/>"Very true, sister, as you say. But, poor things! they cannot help it;
and you know it makes very little difference to Sir Thomas. Fanny,
William must not forget my shawl if he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) goes to the East Indies; and I
shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) a commission for anything else that is worth having. I
wish he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) may go to the East Indies, that I may have my shawl. I think I
will have two shawls, Fanny."

<p/>Fanny, meanwhile, speaking only when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not help it, was very
earnestly trying to understand what Mr. and Miss Crawford were at.
There was everything in the world _against_ their being serious but his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
words and manner. Everything natural, probable, reasonable, was against
it; all their habits and ways of thinking, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own demerits.
How could _she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ have excited serious attachment in a man who had seen
so many, and been admired by so many, and flirted with so many,
infinitely her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) superiors; who seemed so little open to serious
impressions, even where pains had been taken to please him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); who thought
so slightly, so carelessly, so unfeelingly on all such points; who was
everything to everybody, and seemed to find no one essential to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?
And farther, how could it be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sister, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
high and worldly notions of matrimony, would be forwarding anything of
a serious nature in such a quarter? Nothing could be more unnatural in
either. Fanny was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own doubts. Everything might be
possible rather than serious attachment, or serious approbation of it
toward her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had quite convinced herself of this before Sir Thomas
and Mr. Crawford joined them. The difficulty was in maintaining the
conviction quite so absolutely after Mr. Crawford was in the room; for
once or twice a look seemed forced on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not know how to
class among the common meaning; in any other man, at least, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would
have said that it meant something very earnest, very pointed. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
still tried to believe it no more than what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might often have
expressed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins and fifty other women.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was wishing to speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) unheard by the rest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
fancied he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was trying for it the whole evening at intervals, whenever
Sir Thomas was out of the room, or at all engaged with Mrs. Norris, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) carefully refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) every opportunity.

<p/>At last—it seemed an at last to Fanny’s nervousness, though not
remarkably late—he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) began to talk of going away; but the comfort of the
sound was impaired by his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the next moment, and saying,
"Have you nothing to send to Mary? No answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) note? She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) will be
disappointed if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) receives nothing from you. Pray write to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), if it
be only a line."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh yes! certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, rising in haste, the haste of
embarrassment and of wanting to get away—"I will write directly."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went accordingly to the table, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was in the habit of
writing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt, and prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) materials without knowing what
in the world to say. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had read Miss Crawford’s note only once, and
how to reply to anything so imperfectly understood was most
distressing. Quite unpractised in such sort of note-writing, had there
been time for scruples and fears as to style she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have felt them
in abundance: but something must be instantly written; and with only
one decided feeling, that of wishing not to appear to think anything
really intended, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wrote thus, in great trembling both of spirits and
hand—

<p/>"I am very much obliged to you, my dear Miss Crawford, for your kind
congratulations, as far as they relate to my dearest William. The rest
of your note I know means nothing; but I am so unequal to anything of
the sort, that I hope you will excuse my begging you to take no farther
notice. I have seen too much of Mr. Crawford not to understand his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
manners; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) understood me as well, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would, I dare say, behave
differently. I do not know what I write, but it would be a great favour
of you never to mention the subject again. With thanks for the honour
of your note,


<p/>I remain, dear Miss Crawford,
&c., &c.<div class="bookquote">"


<p/>The conclusion was scarcely intelligible from increasing fright, for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found that Mr. Crawford, under pretence of receiving the note, was
coming towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>You cannot think I mean to hurry you," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), in an undervoice,
perceiving the amazing trepidation with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) made up the note,
"you cannot think I have any such object. Do not hurry yourself, I
entreat."

<p/>"Oh! I thank you; I have quite done, just done; it will be ready in a
moment; I am very much obliged to you; if you will be so good as to
give _that_ to Miss Crawford."

<p/>The note was held out, and must be taken; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) instantly and with
averted eyes walked towards the fireplace, where sat the others, he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) had
nothing to do but to go in good earnest.

<p/>Fanny thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never known a day of greater agitation, both of
pain and pleasure; but happily the pleasure was not of a sort to die
with the day; for every day would restore the knowledge of William’s
advancement, whereas the pain, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hoped, would return no more. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had
no doubt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) note must appear excessively ill-written, that the
language would disgrace a child, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) distress had allowed no
arrangement; but at least it would assure them both of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being
neither imposed on nor gratified by Mr. Crawford’s attentions.
