<p/>Other opportunities of making her observations could not fail to occur.
Anne had soon been in company with all the four together often enough
to have an opinion, though too wise to acknowledge as much at home,
where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew it would have satisfied neither husband nor wife; for
while she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) considered Louisa to be rather the favourite, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not
but think, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might dare to judge from memory and
experience, that Captain Wentworth was not in love with either.  They
were more in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); yet there it was not love.  It was a little
fever of admiration; but it might, probably must, end in love with
some.  Charles Hayter seemed aware of being slighted, and yet Henrietta
had sometimes the air of being divided between them.  Anne longed for
the power of representing to them all what they were about, and of
pointing out some of the evils they were exposing themselves to.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
did not attribute guile to any.  It was the highest satisfaction to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
to believe Captain Wentworth not in the least aware of the pain he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was
occasioning.  There was no triumph, no pitiful triumph in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) manner.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had, probably, never heard, and never thought of any claims of
Charles Hayter.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) was only wrong in accepting the attentions (for
accepting must be the word) of two young women at once.

<p/>After a short struggle, however, Charles Hayter seemed to quit the
field.  Three days had passed without his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) coming once to Uppercross; a
most decided change.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) had even refused one regular invitation to
dinner; and having been found on the occasion by Mr Musgrove with some
large books before him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), Mr and Mrs Musgrove were sure all could not be
right, and talked, with grave faces, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) studying himself to death.
It was Mary's hope and belief that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>) had received a positive dismissal
from Henrietta, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) husband lived under the constant dependence of
seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-morrow.  Anne could only feel that Charles Hayter was
wise.

<p/>One morning, about this time Charles Musgrove and Captain Wentworth
being gone a-shooting together, as the sisters in the Cottage were
sitting quietly at work, they were visited at the window by the sisters
from the Mansion-house.

<p/>It was a very fine November day, and the Miss Musgroves came through
the little grounds, and stopped for no other purpose than to say, that
they were going to take a long walk, and therefore concluded Mary could
not like to go with them; and when Mary immediately replied, with some
jealousy at not being supposed a good walker, "Oh, yes, I should like
to join you very much, I am very fond of a long walk;" Anne felt
persuaded, by the looks of the two girls, that it was precisely what
they did not wish, and admired again the sort of necessity which the
family habits seemed to produce, of everything being to be
communicated, and everything being to be done together, however
undesired and inconvenient.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) tried to dissuade Mary from going, but
in vain; and that being the case, thought it best to accept the Miss
Musgroves' much more cordial invitation to herself to go likewise, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) might be useful in turning back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) sister, and lessening the
interference in any plan of their own.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot imagine why they should suppose I should not like a long
walk,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) went up stairs.  "Everybody is always
supposing that I am not a good walker; and yet they would not have been
pleased, if we had refused to join them.  When people come in this
manner on purpose to ask us, how can one say no?"

<p/>Just as they were setting off, the gentlemen returned.  They had taken
out a young dog, who had spoilt their sport, and sent them back early.
Their time and strength, and spirits, were, therefore, exactly ready
for this walk, and they entered into it with pleasure.  Could Anne have
foreseen such a junction, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have staid at home; but, from some
feelings of interest and curiosity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fancied now that it was too
late to retract, and the whole six set forward together in the
direction chosen by the Miss Musgroves, who evidently considered the
walk as under their guidance.

<p/>Anne's object was, not to be in the way of anybody; and where the
narrow paths across the fields made many separations necessary, to keep
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) pleasure in the walk must arise from
the exercise and the day, from the view of the last smiles of the year
upon the tawny leaves, and withered hedges, and from repeating to
herself some few of the thousand poetical descriptions extant of
autumn, that season of peculiar and inexhaustible influence on the mind
of taste and tenderness, that season which had drawn from every poet,
worthy of being read, some attempt at description, or some lines of
feeling.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) occupied her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind as much as possible in such like
musings and quotations; but it was not possible, that when within reach
of Captain Wentworth's conversation with either of the Miss Musgroves,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) should not try to hear it; yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) caught little very remarkable.
It was mere lively chat, such as any young persons, on an intimate
footing, might fall into.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was more engaged with Louisa than with
Henrietta.  Louisa certainly put more forward for his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) notice than her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
sister.  This distinction appeared to increase, and there was one
speech of Louisa's which struck her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).  After one of the many praises of
the day, which were continually bursting forth, Captain Wentworth
added:--

<p/>"What glorious weather for the Admiral and my sister!  They meant to
take a long drive this morning; perhaps we may hail them from some of
these hills.  They talked of coming into this side of the country.  I
wonder whereabouts they will upset to-day.  Oh! it does happen very
often, I assure you; but my sister makes nothing of it; she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would as
lieve be tossed out as not."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah! You make the most of it, I know,"  (<font color='red'><b>Louisa</b></font>)</div>cried Louisa, "but if it were
really so, I should do just the same in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) place.  If I loved a man,
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) loves the Admiral, I would always be with him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), nothing should
ever separate us, and I would rather be overturned by him (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), than driven
safely by anybody else.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>It was spoken with enthusiasm.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Had you?" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>), catching the same tone; "I honour you!" And there
was silence between them for a little while.

<p/>Anne could not immediately fall into a quotation again.  The sweet
scenes of autumn were for a while put by, unless some tender sonnet,
fraught with the apt analogy of the declining year, with declining
happiness, and the images of youth and hope, and spring, all gone
together, blessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) memory.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) roused herself to say, as they
struck by order into another path, <div class="bookquote">"Is not this one of the ways to
Winthrop?"  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>But nobody heard, or, at least, nobody answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>Winthrop, however, or its environs--for young men are, sometimes to be
met with, strolling about near home--was their destination; and after
another half mile of gradual ascent through large enclosures, where the
ploughs at work, and the fresh made path spoke the farmer counteracting
the sweets of poetical despondence, and meaning to have spring again,
they gained the summit of the most considerable hill, which parted
Uppercross and Winthrop, and soon commanded a full view of the latter,
at the foot of the hill on the other side.

<p/>Winthrop, without beauty and without dignity, was stretched before them;
an indifferent house, standing low, and hemmed in by the barns and
buildings of a farm-yard.

<p/>Mary exclaimed, "Bless me! here is Winthrop.  I declare I had no idea!
Well now, I think we had better turn back; I am excessively tired."

<p/>Henrietta, conscious and ashamed, and seeing no cousin Charles walking
along any path, or leaning against any gate, was ready to do as Mary
wished; but <div class="bookquote">"No!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Charles Musgrove, and "No, no!" cried Louisa
more eagerly, and taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister aside, seemed to be arguing the
matter warmly.

<p/>Charles, in the meanwhile, was very decidedly declaring his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) resolution
of calling on his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) aunt, now that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was so near; and very evidently,
though more fearfully, trying to induce his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife to go too.  But this
was one of the points on which the lady shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) strength; and when
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) recommended the advantage of resting herself a quarter of an hour at
Winthrop, as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) felt so tired, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) resolutely answered, <div class="bookquote">"Oh! no,
indeed! walking up that hill again would do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) more harm than any
sitting down could do her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) good;"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and, in short, her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) look and manner
declared, that go she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) would not.

<p/>After a little succession of these sort of debates and consultations,
it was settled between Charles and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) two sisters, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) and
Henrietta should just run down for a few minutes, to see their aunt and
cousins, while the rest of the party waited for them at the top of the
hill.  Louisa seemed the principal arranger of the plan; and, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
went a little way with them, down the hill, still talking to Henrietta,
Mary took the opportunity of looking scornfully around her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), and saying
to Captain Wentworth--

<p/>"It is very unpleasant, having such connexions!  But, I assure you, I
have never been in the house above twice in my life."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) received no other answer, than an artificial, assenting smile,
followed by a contemptuous glance, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) turned away, which Anne
perfectly knew the meaning of.

<p/>The brow of the hill, where they remained, was a cheerful spot: Louisa
returned; and Mary, finding a comfortable seat for herself on the step
of a stile, was very well satisfied so long as the others all stood
about her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); but when Louisa drew Captain Wentworth away, to try for a
gleaning of nuts in an adjoining hedge-row, and they were gone by
degrees quite out of sight and sound, Mary was happy no longer; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
quarrelled with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own seat, was sure Louisa had got a much better
somewhere, and nothing could prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) from going to look for a
better also.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) turned through the same gate, but could not see them.
Anne found a nice seat for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), on a dry sunny bank, under the
hedge-row, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had no doubt of their still being, in some spot
or other.  Mary sat down for a moment, but it would not do; she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was
sure Louisa had found a better seat somewhere else, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) would go on
till she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) overtook her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>).

<p/>Anne, really tired herself, was glad to sit down; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) very soon
heard Captain Wentworth and Louisa in the hedge-row, behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), as if
making their way back along the rough, wild sort of channel, down the
centre.  They were speaking as they drew near.  Louisa's voice was the
first distinguished.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) seemed to be in the middle of some eager
speech.  What Anne first heard was--

<p/>"And so, I made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) go.  I could not bear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should be frightened
from the visit by such nonsense.  What! would I be turned back from
doing a thing that I had determined to do, and that I knew to be right,
by the airs and interference of such a person, or of any person I may
say?  No, I have no idea of being so easily persuaded.  When I have
made up my mind, I have made it; and Henrietta seemed entirely to have
made up hers to call at Winthrop to-day; and yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) was as near
giving it up, out of nonsensical complaisance!"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would have turned back then, but for you?"

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would indeed.  I am almost ashamed to say it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Happy for her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>), to have such a mind as yours at hand!  After the hints
you gave just now, which did but confirm my own observations, the last
time I was in company with him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>),  I need not affect to have no
comprehension of what is going on.  I see that more than a mere dutiful
morning visit to your aunt was in question; and woe betide him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>)
too, when it comes to things of consequence, when they are placed in
circumstances requiring fortitude and strength of mind, if she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) have not
resolution enough to resist idle interference in such a trifle as this.
Your sister is an amiable creature; but yours is the character of
decision and firmness, I see.  If you value her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) conduct or happiness,
infuse as much of your own spirit into her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) as you can.  But this, no
doubt, you have been always doing.  It is the worst evil of too
yielding and indecisive a character, that no influence over it can be
depended on.  You are never sure of a good impression being durable;
everybody may sway it.  Let those who would be happy be firm.  Here is
a nut,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), catching one down from an upper bough, "to exemplify:
a beautiful glossy nut, which, blessed with original strength, has
outlived all the storms of autumn.  Not a puncture, not a weak spot
anywhere.  This nut," he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) continued, with playful solemnity, "while so
many of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) brethren have fallen and been trodden under foot, is still
in possession of all the happiness that a hazel nut can be supposed
capable of."  Then returning to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) former earnest tone--"My first
wish for all whom I am interested in, is that they should be firm.  If
Louisa Musgrove would be beautiful and happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) November of life,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) will cherish all her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) present powers of mind."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had done, and was unanswered.  It would have surprised Anne if
Louisa could have readily answered such a speech:  words of such
interest, spoken with such serious warmth!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) could imagine what
Louisa was feeling.  For herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) feared to move, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) should
be seen.  While she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) remained, a bush of low rambling holly protected
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), and they were moving on.  Before they were beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) hearing,
however, Louisa spoke again.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Mary is good-natured enough in many respects,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); "but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does
sometimes provoke me excessively, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) nonsense and pride--the Elliot
pride.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has a great deal too much of the Elliot pride.  We do so
wish that Charles had married Anne instead.  I suppose you know he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
wanted to marry Anne?"

<p/>After a moment's pause, Captain Wentworth said--

<p/>"Do you mean that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Oh! yes; certainly."

<p/>"When did that happen?"

<p/>"I do not exactly know, for Henrietta and I were at school at the time;
but I believe about a year before he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) married Mary.  I wish she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had
accepted him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).  We should all have liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a great deal better; and
papa and mamma always think it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) great friend Lady Russell's
doing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) did not.  They think Charles might not be learned and
bookish enough to please Lady Russell, and that therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
persuaded Anne to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)."

<p/>The sounds were retreating, and Anne distinguished no more.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own
emotions still kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) fixed.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had much to recover from, before
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could move.  The listener's proverbial fate was not absolutely
hers; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard no evil of herself, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard a great deal
of very painful import.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw how her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own character was considered
by Captain Wentworth, and there had been just that degree of feeling
and curiosity about her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) manner which must give her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) extreme
agitation.

<p/>As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) went after Mary, and having found, and walked
back with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to their former station, by the stile, felt some comfort
in their whole party being immediately afterwards collected, and once
more in motion together.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) spirits wanted the solitude and silence
which only numbers could give.

<p/>Charles and Henrietta returned, bringing, as may be conjectured,
Charles Hayter with them.  The minutiae of the business Anne could not
attempt to understand; even Captain Wentworth did not seem admitted to
perfect confidence here; but that there had been a withdrawing on the
gentleman's side, and a relenting on the lady's, and that they were now
very glad to be together again, did not admit a doubt.  Henrietta
looked a little ashamed, but very well pleased;--Charles Hayter
exceedingly happy:  and they were devoted to each other almost from the
first instant of their all setting forward for Uppercross.

<p/>Everything now marked out Louisa for Captain Wentworth; nothing could
be plainer; and where many divisions were necessary, or even where they
were not, they walked side by side nearly as much as the other two.  In
a long strip of meadow land, where there was ample space for all, they
were thus divided, forming three distinct parties; and to that party of
the three which boasted least animation, and least complaisance, Anne
necessarily belonged.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) joined Charles and Mary, and was tired
enough to be very glad of Charles's other arm; but Charles, though in
very good humour with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), was out of temper with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife.  Mary had
shewn herself disobliging to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and was now to reap the consequence,
which consequence was his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dropping her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) arm almost every moment to cut
off the heads of some nettles in the hedge with his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) switch; and when
Mary began to complain of it, and lament her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) being ill-used, according
to custom, in being on the hedge side, while Anne was never incommoded
on the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dropped the arms of both to hunt after a weasel which
he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had a momentary glance of, and they could hardly get him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) along at
all.

<p/>This long meadow bordered a lane, which their footpath, at the end of
it was to cross, and when the party had all reached the gate of exit,
the carriage advancing in the same direction, which had been some time
heard, was just coming up, and proved to be Admiral Croft's gig.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife had taken their intended drive, and were returning home.
Upon hearing how long a walk the young people had engaged in, they
kindly offered a seat to any lady who might be particularly tired; it
would save her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) a full mile, and they were going through Uppercross.
The invitation was general, and generally declined.  The Miss Musgroves
were not at all tired, and Mary was either offended, by not being asked
before any of the others, or what Louisa called the Elliot pride could
not endure to make a third in a one horse chaise.

<p/>The walking party had crossed the lane, and were surmounting an
opposite stile, and the Admiral was putting his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) horse in motion again,
when Captain Wentworth cleared the hedge in a moment to say something
to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sister.  The something might be guessed by its effects.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Elliot, I am sure you are tired,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs Croft.  "Do let us
have the pleasure of taking you home.  Here is excellent room for
three, I assure you.  If we were all like you, I believe we might sit
four.  You must, indeed, you must."

<p/>Anne was still in the lane; and though instinctively beginning to
decline, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was not allowed to proceed.  The Admiral's kind urgency
came in support of his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) wife's; they would not be refused; they
compressed themselves into the smallest possible space to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) a
corner, and Captain Wentworth, without saying a word, turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>),
and quietly obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) to be assisted into the carriage.

<p/>Yes; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had done it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was in the carriage, and felt that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
placed her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) there, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) will and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hands had done it, that she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
owed it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) perception of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) fatigue, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) resolution to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) rest.  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was very much affected by the view of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) disposition
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), which all these things made apparent.  This little
circumstance seemed the completion of all that had gone before.  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not be
unfeeling.  Though condemning her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) for the past, and considering it with
high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), and
though becoming attached to another, still he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) suffer,
without the desire of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) relief.  It was a remainder of former
sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship;
it was a proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own warm and amiable heart, which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) could not
contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) knew not which prevailed.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) answers to the kindness and the remarks of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) companions were at
first unconsciously given.  They had travelled half their way along the
rough lane, before she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was quite awake to what they said.  She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) then
found them talking of <div class="bookquote">"Frederick."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) certainly means to have one or other of those two girls, Sophy,"
 (<font color='red'><b>the Admiral</b></font>)</div>said the Admiral; "but there is no saying which.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) has been running
after them, too, long enough, one would think, to make up his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) mind.
Ay, this comes of the peace.  If it were war now, he (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) would have settled
it long ago.  We sailors, Miss Elliot, cannot afford to make long
courtships in time of war.  How many days was it, my dear, between the
first time of my seeing you and our sitting down together in our
lodgings at North Yarmouth?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We had better not talk about it, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>replied Mrs Croft,
pleasantly; "for if Miss Elliot were to hear how soon we came to an
understanding, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would never be persuaded that we could be happy
together.  I had known you by character, however, long before."

<p/>"Well, and I had heard of you as a very pretty girl, and what were we
to wait for besides?  I do not like having such things so long in hand.
I wish Frederick would spread a little more canvass, and bring us home
one of these young ladies to Kellynch.  Then there would always be
company for them.  And very nice young ladies they both are; I hardly
know one from the other."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very good humoured, unaffected girls, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft/Croft</b></font>)</div>said Mrs Croft, in a
tone of calmer praise, such as made Anne suspect that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) keener powers
might not consider either of them as quite worthy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother; "and
