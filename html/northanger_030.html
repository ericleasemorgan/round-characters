<p/>Catherine was too wretched to be fearful. The journey in itself had no
terrors for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) began it without either dreading its length or
feeling its solitariness. Leaning back in one corner of the carriage,
in a violent burst of tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was conveyed some miles beyond the
walls of the abbey before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) raised her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) head; and the highest point of
ground within the park was almost closed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) view before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
capable of turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes towards it. Unfortunately, the road she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) now
travelled was the same which only ten days ago she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had so happily
passed along in going to and from Woodston; and, for fourteen miles,
every bitter feeling was rendered more severe by the review of objects
on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had first looked under impressions so different. Every
mile, as it brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) nearer Woodston, added to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sufferings, and
when within the distance of five, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) passed the turning which led to
it, and thought of Henry, so near, yet so unconscious, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) grief and
agitation were excessive.

<p/>The day which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had spent at that place had been one of the happiest
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) life. It was there, it was on that day, that the general had
made use of such expressions with regard to Henry and herself, had so
spoken and so looked as to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) the most positive conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
actually wishing their marriage. Yes, only ten days ago had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) elated
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) pointed regard—had he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) even confused her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) too
significant reference! And now—what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) done, or what had she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
omitted to do, to merit such a change?

<p/>The only offence against him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) of which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could accuse herself had been
such as was scarcely possible to reach his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) knowledge. Henry and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
heart only were privy to the shocking suspicions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had so idly
entertained; and equally safe did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) secret with each.
Designedly, at least, Henry could not have betrayed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). If, indeed, by
any strange mischance his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father should have gained intelligence of
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had dared to think and look for, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) causeless fancies and
injurious examinations, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not wonder at any degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
indignation. If aware of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) having viewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as a murderer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could
not wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) even turning her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) from his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) house. But a justification
so full of torture to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) trusted, would not be in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) power.

<p/>Anxious as were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) conjectures on this point, it was not, however,
the one on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dwelt most. There was a thought yet nearer, a more
prevailing, more impetuous concern. How Henry would think, and feel,
and look, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) returned on the morrow to Northanger and heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
being gone, was a question of force and interest to rise over every
other, to be never ceasing, alternately irritating and soothing; it
sometimes suggested the dread of his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) calm acquiescence, and at others
was answered by the sweetest confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) regret and resentment.
To the general, of course, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) would not dare to speak; but to
Eleanor—what might he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) not say to Eleanor about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)?

<p/>In this unceasing recurrence of doubts and inquiries, on any one
article of which her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind was incapable of more than momentary repose,
the hours passed away, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) journey advanced much faster than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
looked for. The pressing anxieties of thought, which prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) from
noticing anything before her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>), when once beyond the neighbourhood of
Woodston, saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) at the same time from watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) progress; and
though no object on the road could engage a moment’s attention, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
found no stage of it tedious. From this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was preserved too by
another cause, by feeling no eagerness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) journey’s conclusion;
for to return in such a manner to Fullerton was almost to destroy the
pleasure of a meeting with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) loved best, even after an absence
such as hers—an eleven weeks’ absence. What had she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to say that would
not humble herself and pain her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) family, that would not increase her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) own
grief by the confession of it, extend an useless resentment, and
perhaps involve the innocent with the guilty in undistinguishing ill
will? She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could never do justice to Henry and Eleanor’s merit; she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) felt
it too strongly for expression; and should a dislike be taken against
them, should they be thought of unfavourably, on their father’s
account, it would cut her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to the heart.

<p/>With these feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) rather dreaded than sought for the first view
of that well-known spire which would announce her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) within twenty miles
of home. Salisbury she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had known to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) point on leaving Northanger;
but after the first stage she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) had been indebted to the post-masters for
the names of the places which were then to conduct her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) to it; so great
had been her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) ignorance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) route. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) met with nothing, however, to
distress or frighten her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) youth, civil manners, and liberal pay
procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) all the attention that a traveller like herself could
require; and stopping only to change horses, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) travelled on for about
eleven hours without accident or alarm, and between six and seven
o’clock in the evening found herself entering Fullerton.

<p/>A heroine returning, at the close of her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) career, to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) native village,
in all the triumph of recovered reputation, and all the dignity of a
countess, with a long train of noble relations in their several
phaetons, and three waiting-maids in a travelling chaise and four,
behind her (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>), is an event on which the pen of the contriver may well
delight to dwell; it gives credit to every conclusion, and the author
must share in the glory she (<font color='blue'><b>countess</b></font>) so liberally bestows. But my affair is
widely different; I bring back my heroine to her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) home in solitude and
disgrace; and no sweet elation of spirits can lead me into minuteness.
A heroine in a hack post-chaise is such a blow upon sentiment, as no
attempt at grandeur or pathos can withstand. Swiftly therefore shall
her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) post-boy drive through the village, amid the gaze of Sunday groups,
and speedy shall be her (<font color='blue'><b>heroine</b></font>) descent from it.

<p/>But, whatever might be the distress of Catherine’s mind, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thus
advanced towards the parsonage, and whatever the humiliation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
biographer in relating it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was preparing enjoyment of no everyday
nature for those to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) went; first, in the appearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
carriage—and secondly, in herself. The chaise of a traveller being a
rare sight in Fullerton, the whole family were immediately at the
window; and to have it stop at the sweep-gate was a pleasure to
brighten every eye and occupy every fancy—a pleasure quite unlooked for
by all but the two youngest children, a boy and girl of six and four
years old, who expected a brother or sister in every carriage. Happy
the glance that first distinguished Catherine! Happy the voice that
proclaimed the discovery! But whether such happiness were the lawful
property of George or Harriet could never be exactly understood.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, mother, Sarah, George, and Harriet, all assembled at the
door to welcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with affectionate eagerness, was a sight to awaken
the best feelings of Catherine’s heart; and in the embrace of each, as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) stepped from the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) found herself soothed beyond
anything that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had believed possible. So surrounded, so caressed,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was even happy! In the joyfulness of family love everything for a
short time was subdued, and the pleasure of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), leaving them at
first little leisure for calm curiosity, they were all seated round the
tea-table, which Mrs. Morland had hurried for the comfort of the poor
traveller, whose pale and jaded looks soon caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) notice, before
any inquiry so direct as to demand a positive answer was addressed to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>).

<p/>Reluctantly, and with much hesitation, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) then begin what might
perhaps, at the end of half an hour, be termed, by the courtesy of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
hearers, an explanation; but scarcely, within that time, could they at
all discover the cause, or collect the particulars, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) sudden
return. They were far from being an irritable race; far from any
quickness in catching, or bitterness in resenting, affronts: but here,
when the whole was unfolded, was an insult not to be overlooked, nor,
for the first half hour, to be easily pardoned. Without suffering any
romantic alarm, in the consideration of their daughter’s long and
lonely journey, Mr. and Mrs. Morland could not but feel that it might
have been productive of much unpleasantness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>); that it was what
they could never have voluntarily suffered; and that, in forcing her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) on
such a measure, General Tilney had acted neither honourably nor
feelingly—neither as a gentleman nor as a parent. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had done it,
what could have provoked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to such a breach of hospitality, and so
suddenly turned all his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) partial regard for their daughter into actual
ill will, was a matter which they were at least as far from divining as
Catherine herself; but it did not oppress them by any means so long;
and, after a due course of useless conjecture, that <div class="bookquote">"it was a strange
business, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) must be a very strange man,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>grew enough for all
their indignation and wonder; though Sarah indeed still indulged in the
sweets of incomprehensibility, exclaiming and conjecturing with
youthful ardour. <div class="bookquote">"My dear, you give yourself a great deal of needless
trouble,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Sarah</b></font>) mother at last; <div class="bookquote">"depend upon it, it is something not
at all worth understanding."

 (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I can allow for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) wishing Catherine away, when he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) recollected this
engagement,"  (<font color='red'><b>Sarah</b></font>)</div>said Sarah, "but why not do it civilly?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sorry for the young people,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>returned Mrs. Morland; <div class="bookquote">"they must
have a sad time of it; but as for anything else, it is no matter now;
Catherine is safe at home, and our comfort does not depend upon General
Tilney."  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>Catherine sighed. "Well," continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) philosophic mother, "I
am glad I did not know of your journey at the time; but now it is all
over, perhaps there is no great harm done. It is always good for young
people to be put upon exerting themselves; and you know, my dear
Catherine, you always were a sad little scatter-brained creature; but
now you must have been forced to have your wits about you, with so much
changing of chaises and so forth; and I hope it will appear that you
have not left anything behind you in any of the pockets."

<p/>Catherine hoped so too, and tried to feel an interest in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own
amendment, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits were quite worn down; and, to be silent and
alone becoming soon her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) only wish, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) readily agreed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother’s
next counsel of going early to bed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) parents, seeing nothing in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ill looks and agitation but the natural consequence of mortified
feelings, and of the unusual exertion and fatigue of such a journey,
parted from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) without any doubt of their being soon slept away; and
though, when they all met the next morning, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) recovery was not equal
to their hopes, they were still perfectly unsuspicious of there being
any deeper evil. They never once thought of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart, which, for the
parents of a young lady of seventeen, just returned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first
excursion from home, was odd enough!

<p/>As soon as breakfast was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat down to fulfil her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) promise to
Miss Tilney, whose trust in the effect of time and distance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
friend’s disposition was already justified, for already did Catherine
reproach herself with having parted from Eleanor coldly, with having
never enough valued her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) merits or kindness, and never enough
commiserated her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been yesterday left to endure. The
strength of these feelings, however, was far from assisting her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pen;
and never had it been harder for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to write than in addressing
Eleanor Tilney. To compose a letter which might at once do justice to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) sentiments and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) situation, convey gratitude without servile
regret, be guarded without coldness, and honest without resentment—a
letter which Eleanor might not be pained by the perusal of—and, above
all, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) might not blush herself, if Henry should chance to see,
was an undertaking to frighten away all her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) powers of performance; and,
after long thought and much perplexity, to be very brief was all that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could determine on with any confidence of safety. The money
therefore which Eleanor had advanced was enclosed with little more than
grateful thanks, and the thousand good wishes of a most affectionate
heart.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This has been a strange acquaintance,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Morland</b></font>)</div>observed Mrs. Morland, as the
letter was finished; "soon made and soon ended. I am sorry it happens
so, for Mrs. Allen thought them very pretty kind of young people; and
you were sadly out of luck too in your Isabella. Ah! Poor James! Well,
we must live and learn; and the next new friends you make I hope will
be better worth keeping."

<p/>Catherine coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) warmly answered, "No friend can be better
worth keeping than Eleanor."

<p/>"If so, my dear, I dare say you will meet again some time or other; do
not be uneasy. It is ten to one but you are thrown together again in
the course of a few years; and then what a pleasure it will be!"

<p/>Mrs. Morland was not happy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) attempt at consolation. The hope of
meeting again in the course of a few years could only put into
Catherine’s head what might happen within that time to make a meeting
dreadful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could never forget Henry Tilney, or think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
with less tenderness than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did at that moment; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) might forget
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); and in that case, to meet—! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes filled with tears as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
pictured her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) acquaintance so renewed; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
comfortable suggestions to have had no good effect, proposed, as
another expedient for restoring her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits, that they should call on
Mrs. Allen.

<p/>The two houses were only a quarter of a mile apart; and, as they
walked, Mrs. Morland quickly dispatched all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) felt on the score
of James’s disappointment. <div class="bookquote">"We are sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>); "but
otherwise there is no harm done in the match going off; for it could
not be a desirable thing to have him (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) engaged to a girl whom we had not
the smallest acquaintance with, and who was so entirely without
fortune; and now, after such behaviour, we cannot think at all well of
her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>). Just at present it comes hard to poor James; but that will not
last forever; and I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will be a discreeter man all his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) life,
for the foolishness of his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) first choice."

<p/>This was just such a summary view of the affair as Catherine could
listen to; another sentence might have endangered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) complaisance, and
made her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) reply less rational; for soon were all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thinking powers
swallowed up in the reflection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own change of feelings and
spirits since last she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had trodden that well-known road. It was not
three months ago since, wild with joyful expectation, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had there run
backwards and forwards some ten times a day, with an heart light, gay,
and independent; looking forward to pleasures untasted and unalloyed,
and free from the apprehension of evil as from the knowledge of it.
Three months ago had seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) all this; and now, how altered a being
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) return!

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was received by the Allens with all the kindness which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
unlooked-for appearance, acting on a steady affection, would naturally
call forth; and great was their surprise, and warm their displeasure,
on hearing how she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had been treated—though Mrs. Morland’s account of it
was no inflated representation, no studied appeal to their passions.
<div class="bookquote">"Catherine took us quite by surprise yesterday evening,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). "She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
travelled all the way post by herself, and knew nothing of coming till
Saturday night; for General Tilney, from some odd fancy or other, all
of a sudden grew tired of having her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) there, and almost turned her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) out
of the house. Very unfriendly, certainly; and he (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) must be a very odd
man; but we are so glad to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) amongst us again! And it is a great
comfort to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is not a poor helpless creature, but can shift
very well for herself."

<p/>Mr. Allen expressed himself on the occasion with the reasonable
resentment of a sensible friend; and Mrs. Allen thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) expressions
quite good enough to be immediately made use of again by herself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
wonder, his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) conjectures, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) explanations became in succession
hers, with the addition of this single remark—"I really have not
patience with the general"—to fill up every accidental pause. And, <div class="bookquote">"I
really have not patience with the general,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Allen</b></font>)</div>was uttered twice after Mr.
Allen left the room, without any relaxation of anger, or any material
digression of thought. A more considerable degree of wandering attended
the third repetition; and, after completing the fourth, she (<font color='blue'><b>herself</b></font>) immediately
added, "Only think, my dear, of my having got that frightful great rent
in my best Mechlin so charmingly mended, before I left Bath, that one
can hardly see where it was. I must show it you some day or other. Bath
is a nice place, Catherine, after all. I assure you I did not above
half like coming away. Mrs. Thorpe’s being there was such a comfort to
us, was not it? You know, you and I were quite forlorn at first."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, but _that_ did not last long,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes
brightening at the recollection of what had first given spirit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
existence there.

<p/>"Very true: we soon met with Mrs. Thorpe, and then we wanted for
nothing. My dear, do not you think these silk gloves wear very well? I
put them on new the first time of our going to the Lower Rooms, you
know, and I have worn them a great deal since. Do you remember that
evening?"

<p/>"Do I! Oh! Perfectly."

<p/>"It was very agreeable, was not it? Mr. Tilney drank tea with us, and I
always thought him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) a great addition, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) is so very agreeable. I have a
notion you danced with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), but am not quite sure. I remember I had my
favourite gown on."

<p/>Catherine could not answer; and, after a short trial of other subjects,
Mrs. Allen again returned to—"I really have not patience with the
general! Such an agreeable, worthy man as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) seemed to be! I do not
suppose, Mrs. Morland, you ever saw a better-bred man in your life. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
lodgings were taken the very day after he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) left them, Catherine. But no
wonder; Milsom Street, you know."

<p/>As they walked home again, Mrs. Morland endeavoured to impress on her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>)
daughter’s mind the happiness of having such steady well-wishers as Mr.
and Mrs. Allen, and the very little consideration which the neglect or
unkindness of slight acquaintance like the Tilneys ought to have with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>), while she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) could preserve the good opinion and affection of her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
earliest friends. There was a great deal of good sense in all this; but
there are some situations of the human mind in which good sense has
very little power; and Catherine’s feelings contradicted almost every
position her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) mother advanced. It was upon the behaviour of these very
slight acquaintance that all her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) present happiness depended; and while
Mrs. Morland was successfully confirming her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own opinions by the
justness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) own representations, Catherine was silently reflecting
that _now_ Henry must have arrived at Northanger; _now_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must have
heard of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) departure; and _now_, perhaps, they were all setting off
for Hereford.
