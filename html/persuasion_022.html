<p/>Anne went home to think over all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard.  In one point, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
feelings were relieved by this knowledge of Mr Elliot.  There was no
longer anything of tenderness due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) stood as opposed to
Captain Wentworth, in all his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) own unwelcome obtrusiveness; and the evil
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) attentions last night, the irremediable mischief he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might have
done, was considered with sensations unqualified, unperplexed.  Pity
for him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was all over.  But this was the only point of relief.  In every
other respect, in looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), or penetrating forward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw
more to distrust and to apprehend.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was concerned for the
disappointment and pain Lady Russell would be feeling; for the
mortifications which must be hanging over her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father and sister, and
had all the distress of foreseeing many evils, without knowing how to
avert any one of them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was most thankful for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own knowledge of
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had never considered herself as entitled to reward for not
slighting an old friend like Mrs Smith, but here was a reward indeed
springing from it!  Mrs Smith had been able to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) what no one
else could have done.  Could the knowledge have been extended through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) family?  But this was a vain idea.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must talk to Lady Russell,
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), consult with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), and having done her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) best, wait the event
with as much composure as possible; and after all, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) greatest want of
composure would be in that quarter of the mind which could not be
opened to Lady Russell; in that flow of anxieties and fears which must
be all to herself.


<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) found, on reaching home, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) intended, escaped
seeing Mr Elliot; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had called and paid them a long morning
visit; but hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) congratulated herself, and felt safe, when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was coming again in the evening.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I had not the smallest intention of asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, with
affected carelessness, "but he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) gave so many hints; so Mrs Clay says, at
least."

<p/>"Indeed, I do say it.  I never saw anybody in my life spell harder for
an invitation.  Poor man!  I was really in pain for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for your
hard-hearted sister, Miss Anne, seems bent on cruelty."

<p/>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I have been rather too much used to the game to
be soon overcome by a gentleman's hints.  However, when I found how
excessively he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was regretting that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) should miss my father this
morning, I gave way immediately, for I would never really omit an
opportunity of bringing him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) and Sir Walter together.  They appear to so
much advantage in company with each other.  Each behaving so
pleasantly.  Mr Elliot looking up with so much respect."

<p/>"Quite delightful!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs Clay, not daring, however, to turn her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>)
eyes towards Anne.  " (<font color='red'><b>father son</b></font>)</div>Exactly like father and son!  Dear Miss Elliot,
may I not say father and son?"

<p/>"Oh! I lay no embargo on any body's words.  If you will have such
ideas!  But, upon my word, I am scarcely sensible of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) attentions
being beyond those of other men."

<p/>"My dear Miss Elliot!<div class="bookquote">" exclaimed Mrs Clay, lifting her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) hands and eyes,
and sinking all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) astonishment in a convenient silence.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Penelope</b></font>)</div>Well, my dear Penelope, you need not be so alarmed about him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>).  I did
invite him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), you know.  I sent him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) away with smiles.  When I found he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
was really going to his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) friends at Thornberry Park for the whole day
to-morrow, I had compassion on him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)."

<p/>Anne admired the good acting of the friend, in being able to shew such
pleasure as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, in the expectation and in the actual arrival of
the very person whose presence must really be interfering with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
prime object.  It was impossible but that Mrs Clay must hate the sight
of Mr Elliot; and yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could assume a most obliging, placid look,
and appear quite satisfied with the curtailed license of devoting
herself only half as much to Sir Walter as she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) would have done
otherwise.

<p/>To Anne herself it was most distressing to see Mr Elliot enter the
room; and quite painful to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) approach and speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
been used before to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not be always quite sincere, but
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw insincerity in everything.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) attentive deference to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father, contrasted with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) former language, was odious; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
thought of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) cruel conduct towards Mrs Smith, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could hardly bear
the sight of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present smiles and mildness, or the sound of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
artificial good sentiments.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) meant to avoid any such alteration of manners as might provoke a
remonstrance on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) side.  It was a great object to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) to escape all
enquiry or eclat; but it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) intention to be as decidedly cool to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) as might be compatible with their relationship; and to retrace, as
quietly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could, the few steps of unnecessary intimacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had
been gradually led along.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) was accordingly more guarded, and more
cool, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had been the night before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted to animate her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) curiosity again as to how and where he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could
have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) formerly praised; wanted very much to be gratified by
more solicitation; but the charm was broken: he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) found that the heat and
animation of a public room was necessary to kindle his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) modest cousin's
vanity; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) found, at least, that it was not to be done now, by any of
those attempts which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could hazard among the too-commanding claims of
the others.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) little surmised that it was a subject acting now
exactly against his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) interest, bringing immediately to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) thoughts all
those parts of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) conduct which were least excusable.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had some satisfaction in finding that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was really going out of
Bath the next morning, going early, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) would be gone the
greater part of two days.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was invited again to Camden Place the
very evening of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) return; but from Thursday to Saturday evening his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
absence was certain.  It was bad enough that a Mrs Clay should be
always before her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>); but that a deeper hypocrite should be added to their
party, seemed the destruction of everything like peace and comfort.  It
was so humiliating to reflect on the constant deception practised on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) father and Elizabeth; to consider the various sources of
mortification preparing for them!  Mrs Clay's selfishness was not so
complicate nor so revolting as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>); and Anne would have compounded for
the marriage at once, with all its evils, to be clear of Mr Elliot's
subtleties in endeavouring to prevent it.

<p/>On Friday morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) meant to go very early to Lady Russell, and
accomplish the necessary communication; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would have gone
directly after breakfast, but that Mrs Clay was also going out on some
obliging purpose of saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) sister trouble, which determined her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) to
wait till she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) might be safe from such a companion.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) saw Mrs Clay
fairly off, therefore, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) began to talk of spending the morning
in Rivers Street.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "I have nothing to send but my love.  Oh!
you may as well take back that tiresome book she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would lend me, and
pretend I have read it through.  I really cannot be plaguing myself for
ever with all the new poems and states of the nation that come out.
Lady Russell quite bores one with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) new publications.  You need not
tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) so, but I thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) dress hideous the other night.  I used
to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had some taste in dress, but I was ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) at the
concert.  Something so formal and _arrangé_ in her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) air!  and she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) sits so
upright!  My best love, of course."

<p/>"And mine,<div class="bookquote">" added Sir Walter.  " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Kindest regards.  And you may say, that
I mean to call upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) soon.  Make a civil message; but I shall only
leave my card.  Morning visits are never fair by women at her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) time of
life, who make themselves up so little.  If she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would only wear rouge
she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would not be afraid of being seen; but last time I called, I
observed the blinds were let down immediately."

<p/>While her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father spoke, there was a knock at the door.  Who could it
be?  Anne, remembering the preconcerted visits, at all hours, of Mr
Elliot, would have expected him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), but for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) known engagement seven
miles off.  After the usual period of suspense, the usual sounds of
approach were heard, and <div class="bookquote">"Mr and Mrs Charles Musgrove"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were ushered
into the room.

<p/>Surprise was the strongest emotion raised by their appearance; but Anne
was really glad to see them; and the others were not so sorry but that
they could put on a decent air of welcome; and as soon as it became
clear that these, their nearest relations, were not arrived with any
views of accommodation in that house, Sir Walter and Elizabeth were
able to rise in cordiality, and do the honours of it very well.  They
were come to Bath for a few days with Mrs Musgrove, and were at the
White Hart.  So much was pretty soon understood; but till Sir Walter
and Elizabeth were walking Mary into the other drawing-room, and
regaling themselves with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) admiration, Anne could not draw upon
Charles's brain for a regular history of their coming, or an
explanation of some smiling hints of particular business, which had
been ostentatiously dropped by Mary, as well as of some apparent
confusion as to whom their party consisted of.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) then found that it consisted of Mrs Musgrove, Henrietta, and
Captain Harville, beside their two selves.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) a very plain,
intelligible account of the whole; a narration in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) saw a great
deal of most characteristic proceeding.  The scheme had received its
first impulse by Captain Harville's wanting to come to Bath on
business.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) had begun to talk of it a week ago; and by way of doing
something, as shooting was over, Charles had proposed coming with him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>),
and Mrs Harville had seemed to like the idea of it very much, as an
advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) husband; but Mary could not bear to be left, and had
made herself so unhappy about it, that for a day or two everything
seemed to be in suspense, or at an end.  But then, it had been taken up
by his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) father and mother.  His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother had some old friends in Bath whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wanted to see; it was thought a good opportunity for Henrietta to
come and buy wedding-clothes for herself and her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) sister; and, in short,
it ended in being his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) mother's party, that everything might be
comfortable and easy to Captain Harville; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and Mary were included
in it by way of general convenience.  They had arrived late the night
before.  Mrs Harville, her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) children, and Captain Benwick, remained with
Mr Musgrove and Louisa at Uppercross.

<p/>Anne's only surprise was, that affairs should be in forwardness enough
for Henrietta's wedding-clothes to be talked of.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had imagined such
difficulties of fortune to exist there as must prevent the marriage
from being near at hand; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) learned from Charles that, very
recently, (since Mary's last letter to herself), Charles Hayter had
been applied to by a friend to hold a living for a youth who could not
possibly claim it under many years; and that on the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>)
present income, with almost a certainty of something more permanent
long before the term in question, the two families had consented to the
young people's wishes, and that their marriage was likely to take place
in a few months, quite as soon as Louisa's.  "And a very good living it
was," Charles added:  <div class="bookquote">"only five-and-twenty miles from Uppercross, and
in a very fine country: fine part of Dorsetshire.  In the centre of
some of the best preserves in the kingdom, surrounded by three great
proprietors, each more careful and jealous than the other; and to two
of the three at least, Charles Hayter might get a special
recommendation.  Not that he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) will value it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) ought,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Hayter</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Hayter</b></font>) observed,
"Charles is too cool about sporting. That's the worst of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am extremely glad, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne</b></font>)</div>cried Anne, "particularly glad that this
should happen; and that of two sisters, who both deserve equally well,
and who have always been such good friends, the pleasant prospect of
one should not be dimming those of the other--that they should be so
equal in their prosperity and comfort.  I hope your father and mother
are quite happy with regard to both."

<p/>"Oh! yes.  My father would be well pleased if the gentlemen were
richer, but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has no other fault to find.  Money, you know, coming
down with money--two daughters at once--it cannot be a very agreeable
operation, and it streightens him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) as to many things.  However, I do not
mean to say they have not a right to it.  It is very fit they should
have daughters' shares; and I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has always been a very kind,
liberal father to me.  Mary does not above half like Henrietta's match.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) never did, you know.  But she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does not do him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) justice, nor think
enough about Winthrop.  I cannot make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) attend to the value of the
property.  It is a very fair match, as times go; and I have liked
Charles Hayter all my life, and I shall not leave off now."

<p/>"Such excellent parents as Mr and Mrs Musgrove," exclaimed Anne,
"should be happy in their children's marriages.  They do everything to
confer happiness, I am sure.  What a blessing to young people to be in
such hands!  Your father and mother seem so totally free from all those
ambitious feelings which have led to so much misconduct and misery,
both in young and old.  I hope you think Louisa perfectly recovered
now?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answered rather hesitatingly, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Yes, I believe I do; very much
recovered; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) is altered; there is no running or jumping about, no
laughing or dancing; it is quite different.  If one happens only to
shut the door a little hard, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) starts and wriggles like a young
dab-chick in the water; and Benwick sits at her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) elbow, reading verses,
or whispering to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>), all day long.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Anne could not help laughing.  " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That cannot be much to your taste, I
know," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); "but I do believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) to be an excellent young man."

<p/>"To be sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) is.  Nobody doubts it; and I hope you do not think I am
so illiberal as to want every man to have the same objects and
pleasures as myself.  I have a great value for Benwick; and when one
can but get him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has plenty to say.  His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reading has done
him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no harm, for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has fought as well as read.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is a brave fellow.
I got more acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) last Monday than ever I did before.  We
had a famous set-to at rat-hunting all the morning in my father's great
barns; and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) played his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) part so well that I have liked him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the better
ever since."

<p/>Here they were interrupted by the absolute necessity of Charles's
following the others to admire mirrors and china; but Anne had heard
enough to understand the present state of Uppercross, and rejoice in
its happiness; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sighed as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) rejoiced, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sigh had none
of the ill-will of envy in it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would certainly have risen to their
blessings if she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not want to lessen theirs.

<p/>The visit passed off altogether in high good humour.  Mary was in
excellent spirits, enjoying the gaiety and the change, and so well
satisfied with the journey in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) mother-in-law's carriage with four
horses, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own complete independence of Camden Place, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was exactly in a temper to admire everything as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ought, and
enter most readily into all the superiorities of the house, as they
were detailed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no demands on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) father or sister, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) consequence was just enough increased by their handsome
drawing-rooms.

<p/>Elizabeth was, for a short time, suffering a good deal.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt that
Mrs Musgrove and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) party ought to be asked to dine with them; but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could not bear to have the difference of style, the reduction of
servants, which a dinner must betray, witnessed by those who had been
always so inferior to the Elliots of Kellynch.  It was a struggle
between propriety and vanity; but vanity got the better, and then
Elizabeth was happy again.  These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) internal persuasions: "Old
fashioned notions; country hospitality; we do not profess to give
dinners; few people in Bath do; Lady Alicia never does; did not even
ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Alicia</b></font>) own sister's family, though they were here a month: and I dare
say it would be very inconvenient to Mrs Musgrove; put her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) quite out of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) way.  I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) would rather not come; she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) cannot feel easy
with us.  I will ask them all for an evening; that will be much better;
that will be a novelty and a treat.  They have not seen two such
drawing rooms before.  They will be delighted to come to-morrow
evening.  It shall be a regular party, small, but most elegant."  And
this satisfied Elizabeth:  and when the invitation was given to the two
present, and promised for the absent, Mary was as completely satisfied.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was particularly asked to meet Mr Elliot, and be introduced to Lady
Dalrymple and Miss Carteret, who were fortunately already engaged to
come; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) could not have received a more gratifying attention.
Miss Elliot was to have the honour of calling on Mrs Musgrove in the
course of the morning; and Anne walked off with Charles and Mary, to go
and see her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) and Henrietta directly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) plan of sitting with Lady Russell must give way for the present.
They all three called in Rivers Street for a couple of minutes; but
Anne convinced herself that a day's delay of the intended communication
could be of no consequence, and hastened forward to the White Hart, to
see again the friends and companions of the last autumn, with an
eagerness of good-will which many associations contributed to form.

<p/>They found Mrs Musgrove and her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) daughter within, and by themselves, and
Anne had the kindest welcome from each.  Henrietta was exactly in that
state of recently-improved views, of fresh-formed happiness, which made
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) full of regard and interest for everybody she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) had ever liked before
at all; and Mrs Musgrove's real affection had been won by her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
usefulness when they were in distress.  It was a heartiness, and a
warmth, and a sincerity which Anne delighted in the more, from the sad
want of such blessings at home.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was entreated to give them as much
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) time as possible, invited for every day and all day long, or
rather claimed as part of the family; and, in return, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) naturally
fell into all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wonted ways of attention and assistance, and on
Charles's leaving them together, was listening to Mrs Musgrove's
history of Louisa, and to Henrietta's of herself, giving opinions on
business, and recommendations to shops; with intervals of every help
which Mary required, from altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) ribbon to settling her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) accounts;
from finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) keys, and assorting her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trinkets, to trying to
convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was not ill-used by anybody; which Mary, well
amused as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) generally was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) station at a window overlooking the
entrance to the Pump Room, could not but have her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) moments of imagining.

<p/>A morning of thorough confusion was to be expected.  A large party in
an hotel ensured a quick-changing, unsettled scene.  One five minutes
brought a note, the next a parcel; and Anne had not been there half an
hour, when their dining-room, spacious as it was, seemed more than half
filled:  a party of steady old friends were seated around Mrs Musgrove,
and Charles came back with Captains Harville and Wentworth.  The
appearance of the latter could not be more than the surprise of the
moment.  It was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) to have forgotten to feel that this
arrival of their common friends must be soon bringing them together
again.  Their last meeting had been most important in opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) had derived from it a delightful conviction; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>)
feared from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) looks, that the same unfortunate persuasion, which had
hastened him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) away from the Concert Room, still governed.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not
seem to want to be near enough for conversation.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Harville</b></font>) tried to be calm, and leave things to take their course, and tried
to dwell much on this argument of rational dependence:--"Surely, if
there be constant attachment on each side, our hearts must understand
each other ere long.  We are not boy and girl, to be captiously
irritable, misled by every moment's inadvertence, and wantonly playing
with our own happiness.<div class="bookquote">"  And yet, a few minutes afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) felt
as if their being in company with each other, under their present
circumstances, could only be exposing them to inadvertencies and
misconstructions of the most mischievous kind.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne</b></font>)</div>Anne,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mary, still at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) window, " (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne</b></font>)</div>there is Mrs Clay, I am sure,
standing under the colonnade, and a gentleman with her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>).  I saw them
turn the corner from Bath Street just now.  They seemed deep in talk.
Who is it?  Come, and tell me.  Good heavens! I recollect.  It is Mr
Elliot himself."

<p/>"No,<div class="bookquote">" cried Anne, quickly, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr Elliot</b></font>)</div>it cannot be Mr Elliot, I assure you.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
was to leave Bath at nine this morning, and does not come back till
to-morrow."

<p/>As she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spoke, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that Captain Wentworth was looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), the
consciousness of which vexed and embarrassed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) regret
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had said so much, simple as it was.

<p/>Mary, resenting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should be supposed not to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own cousin,
began talking very warmly about the family features, and protesting
still more positively that it was Mr Elliot, calling again upon Anne to
come and look for herself, but Anne did not mean to stir, and tried to
be cool and unconcerned.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) distress returned, however, on perceiving
smiles and intelligent glances pass between two or three of the lady
visitors, as if they believed themselves quite in the secret.  It was
evident that the report concerning her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had spread, and a short pause
succeeded, which seemed to ensure that it would now spread farther.

<p/>"Do come, Anne," cried Mary, "come and look yourself.  You will be too
late if you do not make haste.  They are parting; they are shaking
hands.  He (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>) is turning away.  Not know Mr Elliot, indeed!  You seem to
have forgot all about Lyme."

<p/>To pacify Mary, and perhaps screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) own embarrassment, Anne did move
quietly to the window.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was just in time to ascertain that it
really was Mr Elliot, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never believed, before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
disappeared on one side, as Mrs Clay walked quickly off on the other;
and checking the surprise which she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) could not but feel at such an
appearance of friendly conference between two persons of totally
opposite interest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) calmly said, <div class="bookquote">"Yes, it is Mr Elliot, certainly.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) has changed his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) hour of going, I suppose, that is all, or I may be
mistaken, I might not attend;"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and walked back to her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) chair,
recomposed, and with the comfortable hope of having acquitted herself
well.

<p/>The visitors took their leave; and Charles, having civilly seen them
off, and then made a face at them, and abused them for coming, began
with--

<p/>"Well, mother, I have done something for you that you will like.  I
have been to the theatre, and secured a box for to-morrow night.  A'n't
I a good boy?  I know you love a play; and there is room for us all.
It holds nine.  I have engaged Captain Wentworth.  Anne will not be
sorry to join us, I am sure.  We all like a play.  Have not I done
well, mother?"

<p/>Mrs Musgrove was good humouredly beginning to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) perfect
readiness for the play, if Henrietta and all the others liked it, when
Mary eagerly interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) by exclaiming--

<p/>"Good heavens, Charles! how can you think of such a thing?  Take a box
for to-morrow night!  Have you forgot that we are engaged to Camden
Place to-morrow night? and that we were most particularly asked to meet
Lady Dalrymple and her (<font color='blue'><b>Dalrymple</b></font>) daughter, and Mr Elliot, and all the principal
family connexions, on purpose to be introduced to them?  How can you be
so forgetful?"

<p/>"Phoo! phoo!" replied Charles, "what's an evening party?  Never worth
remembering.  Your father might have asked us to dinner, I think, if he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
had wanted to see us.  You may do as you like, but I shall go to the
play."

<p/>"Oh! Charles, I declare it will be too abominable if you do, when you
promised to go."

<p/>"No, I did not promise.  I only smirked and bowed, and said the word
<div class="bookquote">'happy.'   (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>There was no promise."

<p/>"But you must go, Charles.  It would be unpardonable to fail.  We were
asked on purpose to be introduced.  There was always such a great
connexion between the Dalrymples and ourselves.  Nothing ever happened
on either side that was not announced immediately.  We are quite near
relations, you know; and Mr Elliot too, whom you ought so particularly
to be acquainted with!  Every attention is due to Mr Elliot.  Consider,
my father's heir:  the future representative of the family."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Don't talk to me about heirs and representatives,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Hayter</b></font>)</div>cried Charles.  "I
am not one of those who neglect the reigning power to bow to the rising
sun.  If I would not go for the sake of your father, I should think it
scandalous to go for the sake of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) heir.  What is Mr Elliot to me?"
The careless expression was life to Anne, who saw that Captain
Wentworth was all attention, looking and listening with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) whole soul;
and that the last words brought his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) enquiring eyes from Charles to
herself.

<p/>Charles and Mary still talked on in the same style; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), half serious
and half jesting, maintaining the scheme for the play, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>),
invariably serious, most warmly opposing it, and not omitting to make
it known that, however determined to go to Camden Place herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
should not think herself very well used, if they went to the play
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>).  Mrs Musgrove interposed.

<p/>"We had better put it off.  Charles, you had much better go back and
change the box for Tuesday.  It would be a pity to be divided, and we
should be losing Miss Anne, too, if there is a party at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's;
and I am sure neither Henrietta nor I should care at all for the play,
if Miss Anne could not be with us."

<p/>Anne felt truly obliged to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) for such kindness; and quite as much so
for the opportunity it gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of decidedly saying--

<p/>"If it depended only on my inclination, ma'am, the party at home
(excepting on Mary's account) would not be the smallest impediment.  I
have no pleasure in the sort of meeting, and should be too happy to
change it for a play, and with you.  But, it had better not be
attempted, perhaps."  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had spoken it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) trembled when it was
done, conscious that her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) words were listened to, and daring not even to
try to observe their effect.

<p/>It was soon generally agreed that Tuesday should be the day; Charles
only reserving the advantage of still teasing his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wife, by persisting
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would go to the play to-morrow if nobody else would.

<p/>Captain Wentworth left his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) seat, and walked to the fire-place; probably
for the sake of walking away from it soon afterwards, and taking a
station, with less bare-faced design, by Anne.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have not been long enough in Bath,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), "to enjoy the evening
parties of the place."

<p/>"Oh! no.  The usual character of them has nothing for me.  I am no
card-player."

<p/>"You were not formerly, I know.  You did not use to like cards; but
time makes many changes."

<p/>"I am not yet so much changed," cried Anne, and stopped, fearing she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
hardly knew what misconstruction.  After waiting a few moments he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) said,
and as if it were the result of immediate feeling, "It is a period,
indeed!  Eight years and a half is a period."

<p/>Whether he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>) would have proceeded farther was left to Anne's imagination
to ponder over in a calmer hour; for while still hearing the sounds he (<font color='blue'><b>player</b></font>)
had uttered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was startled to other subjects by Henrietta, eager to
make use of the present leisure for getting out, and calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>)
companions to lose no time, lest somebody else should come in.

<p/>They were obliged to move.  Anne talked of being perfectly ready, and
tried to look it; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt that could Henrietta have known the
regret and reluctance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) heart in quitting that chair, in preparing
to quit the room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) would have found, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) own sensations for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>) cousin, in the very security of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) affection, wherewith to pity
her (<font color='blue'><b>Henrietta</b></font>).

<p/>Their preparations, however, were stopped short.  Alarming sounds were
heard; other visitors approached, and the door was thrown open for Sir
Walter and Miss Elliot, whose entrance seemed to give a general chill.
Anne felt an instant oppression, and wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) looked saw symptoms
of the same.  The comfort, the freedom, the gaiety of the room was
over, hushed into cold composure, determined silence, or insipid talk,
to meet the heartless elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister.  How
mortifying to feel that it was so!

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) jealous eye was satisfied in one particular.  Captain Wentworth was
acknowledged again by each, by Elizabeth more graciously than before.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) even addressed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) once, and looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) more than once.
Elizabeth was, in fact, revolving a great measure.  The sequel
explained it.  After the waste of a few minutes in saying the proper
nothings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to give the invitation which was to comprise all
the remaining dues of the Musgroves.  <div class="bookquote">"To-morrow evening, to meet a few
friends:  no formal party."  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was all said very gracefully, and the
cards with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had provided herself, the <div class="bookquote">"Miss Elliot at home,"
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were laid on the table, with a courteous, comprehensive smile to all,
and one smile and one card more decidedly for Captain Wentworth.  The
truth was, that Elizabeth had been long enough in Bath to understand
the importance of a man of such an air and appearance as his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).  The past
was nothing.  The present was that Captain Wentworth would move about
well in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drawing-room.  The card was pointedly given, and Sir Walter
and Elizabeth arose and disappeared.

<p/>The interruption had been short, though severe, and ease and animation
returned to most of those they left as the door shut them out, but not
to Anne.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could think only of the invitation she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had with such
astonishment witnessed, and of the manner in which it had been
received; a manner of doubtful meaning, of surprise rather than
gratification, of polite acknowledgement rather than acceptance.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) saw disdain in his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) eye, and could not venture to believe
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had determined to accept such an offering, as an atonement for
all the insolence of the past.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits sank.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) held the card in
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hand after they were gone, as if deeply considering it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Only think of Elizabeth's including everybody!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>whispered Mary very
audibly.  "I do not wonder Captain Wentworth is delighted!  You see he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
cannot put the card out of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) hand."

<p/>Anne caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) eye, saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) cheeks glow, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) mouth form itself
into a momentary expression of contempt, and turned away, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
might neither see nor hear more to vex her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).

<p/>The party separated.  The gentlemen had their own pursuits, the ladies
proceeded on their own business, and they met no more while Anne
belonged to them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was earnestly begged to return and dine, and
give them all the rest of the day, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) spirits had been so long
exerted that at present she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) felt unequal to more, and fit only for
home, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might be sure of being as silent as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) chose.

<p/>Promising to be with them the whole of the following morning,
therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) closed the fatigues of the present by a toilsome walk to
Camden Place, there to spend the evening chiefly in listening to the
busy arrangements of Elizabeth and Mrs Clay for the morrow's party, the
frequent enumeration of the persons invited, and the continually
improving detail of all the embellishments which were to make it the
most completely elegant of its kind in Bath, while harassing herself
with the never-ending question, of whether Captain Wentworth would come
or not?  They were reckoning him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) as certain, but with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) it was a
gnawing solicitude never appeased for five minutes together.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
generally thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would come, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) generally thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ought; but it was a case which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not so shape into any positive
act of duty or discretion, as inevitably to defy the suggestions of
very opposite feelings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only roused herself from the broodings of this restless agitation,
to let Mrs Clay know that she (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) had been seen with Mr Elliot three hours
after his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being supposed to be out of Bath, for having watched in vain
for some intimation of the interview from the lady herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
determined to mention it, and it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) there was guilt in Mrs
Clay's face as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) listened.  It was transient: cleared away in an
instant; but Anne could imagine she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) read there the consciousness of
having, by some complication of mutual trick, or some overbearing
authority of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), been obliged to attend (perhaps for half an hour) to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) lectures and restrictions on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) designs on Sir Walter.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
exclaimed, however, with a very tolerable imitation of nature:--

<p/>"Oh! dear! very true.  Only think, Miss Elliot, to my great surprise I
met with Mr Elliot in Bath Street.  I was never more astonished.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
turned back and walked with me to the Pump Yard.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been prevented
setting off for Thornberry, but I really forget by what; for I was in a
hurry, and could not much attend, and I can only answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being
determined not to be delayed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) return.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wanted to know how
early he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might be admitted to-morrow.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was full of <div class="bookquote">'to-morrow,'  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>and
it is very evident that I have been full of it too, ever since I
entered the house, and learnt the extension of your plan and all that
had happened, or my seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could never have gone so entirely out of
my head."
