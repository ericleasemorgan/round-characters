<p/>After a week spent in professions of love and schemes of
felicity, Mr. Collins was called from his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) amiable Charlotte by
the arrival of Saturday. The pain of separation, however, might
be alleviated on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) side, by preparations for the reception of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) bride; as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had reason to hope, that shortly after his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
return into Hertfordshire, the day would be fixed that was to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the happiest of men. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) took leave of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relations at
Longbourn with as much solemnity as before; wished his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) fair
cousins health and happiness again, and promised their father
another letter of thanks.

<p/>On the following Monday, Mrs. Bennet had the pleasure of
receiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, who came as usual to spend
the Christmas at Longbourn. Mr. Gardiner was a sensible,
gentlemanlike man, greatly superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) sister, as well by
nature as education. The Netherfield ladies would have had
difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade, and within
view of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own warehouses, could have been so well-bred and
agreeable. Mrs. Gardiner, who was several years younger than Mrs.
Bennet and Mrs. Phillips, was an amiable, intelligent, elegant
woman, and a great favourite with all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) Longbourn nieces.
Between the two eldest and herself especially, there subsisted a
particular regard. They had frequently been staying with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) in
town.

<p/>The first part of Mrs. Gardiner’s business on her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) arrival was to
distribute her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) presents and describe the newest fashions. When
this was done she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had a less active part to play. It became her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
turn to listen. Mrs. Bennet had many grievances to relate, and
much to complain of. They had all been very ill-used since she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
last saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister. Two of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) girls had been upon the point of
marriage, and after all there was nothing in it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not blame Jane,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) continued, "for Jane would have got
Mr. Bingley if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could. But Lizzy! Oh, sister! It is very hard
to think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might have been Mr. Collins’s wife by this
time, had it not been for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own perverseness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) an
offer in this very room, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) refused him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). The consequence of
it is, that Lady Lucas will have a daughter married before I
have, and that the Longbourn estate is just as much entailed as
ever. The Lucases are very artful people indeed, sister. They are
all for what they can get. I am sorry to say it of them, but so
it is. It makes me very nervous and poorly, to be thwarted so in
my own family, and to have neighbours who think of themselves
before anybody else. However, your coming just at this time is
the greatest of comforts, and I am very glad to hear what you
tell us, of long sleeves."

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given
before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth’s correspondence with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
nieces, turned the conversation.

<p/>When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke more on the
subject. <div class="bookquote">"It seems likely to have been a desirable match for
Jane,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). "I am sorry it went off. But these things happen
so often! A young man, such as you describe Mr. Bingley, so
easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks, and when
accident separates them, so easily forgets her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), that these sort
of inconsistencies are very frequent."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"An excellent consolation in its way,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "but it
will not do for _us_. We do not suffer by accident. It does not
often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a
young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was violently in love with only a few days before."

<p/>"But that expression of <div class="bookquote">‘violently in love’  (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>is so hackneyed, so
doubtful, so indefinite, that it gives me very little idea. It is
as often applied to feelings which arise from a half-hour’s
acquaintance, as to a real, strong attachment. Pray, how _violent
was_ Mr. Bingley’s love?"

<p/>"I never saw a more promising inclination; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was growing quite
inattentive to other people, and wholly engrossed by her (<font color='blue'><b>It</b></font>). Every
time they met, it was more decided and remarkable. At his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own
ball he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) offended two or three young ladies, by not asking them to
dance; and I spoke to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) twice myself, without receiving an
answer. Could there be finer symptoms? Is not general incivility
the very essence of love?"

<p/>"Oh, yes!—of that kind of love which I suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to have felt.
Poor Jane! I am sorry for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), because, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) disposition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
may not get over it immediately. It had better have happened to
_you_, Lizzy; you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner.
But do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) would be prevailed upon to go back with us?
Change of scene might be of service—and perhaps a little relief
from home may be as useful as anything.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt
persuaded of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s ready acquiescence.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hope," added Mrs. Gardiner, "that no consideration with regard
to this young man will influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>). We live in so different a
part of town, all our connections are so different, and, as you
well know, we go out so little, that it is very improbable that
they should meet at all, unless he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) really comes to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)."

<p/>"And _that_ is quite impossible; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is now in the custody of
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) friend, and Mr. Darcy would no more suffer him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to call on
Jane in such a part of London! My dear aunt, how could you think
of it? Mr. Darcy may perhaps have _heard_ of such a place as
Gracechurch Street, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would hardly think a month’s ablution
enough to cleanse him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from its impurities, were he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) once to enter
it; and depend upon it, Mr. Bingley never stirs without him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)."

<p/>"So much the better. I hope they will not meet at all. But does
not Jane correspond with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister? _She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ will not be able to
help calling."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) will drop the acquaintance entirely."

<p/>But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to
place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of
Bingley’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) felt a solicitude
on the subject which convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), on examination, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did
not consider it entirely hopeless. It was possible, and sometimes
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) thought it probable, that his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) affection might be reanimated,
and the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) friends successfully combated by the
more natural influence of Jane’s attractions.

<p/>Miss Bennet accepted her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) aunt’s invitation with pleasure; and the
Bingleys were no otherwise in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) thoughts at the same time, than
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hoped by Caroline’s not living in the same house with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
brother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might occasionally spend a morning with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), without
any danger of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/>The Gardiners stayed a week at Longbourn; and what with the
Phillipses, the Lucases, and the officers, there was not a day
without its engagement. Mrs. Bennet had so carefully provided for
the entertainment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother and sister, that they did not
once sit down to a family dinner. When the engagement was for
home, some of the officers always made part of it—of which
officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions,
Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth’s warm
commendation, narrowly observed them both. Without supposing
them, from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) saw, to be very seriously in love, their
preference of each other was plain enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) a little
uneasy; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject
before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) left Hertfordshire, and represent to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the
imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.

<p/>To Mrs. Gardiner, Wickham had one means of affording pleasure,
unconnected with his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) general powers. About ten or a dozen years
ago, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had spent a considerable time in
that very part of Derbyshire to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) belonged. They had,
therefore, many acquaintances in common; and though Wickham had
been little there since the death of Darcy’s father, it was yet
in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) power to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) fresher intelligence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) former
friends than she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had been in the way of procuring.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner had seen Pemberley, and known the late Mr. Darcy by
character perfectly well. Here consequently was an inexhaustible
subject of discourse. In comparing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollection of Pemberley
with the minute description which Wickham could give, and in
bestowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) tribute of praise on the character of its late
possessor, she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was delighting both him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) and herself. On being made
acquainted with the present Mr. Darcy’s treatment of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
tried to remember some of that gentleman’s reputed disposition
when quite a lad which might agree with it, and was confident at
last that she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) recollected having heard Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy
formerly spoken of as a very proud, ill-natured boy.
