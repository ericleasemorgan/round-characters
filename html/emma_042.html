<p/>After being long fed with hopes of a speedy visit from Mr. and Mrs. Suckling, the Highbury world were obliged to endure the mortification of hearing that they could not possibly come till the autumn. No such importation of novelties could enrich their intellectual stores at present. In the daily interchange of news, they must be again restricted to the other topics with which for a while the Sucklings' coming had been united, such as the last accounts of Mrs. Churchill, whose health seemed every day to supply a different report, and the situation of Mrs. Weston, whose happiness it was to be hoped might eventually be as much increased by the arrival of a child, as that of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours was by the approach of it.

<p/>Mrs. Elton was very much disappointed. It was the delay of a great deal of pleasure and parade. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) introductions and recommendations must all wait, and every projected party be still only talked of. So she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) thought at first; but a little consideration convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that every thing need not be put off. Why should not they explore to Box Hill though the Sucklings did not come? They could go there again with them in the autumn. It was settled that they should go to Box Hill. That there was to be such a party had been long generally known: it had even given the idea of another. Emma had never been to Box Hill; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to see what every body found so well worth seeing, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and Mr. Weston had agreed to chuse some fine morning and drive thither. Two or three more of the chosen only were to be admitted to join them, and it was to be done in a quiet, unpretending, elegant way, infinitely superior to the bustle and preparation, the regular eating and drinking, and picnic parade of the Eltons and the Sucklings.

<p/>This was so very well understood between them, that Emma could not but feel some surprise, and a little displeasure, on hearing from Mr. Weston that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had been proposing to Mrs. Elton, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) brother and sister had failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), that the two parties should unite, and go together; and that as Mrs. Elton had very readily acceded to it, so it was to be, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had no objection. Now, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) objection was nothing but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) very great dislike of Mrs. Elton, of which Mr. Weston must already be perfectly aware, it was not worth bringing forward again: it could not be done without a reproof to him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), which would be giving pain to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife; and she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) found herself therefore obliged to consent to an arrangement which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would have done a great deal to avoid; an arrangement which would probably expose her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) even to the degradation of being said to be of Mrs. Elton's party! Every feeling was offended; and the forbearance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) outward submission left a heavy arrear due of secret severity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) reflections on the unmanageable goodwill of Mr. Weston's temper.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am glad you approve of what I have done,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) very comfortably. "But I thought you would. Such schemes as these are nothing without numbers. One cannot have too large a party. A large party secures its own amusement. And she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is a good-natured woman after all. One could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) out."

<p/>Emma denied none of it aloud, and agreed to none of it in private.

<p/>It was now the middle of June, and the weather fine; and Mrs. Elton was growing impatient to name the day, and settle with Mr. Weston as to pigeon-pies and cold lamb, when a lame carriage-horse threw every thing into sad uncertainty. It might be weeks, it might be only a few days, before the horse were useable; but no preparations could be ventured on, and it was all melancholy stagnation. Mrs. Elton's resources were inadequate to such an attack.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is not this most vexatious, Knightley?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) cried. "And such weather for exploring! These delays and disappointments are quite odious. What are we to do? The year will wear away at this rate, and nothing done. Before this time last year I assure you we had had a delightful exploring party from Maple Grove to Kings Weston."

<p/>"You had better explore to Donwell,<div class="bookquote">" replied Mr. Knightley. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>That may be done without horses. Come, and eat my strawberries. They are ripening fast."

<p/>If Mr. Knightley did not begin seriously, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was obliged to proceed so, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) proposal was caught at with delight; and the <div class="bookquote">"Oh! I should like it of all things,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>was not plainer in words than manner. Donwell was famous for its strawberry-beds, which seemed a plea for the invitation: but no plea was necessary; cabbage-beds would have been enough to tempt the lady, who only wanted to be going somewhere. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) promised him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) again and again to come much oftener than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) doubted and was extremely gratified by such a proof of intimacy, such a distinguishing compliment as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) chose to consider it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You may depend upon me,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>). "I certainly will come. Name your day, and I will come. You will allow me to bring Jane Fairfax?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I cannot name a day,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), "till I have spoken to some others whom I would wish to meet you."

<p/>"Oh! leave all that to me. Only give me a carte-blanche. I am Lady Patroness, you know. It is my party. I will bring friends with me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope you will bring Elton,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>): "but I will not trouble you to give any other invitations."

<p/>"Oh! now you are looking very sly. But consider you need not be afraid of delegating power to me. I am no young lady on her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) preferment. Married women, you know, may be safely authorised. It is my party. Leave it all to me. I will invite your guests."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) calmly replied, "there is but one married woman in the world whom I can ever allow to invite what guests she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) pleases to Donwell, and that one is "

<p/><div class="bookquote">" Mrs. Weston, I suppose,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>interrupted Mrs. Elton, rather mortified.

<p/>"No Mrs. Knightley; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is in being, I will manage such matters myself."

<p/>"Ah! you are an odd creature!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) cried, satisfied to have no one preferred to herself. " (<font color='red'><b>a humourist</b></font>)</div>You are a humourist, and may say what you like. Quite a humourist. Well, I shall bring Jane with me Jane and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt. The rest I leave to you. I have no objections at all to meeting the Hartfield family. Don't scruple. I know you are attached to them."

<p/>"You certainly will meet them if I can prevail; and I shall call on Miss Bates in my way home."

<p/>"That's quite unnecessary; I see Jane every day: but as you like. It is to be a morning scheme, you know, Knightley; quite a simple thing. I shall wear a large bonnet, and bring one of my little baskets hanging on my arm. Here, probably this basket with pink ribbon. Nothing can be more simple, you see. And Jane will have such another. There is to be no form or parade a sort of gipsy party. We are to walk about your gardens, and gather the strawberries ourselves, and sit under trees; and whatever else you may like to provide, it is to be all out of doors a table spread in the shade, you know. Every thing as natural and simple as possible. Is not that your idea?"

<p/>"Not quite. My idea of the simple and the natural will be to have the table spread in the dining-room. The nature and the simplicity of gentlemen and ladies, with their servants and furniture, I think is best observed by meals within doors. When you are tired of eating strawberries in the garden, there shall be cold meat in the house."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well as you please; only don't have a great set out. And, by the bye, can I or my housekeeper be of any use to you with our opinion? Pray be sincere, Knightley. If you wish me to talk to Mrs. Hodges, or to inspect anything "

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I have not the least wish for it, I thank you."

<p/>"Well but if any difficulties should arise, my housekeeper is extremely clever."

<p/>"I will answer for it, that mine thinks herself full as clever, and would spurn any body's assistance."

<p/>"I wish we had a donkey. The thing would be for us all to come on donkeys, Jane, Miss Bates, and me and my caro sposo walking by. I really must talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) about purchasing a donkey. In a country life I conceive it to be a sort of necessary; for, let a woman have ever so many resources, it is not possible for her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to be always shut up at home; and very long walks, you know in summer there is dust, and in winter there is dirt."

<p/>"You will not find either, between Donwell and Highbury. Donwell Lane is never dusty, and now it is perfectly dry. Come on a donkey, however, if you prefer it. You can borrow Mrs. Cole's. I would wish every thing to be as much to your taste as possible."

<p/>"That I am sure you would. Indeed I do you justice, my good friend. Under that peculiar sort of dry, blunt manner, I know you have the warmest heart. As I tell Mr. E., you are a thorough humourist. Yes, believe me, Knightley, I am fully sensible of your attention to me in the whole of this scheme. You have hit upon the very thing to please me."

<p/>Mr. Knightley had another reason for avoiding a table in the shade. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wished to persuade Mr. Woodhouse, as well as Emma, to join the party; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) knew that to have any of them sitting down out of doors to eat would inevitably make him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) ill. Mr. Woodhouse must not, under the specious pretence of a morning drive, and an hour or two spent at Donwell, be tempted away to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) misery.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was invited on good faith. No lurking horrors were to upbraid him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) easy credulity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had not been at Donwell for two years. "Some very fine morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma, and Harriet, could go very well; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could sit still with Mrs. Weston, while the dear girls walked about the gardens. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not suppose they could be damp now, in the middle of the day. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should like to see the old house again exceedingly, and should be very happy to meet Mr. and Mrs. Elton, and any other of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not see any objection at all to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma's, and Harriet's going there some very fine morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought it very well done of Mr. Knightley to invite them very kind and sensible much cleverer than dining out. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not fond of dining out."

<p/>Mr. Knightley was fortunate in every body's most ready concurrence. The invitation was everywhere so well received, that it seemed as if, like Mrs. Elton, they were all taking the scheme as a particular compliment to themselves. Emma and Harriet professed very high expectations of pleasure from it; and Mr. Weston, unasked, promised to get Frank over to join them, if possible; a proof of approbation and gratitude which could have been dispensed with. Mr. Knightley was then obliged to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); and Mr. Weston engaged to lose no time in writing, and spare no arguments to induce him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to come.

<p/>In the meanwhile the lame horse recovered so fast, that the party to Box Hill was again under happy consideration; and at last Donwell was settled for one day, and Box Hill for the next, the weather appearing exactly right.

<p/>Under a bright mid-day sun, at almost Midsummer, Mr. Woodhouse was safely conveyed in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) carriage, with one window down, to partake of this al-fresco party; and in one of the most comfortable rooms in the Abbey, especially prepared for him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) by a fire all the morning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was happily placed, quite at his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) ease, ready to talk with pleasure of what had been achieved, and advise every body to come and sit down, and not to heat themselves. Mrs. Weston, who seemed to have walked there on purpose to be tired, and sit all the time with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), remained, when all the others were invited or persuaded out, his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) patient listener and sympathiser.

<p/>It was so long since Emma had been at the Abbey, that as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was satisfied of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was glad to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), and look around her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); eager to refresh and correct her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) memory with more particular observation, more exact understanding of a house and grounds which must ever be so interesting to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) family.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt all the honest pride and complacency which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) alliance with the present and future proprietor could fairly warrant, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) viewed the respectable size and style of the building, its suitable, becoming, characteristic situation, low and sheltered its ample gardens stretching down to meadows washed by a stream, of which the Abbey, with all the old neglect of prospect, had scarcely a sight and its abundance of timber in rows and avenues, which neither fashion nor extravagance had rooted up. The house was larger than Hartfield, and totally unlike it, covering a good deal of ground, rambling and irregular, with many comfortable, and one or two handsome rooms. It was just what it ought to be, and it looked what it was and Emma felt an increasing respect for it, as the residence of a family of such true gentility, untainted in blood and understanding. Some faults of temper John Knightley had; but Isabella had connected herself unexceptionably. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had given them neither men, nor names, nor places, that could raise a blush. These were pleasant feelings, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) walked about and indulged them till it was necessary to do as the others did, and collect round the strawberry-beds. The whole party were assembled, excepting Frank Churchill, who was expected every moment from Richmond; and Mrs. Elton, in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) apparatus of happiness, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) large bonnet and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) basket, was very ready to lead the way in gathering, accepting, or talking strawberries, and only strawberries, could now be thought or spoken of. "The best fruit in England every body's favourite always wholesome. These the finest beds and finest sorts. Delightful to gather for one's self the only way of really enjoying them. Morning decidedly the best time never tired every sort good hautboy infinitely superior no comparison the others hardly eatable hautboys very scarce Chili preferred white wood finest flavour of all price of strawberries in London abundance about Bristol Maple Grove cultivation beds when to be renewed gardeners thinking exactly different no general rule gardeners never to be put out of their way delicious fruit only too rich to be eaten much of inferior to cherries currants more refreshing only objection to gathering strawberries the stooping glaring sun tired to death could bear it no longer must go and sit in the shade."

<p/>Such, for half an hour, was the conversation interrupted only once by Mrs. Weston, who came out, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) solicitude after her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law, to inquire if he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) were come and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was a little uneasy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had some fears of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) horse.

<p/>Seats tolerably in the shade were found; and now Emma was obliged to overhear what Mrs. Elton and Jane Fairfax were talking of. A situation, a most desirable situation, was in question. Mrs. Elton had received notice of it that morning, and was in raptures. It was not with Mrs. Suckling, it was not with Mrs. Bragge, but in felicity and splendour it fell short only of them: it was with a cousin of Mrs. Bragge, an acquaintance of Mrs. Suckling, a lady known at Maple Grove. Delightful, charming, superior, first circles, spheres, lines, ranks, every thing and Mrs. Elton was wild to have the offer closed with immediately. On her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) side, all was warmth, energy, and triumph and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) positively refused to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) friend's negative, though Miss Fairfax continued to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would not at present engage in any thing, repeating the same motives which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been heard to urge before. Still Mrs. Elton insisted on being authorised to write an acquiescence by the morrow's post. How Jane could bear it at all, was astonishing to Emma. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did look vexed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did speak pointedly and at last, with a decision of action unusual to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), proposed a removal. "Should not they walk? Would not Mr. Knightley shew them the gardens all the gardens? She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished to see the whole extent." The pertinacity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend seemed more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could bear.

<p/>It was hot; and after walking some time over the gardens in a scattered, dispersed way, scarcely any three together, they insensibly followed one another to the delicious shade of a broad short avenue of limes, which stretching beyond the garden at an equal distance from the river, seemed the finish of the pleasure grounds. It led to nothing; nothing but a view at the end over a low stone wall with high pillars, which seemed intended, in their erection, to give the appearance of an approach to the house, which never had been there. Disputable, however, as might be the taste of such a termination, it was in itself a charming walk, and the view which closed it extremely pretty. The considerable slope, at nearly the foot of which the Abbey stood, gradually acquired a steeper form beyond its grounds; and at half a mile distant was a bank of considerable abruptness and grandeur, well clothed with wood; and at the bottom of this bank, favourably placed and sheltered, rose the Abbey Mill Farm, with meadows in front, and the river making a close and handsome curve around it.

<p/>It was a sweet view sweet to the eye and the mind. English verdure, English culture, English comfort, seen under a sun bright, without being oppressive.

<p/>In this walk Emma and Mr. Weston found all the others assembled; and towards this view she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) immediately perceived Mr. Knightley and Harriet distinct from the rest, quietly leading the way. Mr. Knightley and Harriet! It was an odd t te- -t te; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was glad to see it. There had been a time when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have scorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) as a companion, and turned from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with little ceremony. Now they seemed in pleasant conversation. There had been a time also when Emma would have been sorry to see Harriet in a spot so favourable for the Abbey Mill Farm; but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feared it not. It might be safely viewed with all its appendages of prosperity and beauty, its rich pastures, spreading flocks, orchard in blossom, and light column of smoke ascending. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) joined them at the wall, and found them more engaged in talking than in looking around. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was giving Harriet information as to modes of agriculture, etc. and Emma received a smile which seemed to say, "These are my own concerns. I have a right to talk on such subjects, without being suspected of introducing Robert Martin." She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>). It was too old a story. Robert Martin had probably ceased to think of Harriet. They took a few turns together along the walk. The shade was most refreshing, and Emma found it the pleasantest part of the day.

<p/>The next remove was to the house; they must all go in and eat; and they were all seated and busy, and still Frank Churchill did not come. Mrs. Weston looked, and looked in vain. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father would not own himself uneasy, and laughed at her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fears; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could not be cured of wishing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would part with his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) black mare. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had expressed himself as to coming, with more than common certainty. <div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) aunt was so much better, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not a doubt of getting over to them."  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Churchill</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Churchill's state, however, as many were ready to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), was liable to such sudden variation as might disappoint her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew in the most reasonable dependence and Mrs. Weston was at last persuaded to believe, or to say, that it must be by some attack of Mrs. Churchill that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) was prevented coming. Emma looked at Harriet while the point was under consideration; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) behaved very well, and betrayed no emotion.

<p/>The cold repast was over, and the party were to go out once more to see what had not yet been seen, the old Abbey fish-ponds; perhaps get as far as the clover, which was to be begun cutting on the morrow, or, at any rate, have the pleasure of being hot, and growing cool again. Mr. Woodhouse, who had already taken his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) little round in the highest part of the gardens, where no damps from the river were imagined even by him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), stirred no more; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter resolved to remain with him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), that Mrs. Weston might be persuaded away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband to the exercise and variety which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) spirits seemed to need.

<p/>Mr. Knightley had done all in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) power for Mr. Woodhouse's entertainment. Books of engravings, drawers of medals, cameos, corals, shells, and every other family collection within his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) cabinets, had been prepared for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) old friend, to while away the morning; and the kindness had perfectly answered. Mr. Woodhouse had been exceedingly well amused. Mrs. Weston had been shewing them all to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and now he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would shew them all to Emma; fortunate in having no other resemblance to a child, than in a total want of taste for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) saw, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was slow, constant, and methodical. Before this second looking over was begun, however, Emma walked into the hall for the sake of a few moments' free observation of the entrance and ground-plot of the house and was hardly there, when Jane Fairfax appeared, coming quickly in from the garden, and with a look of escape. Little expecting to meet Miss Woodhouse so soon, there was a start at first; but Miss Woodhouse was the very person she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was in quest of.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Will you be so kind,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), "when I am missed, as to say that I am gone home? I am going this moment. My aunt is not aware how late it is, nor how long we have been absent but I am sure we shall be wanted, and I am determined to go directly. I have said nothing about it to any body. It would only be giving trouble and distress. Some are gone to the ponds, and some to the lime walk. Till they all come in I shall not be missed; and when they do, will you have the goodness to say that I am gone?"

<p/>"Certainly, if you wish it; but you are not going to walk to Highbury alone?"

<p/>"Yes what should hurt me? I walk fast. I shall be at home in twenty minutes."

<p/>"But it is too far, indeed it is, to be walking quite alone. Let my father's servant go with you. Let me order the carriage. It can be round in five minutes."

<p/>"Thank you, thank you but on no account. I would rather walk. And for me to be afraid of walking alone! I, who may so soon have to guard others!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke with great agitation; and Emma very feelingly replied, "That can be no reason for your being exposed to danger now. I must order the carriage. The heat even would be danger. You are fatigued already."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) answered "I am fatigued; but it is not the sort of fatigue quick walking will refresh me. Miss Woodhouse, we all know at times what it is to be wearied in spirits. Mine, I confess, are exhausted. The greatest kindness you can shew me, will be to let me have my own way, and only say that I am gone when it is necessary.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma had not another word to oppose. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw it all; and entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings, promoted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) quitting the house immediately, and watched her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) safely off with the zeal of a friend. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) parting look was grateful and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) parting words, " (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>Oh! Miss Woodhouse, the comfort of being sometimes alone!<div class="bookquote">" seemed to burst from an overcharged heart, and to describe somewhat of the continual endurance to be practised by her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), even towards some of those who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) best.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such a home, indeed! such an aunt!" said Emma, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) turned back into the hall again. "I do pity you. And the more sensibility you betray of their just horrors, the more I shall like you."

<p/>Jane had not been gone a quarter of an hour, and they had only accomplished some views of St. Mark's Place, Venice, when Frank Churchill entered the room. Emma had not been thinking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had forgotten to think of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Mrs. Weston would be at ease. The black mare was blameless; they were right who had named Mrs. Churchill as the cause. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been detained by a temporary increase of illness in her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); a nervous seizure, which had lasted some hours and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had quite given up every thought of coming, till very late; and had he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) known how hot a ride he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should have, and how late, with all his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hurry, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) must be, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should not have come at all. The heat was excessive; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never suffered any thing like it almost wished he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had staid at home nothing killed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) like heat he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could bear any degree of cold, etc., but heat was intolerable and he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat down, at the greatest possible distance from the slight remains of Mr. Woodhouse's fire, looking very deplorable.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You will soon be cooler, if you sit still,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma.

<p/>"As soon as I am cooler I shall go back again. I could very ill be spared but such a point had been made of my coming! You will all be going soon I suppose; the whole party breaking up. I met one as I came Madness in such weather! absolute madness!"

<p/>Emma listened, and looked, and soon perceived that Frank Churchill's state might be best defined by the expressive phrase of being out of humour. Some people were always cross when they were hot. Such might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) constitution; and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew that eating and drinking were often the cure of such incidental complaints, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) recommended his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) taking some refreshment; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would find abundance of every thing in the dining-room and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) humanely pointed out the door.

<p/>"No he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should not eat. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was not hungry; it would only make him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) hotter." In two minutes, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) relented in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own favour; and muttering something about spruce-beer, walked off. Emma returned all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, saying in secret

<p/>"I am glad I have done being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). I should not like a man who is so soon discomposed by a hot morning. Harriet's sweet easy temper will not mind it."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was gone long enough to have had a very comfortable meal, and came back all the better grown quite cool and, with good manners, like himself able to draw a chair close to them, take an interest in their employment; and regret, in a reasonable way, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) should be so late. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best spirits, but seemed trying to improve them; and, at last, made himself talk nonsense very agreeably. They were looking over views in Swisserland.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"As soon as my aunt gets well, I shall go abroad,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). "I shall never be easy till I have seen some of these places. You will have my sketches, some time or other, to look at or my tour to read or my poem. I shall do something to expose myself."

<p/>"That may be but not by sketches in Swisserland. You will never go to Swisserland. Your uncle and aunt will never allow you to leave England."

<p/>"They may be induced to go too. A warm climate may be prescribed for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>). I have more than half an expectation of our all going abroad. I assure you I have. I feel a strong persuasion, this morning, that I shall soon be abroad. I ought to travel. I am tired of doing nothing. I want a change. I am serious, Miss Woodhouse, whatever your penetrating eyes may fancy I am sick of England and would leave it to-morrow, if I could."

<p/>"You are sick of prosperity and indulgence. Cannot you invent a few hardships for yourself, and be contented to stay?"

<p/>"I sick of prosperity and indulgence! You are quite mistaken. I do not look upon myself as either prosperous or indulged. I am thwarted in every thing material. I do not consider myself at all a fortunate person."

<p/>"You are not quite so miserable, though, as when you first came. Go and eat and drink a little more, and you will do very well. Another slice of cold meat, another draught of Madeira and water, will make you nearly on a par with the rest of us."

<p/>"No I shall not stir. I shall sit by you. You are my best cure."

<p/>"We are going to Box Hill to-morrow; you will join us. It is not Swisserland, but it will be something for a young man so much in want of a change. You will stay, and go with us?"

<p/>"No, certainly not; I shall go home in the cool of the evening."

<p/>"But you may come again in the cool of to-morrow morning."

<p/>"No It will not be worth while. If I come, I shall be cross."

<p/>"Then pray stay at Richmond."

<p/>"But if I do, I shall be crosser still. I can never bear to think of you all there without me."

<p/>"These are difficulties which you must settle for yourself. Chuse your own degree of crossness. I shall press you no more."

<p/>The rest of the party were now returning, and all were soon collected. With some there was great joy at the sight of Frank Churchill; others took it very composedly; but there was a very general distress and disturbance on Miss Fairfax's disappearance being explained. That it was time for every body to go, concluded the subject; and with a short final arrangement for the next day's scheme, they parted. Frank Churchill's little inclination to exclude himself increased so much, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) last words to Emma were,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well; if you wish me to stay and join the party, I will."

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) smiled her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) acceptance; and nothing less than a summons from Richmond was to take him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) back before the following evening.
