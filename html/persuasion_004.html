<p/>He was not Mr Wentworth, the former curate of Monkford, however
suspicious appearances may be, but a Captain Frederick Wentworth, his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
brother, who being made commander in consequence of the action off St
Domingo, and not immediately employed, had come into Somersetshire, in
the summer of 1806; and having no parent living, found a home for half
a year at Monkford.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) was, at that time, a remarkably fine young man,
with a great deal of intelligence, spirit, and brilliancy; and Anne an
extremely pretty girl, with gentleness, modesty, taste, and feeling.
Half the sum of attraction, on either side, might have been enough, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) had nothing to do, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had hardly anybody to love; but the
encounter of such lavish recommendations could not fail.  They were
gradually acquainted, and when acquainted, rapidly and deeply in love.
It would be difficult to say which had seen highest perfection in the
other, or which had been the happiest: she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), in receiving his (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>)
declarations and proposals, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Domingo</b></font>) in having them accepted.

<p/>A short period of exquisite felicity followed, and but a short one.
Troubles soon arose.  Sir Walter, on being applied to, without actually
withholding his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) consent, or saying it should never be, gave it all the
negative of great astonishment, great coldness, great silence, and a
professed resolution of doing nothing for his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) daughter.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) thought it
a very degrading alliance; and Lady Russell, though with more tempered
and pardonable pride, received it as a most unfortunate one.

<p/>Anne Elliot, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) claims of birth, beauty, and mind, to throw
herself away at nineteen; involve herself at nineteen in an engagement
with a young man, who had nothing but himself to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), and no
hopes of attaining affluence, but in the chances of a most uncertain
profession, and no connexions to secure even his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) farther rise in the
profession, would be, indeed, a throwing away, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) grieved to
think of!  Anne Elliot, so young; known to so few, to be snatched off
by a stranger without alliance or fortune; or rather sunk by him (<font color='blue'><b>stranger</b></font>) into a
state of most wearing, anxious, youth-killing dependence!  It must not
be, if by any fair interference of friendship, any representations from
one who had almost a mother's love, and mother's rights, it would be
prevented.

<p/>Captain Wentworth had no fortune.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had been lucky in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) profession;
but spending freely, what had come freely, had realized nothing.  But
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was confident that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should soon be rich: full of life and ardour,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should soon have a ship, and soon be on a station that
would lead to everything he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wanted.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had always been lucky; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knew
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should be so still.  Such confidence, powerful in its own warmth,
and bewitching in the wit which often expressed it, must have been
enough for Anne; but Lady Russell saw it very differently.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
sanguine temper, and fearlessness of mind, operated very differently on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) saw in it but an aggravation of the evil.  It only added a
dangerous character to himself.  He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was brilliant, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was headstrong.
Lady Russell had little taste for wit, and of anything approaching to
imprudence a horror.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) deprecated the connexion in every light.

<p/>Such opposition, as these feelings produced, was more than Anne could
combat.  Young and gentle as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was, it might yet have been possible
to withstand her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's ill-will, though unsoftened by one kind word
or look on the part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister; but Lady Russell, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had
always loved and relied on, could not, with such steadiness of opinion,
and such tenderness of manner, be continually advising her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) in vain.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was persuaded to believe the engagement a wrong thing:  indiscreet,
improper, hardly capable of success, and not deserving it.  But it was
not a merely selfish caution, under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) acted, in putting an end
to it.  Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) not imagined herself consulting his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) good, even more
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) own, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could hardly have given him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) up.  The belief of being
prudent, and self-denying, principally for his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) advantage, was her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) chief
consolation, under the misery of a parting, a final parting; and every
consolation was required, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had to encounter all the additional
pain of opinions, on his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) side, totally unconvinced and unbending, and
of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) feeling himself ill used by so forced a relinquishment.  He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) had
left the country in consequence.

<p/>A few months had seen the beginning and the end of their acquaintance;
but not with a few months ended Anne's share of suffering from it.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
attachment and regrets had, for a long time, clouded every enjoyment of
youth, and an early loss of bloom and spirits had been their lasting
effect.

<p/>More than seven years were gone since this little history of sorrowful
interest had reached its close; and time had softened down much,
perhaps nearly all of peculiar attachment to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been too
dependent on time alone; no aid had been given in change of place
(except in one visit to Bath soon after the rupture), or in any novelty
or enlargement of society.  No one had ever come within the Kellynch
circle, who could bear a comparison with Frederick Wentworth, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
stood in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) memory.  No second attachment, the only thoroughly
natural, happy, and sufficient cure, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) time of life, had been
possible to the nice tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) mind, the fastidiousness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) taste,
in the small limits of the society around them.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been
solicited, when about two-and-twenty, to change her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) name, by the young
man, who not long afterwards found a more willing mind in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) younger
sister; and Lady Russell had lamented her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) refusal; for Charles Musgrove
was the eldest son of a man, whose landed property and general
importance were second in that country, only to Sir Walter's, and of
good character and appearance; and however Lady Russell might have
asked yet for something more, while Anne was nineteen, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have
rejoiced to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) at twenty-two so respectably removed from the
partialities and injustice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father's house, and settled so
permanently near herself.  But in this case, Anne had left nothing for
advice to do; and though Lady Russell, as satisfied as ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own discretion, never wished the past undone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) began now to have the
anxiety which borders on hopelessness for Anne's being tempted, by some
man of talents and independence, to enter a state for which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) held
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to be peculiarly fitted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) warm affections and domestic habits.

<p/>They knew not each other's opinion, either its constancy or its change,
on the one leading point of Anne's conduct, for the subject was never
alluded to; but Anne, at seven-and-twenty, thought very differently
from what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had been made to think at nineteen.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did not blame
Lady Russell, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) did not blame herself for having been guided by her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>);
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) felt that were any young person, in similar circumstances, to
apply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) for counsel, they would never receive any of such certain
immediate wretchedness, such uncertain future good.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was persuaded
that under every disadvantage of disapprobation at home, and every
anxiety attending his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) profession, all their probable fears, delays, and
disappointments, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) should yet have been a happier woman in
maintaining the engagement, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had been in the sacrifice of it;
and this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) fully believed, had the usual share, had even more than
the usual share of all such solicitudes and suspense been theirs,
without reference to the actual results of their case, which, as it
happened, would have bestowed earlier prosperity than could be
reasonably calculated on.  All his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) sanguine expectations, all his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>)
confidence had been justified.  His (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) genius and ardour had seemed to
foresee and to command his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) prosperous path.  He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had, very soon after
their engagement ceased, got employ: and all that he (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would
follow, had taken place.  He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) had distinguished himself, and early
gained the other step in rank, and must now, by successive captures,
have made a handsome fortune.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had only navy lists and newspapers
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) authority, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could not doubt his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) being rich; and, in
favour of his (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) constancy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had no reason to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) married.

<p/>How eloquent could Anne Elliot have been! how eloquent, at least, were
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wishes on the side of early warm attachment, and a cheerful
confidence in futurity, against that over-anxious caution which seems
to insult exertion and distrust Providence!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been forced into
prudence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youth, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) learned romance as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) grew older: the
natural sequel of an unnatural beginning.

<p/>With all these circumstances, recollections and feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could not
hear that Captain Wentworth's sister was likely to live at Kellynch
without a revival of former pain; and many a stroll, and many a sigh,
were necessary to dispel the agitation of the idea.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) often told
herself it was folly, before she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could harden her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) nerves sufficiently
to feel the continual discussion of the Crofts and their business no
evil.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was assisted, however, by that perfect indifference and
apparent unconsciousness, among the only three of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own friends in
the secret of the past, which seemed almost to deny any recollection of
it.  She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could do justice to the superiority of Lady Russell's motives
in this, over those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) father and Elizabeth; she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) could honour all
the better feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) calmness; but the general air of oblivion
among them was highly important from whatever it sprung; and in the
event of Admiral Croft's really taking Kellynch Hall, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) rejoiced anew
over the conviction which had always been most grateful to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), of the
past being known to those three only among her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) connexions, by whom no
syllable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) believed, would ever be whispered, and in the trust that
among his (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>), the brother only with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had been residing, had
received any information of their short-lived engagement.  That brother
had been long removed from the country and being a sensible man, and,
moreover, a single man at the time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had a fond dependence on no
human creature's having heard of it from him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>).

<p/>The sister, Mrs Croft, had then been out of England, accompanying her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
husband on a foreign station, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) own sister, Mary, had been at
school while it all occurred; and never admitted by the pride of some,
and the delicacy of others, to the smallest knowledge of it afterwards.

<p/>With these supports, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) hoped that the acquaintance between herself
and the Crofts, which, with Lady Russell, still resident in Kellynch,
and Mary fixed only three miles off, must be anticipated, need not
involve any particular awkwardness.
