<p/>The intercourse of the two families was at this period more nearly
restored to what it had been in the autumn, than any member of the old
intimacy had thought ever likely to be again. The return of Henry
Crawford, and the arrival of William Price, had much to do with it, but
much was still owing to Sir Thomas’s more than toleration of the
neighbourly attempts at the Parsonage. His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind, now disengaged from
the cares which had pressed on him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) at first, was at leisure to find the
Grants and their young inmates really worth visiting; and though
infinitely above scheming or contriving for any the most advantageous
matrimonial establishment that could be among the apparent
possibilities of any one most dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and disdaining even as a
littleness the being quick-sighted on such points, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could not avoid
perceiving, in a grand and careless way, that Mr. Crawford was somewhat
distinguishing his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece—nor perhaps refrain (though unconsciously)
from giving a more willing assent to invitations on that account.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) readiness, however, in agreeing to dine at the Parsonage, when the
general invitation was at last hazarded, after many debates and many
doubts as to whether it were worth while, <div class="bookquote">"because Sir Thomas seemed so
ill inclined, and Lady Bertram was so indolent!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>proceeded from
good-breeding and goodwill alone, and had nothing to do with Mr.
Crawford, but as being one in an agreeable group: for it was in the
course of that very visit that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) first began to think that any one in
the habit of such idle observations _would_ _have_ _thought_ that Mr.
Crawford was the admirer of Fanny Price.

<p/>The meeting was generally felt to be a pleasant one, being composed in
a good proportion of those who would talk and those who would listen;
and the dinner itself was elegant and plentiful, according to the usual
style of the Grants, and too much according to the usual habits of all
to raise any emotion except in Mrs. Norris, who could never behold
either the wide table or the number of dishes on it with patience, and
who did always contrive to experience some evil from the passing of the
servants behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) chair, and to bring away some fresh conviction of
its being impossible among so many dishes but that some must be cold.

<p/>In the evening it was found, according to the predetermination of Mrs.
Grant and her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister, that after making up the whist-table there would
remain sufficient for a round game, and everybody being as perfectly
complying and without a choice as on such occasions they always are,
speculation was decided on almost as soon as whist; and Lady Bertram
soon found herself in the critical situation of being applied to for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) own choice between the games, and being required either to draw a
card for whist or not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) hesitated. Luckily Sir Thomas was at hand.

<p/>"What shall I do, Sir Thomas? Whist and speculation; which will amuse
me most?"

<p/>Sir Thomas, after a moment’s thought, recommended speculation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was a
whist player himself, and perhaps might feel that it would not much
amuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to have her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) for a partner.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ladyship’s contented answer; "then speculation, if
you please, Mrs. Grant. I know nothing about it, but Fanny must teach
me."

<p/>Here Fanny interposed, however, with anxious protestations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
equal ignorance; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had never played the game nor seen it played in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life; and Lady Bertram felt a moment’s indecision again; but upon
everybody’s assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) that nothing could be so easy, that it was the
easiest game on the cards, and Henry Crawford’s stepping forward with a
most earnest request to be allowed to sit between her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) ladyship and Miss
Price, and teach them both, it was so settled; and Sir Thomas, Mrs.
Norris, and Dr. and Mrs. Grant being seated at the table of prime
intellectual state and dignity, the remaining six, under Miss
Crawford’s direction, were arranged round the other. It was a fine
arrangement for Henry Crawford, who was close to Fanny, and with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
hands full of business, having two persons’ cards to manage as well as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own; for though it was impossible for Fanny not to feel herself
mistress of the rules of the game in three minutes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had yet to
inspirit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) play, sharpen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) avarice, and harden her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart, which,
especially in any competition with William, was a work of some
difficulty; and as for Lady Bertram, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) must continue in charge of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) fame and fortune through the whole evening; and if quick enough to
keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) from looking at her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) cards when the deal began, must direct her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
in whatever was to be done with them to the end of it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was in high spirits, doing everything with happy ease, and
preeminent in all the lively turns, quick resources, and playful
impudence that could do honour to the game; and the round table was
altogether a very comfortable contrast to the steady sobriety and
orderly silence of the other.

<p/>Twice had Sir Thomas inquired into the enjoyment and success of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
lady, but in vain; no pause was long enough for the time his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) measured
manner needed; and very little of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) state could be known till Mrs.
Grant was able, at the end of the first rubber, to go to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and pay
her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) compliments.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope your ladyship is pleased with the game."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh dear, yes! very entertaining indeed. A very odd game. I do not know
what it is all about. I am never to see my cards; and Mr. Crawford does
all the rest."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Bertram,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Crawford, some time afterwards, taking the opportunity
of a little languor in the game, "I have never told you what happened
to me yesterday in my ride home.<div class="bookquote">" They had been hunting together, and
were in the midst of a good run, and at some distance from Mansfield,
when his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) horse being found to have flung a shoe, Henry Crawford had
been obliged to give up, and make the best of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) way back. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I told you
I lost my way after passing that old farmhouse with the yew-trees,
because I can never bear to ask; but I have not told you that, with my
usual luck—for I never do wrong without gaining by it—I found myself in
due time in the very place which I had a curiosity to see. I was
suddenly, upon turning the corner of a steepish downy field, in the
midst of a retired little village between gently rising hills; a small
stream before me to be forded, a church standing on a sort of knoll to
my right—which church was strikingly large and handsome for the place,
and not a gentleman or half a gentleman’s house to be seen excepting
one—to be presumed the Parsonage—within a stone’s throw of the said
knoll and church. I found myself, in short, in Thornton Lacey."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It sounds like it,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund; "but which way did you turn after
passing Sewell’s farm?"

<p/>"I answer no such irrelevant and insidious questions; though were I to
answer all that you could put in the course of an hour, you would never
be able to prove that it was _not_ Thornton Lacey—for such it certainly
was."

<p/>"You inquired, then?"

<p/>"No, I never inquire. But I _told_ a man mending a hedge that it was
Thornton Lacey, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) agreed to it."

<p/>"You have a good memory. I had forgotten having ever told you half so
much of the place.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Thornton Lacey was the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) impending living, as Miss Crawford
well knew; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) interest in a negotiation for William Price’s knave
increased.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>Well," continued Edmund, "and how did you like what you saw?"

<p/>"Very much indeed. You are a lucky fellow. There will be work for five
summers at least before the place is liveable."

<p/>"No, no, not so bad as that. The farmyard must be moved, I grant you;
but I am not aware of anything else. The house is by no means bad, and
when the yard is removed, there may be a very tolerable approach to
it."

<p/>"The farmyard must be cleared away entirely, and planted up to shut out
the blacksmith’s shop. The house must be turned to front the east
instead of the north—the entrance and principal rooms, I mean, must be
on that side, where the view is really very pretty; I am sure it may be
done. And _there_ must be your approach, through what is at present the
garden. You must make a new garden at what is now the back of the
house; which will be giving it the best aspect in the world, sloping to
the south-east. The ground seems precisely formed for it. I rode fifty
yards up the lane, between the church and the house, in order to look
about me; and saw how it might all be. Nothing can be easier. The
meadows beyond what _will_ _be_ the garden, as well as what now _is_,
sweeping round from the lane I stood in to the north-east, that is, to
the principal road through the village, must be all laid together, of
course; very pretty meadows they are, finely sprinkled with timber.
They belong to the living, I suppose; if not, you must purchase them.
Then the stream—something must be done with the stream; but I could not
quite determine what. I had two or three ideas."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I have two or three ideas also,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, "and one of them is,
that very little of your plan for Thornton Lacey will ever be put in
practice. I must be satisfied with rather less ornament and beauty. I
think the house and premises may be made comfortable, and given the air
of a gentleman’s residence, without any very heavy expense, and that
must suffice me; and, I hope, may suffice all who care about me."

<p/>Miss Crawford, a little suspicious and resentful of a certain tone of
voice, and a certain half-look attending the last expression of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
hope, made a hasty finish of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) dealings with William Price; and
securing his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) knave at an exorbitant rate, exclaimed, "There, I will
stake my last like a woman of spirit. No cold prudence for me. I am not
born to sit still and do nothing. If I lose the game, it shall not be
from not striving for it."

<p/>The game was hers, and only did not pay her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) for what she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had given to
secure it. Another deal proceeded, and Crawford began again about
Thornton Lacey.

<p/>"My plan may not be the best possible: I had not many minutes to form
it in; but you must do a good deal. The place deserves it, and you will
find yourself not satisfied with much less than it is capable of.
(Excuse me, your ladyship must not see your cards. There, let them lie
just before you.) The place deserves it, Bertram. You talk of giving it
the air of a gentleman’s residence. _That_ will be done by the removal
of the farmyard; for, independent of that terrible nuisance, I never
saw a house of the kind which had in itself so much the air of a
gentleman’s residence, so much the look of a something above a mere
parsonage-house—above the expenditure of a few hundreds a year. It is
not a scrambling collection of low single rooms, with as many roofs as
windows; it is not cramped into the vulgar compactness of a square
farmhouse: it is a solid, roomy, mansion-like looking house, such as
one might suppose a respectable old country family had lived in from
generation to generation, through two centuries at least, and were now
spending from two to three thousand a year in.<div class="bookquote">" Miss Crawford listened,
and Edmund agreed to this. " (<font color='red'><b>a gentleman</b></font>)</div>The air of a gentleman’s residence,
therefore, you cannot but give it, if you do anything. But it is
capable of much more. (Let me see, Mary; Lady Bertram bids a dozen for
that queen; no, no, a dozen is more than it is worth. Lady Bertram does
not bid a dozen. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) will have nothing to say to it. Go on, go on.) By
some such improvements as I have suggested (I do not really require you
to proceed upon my plan, though, by the bye, I doubt anybody’s striking
out a better) you may give it a higher character. You may raise it into
a _place_. From being the mere gentleman’s residence, it becomes, by
judicious improvement, the residence of a man of education, taste,
modern manners, good connexions. All this may be stamped on it; and
that house receive such an air as to make its owner be set down as the
great landholder of the parish by every creature travelling the road;
especially as there is no real squire’s house to dispute the point—a
circumstance, between ourselves, to enhance the value of such a
situation in point of privilege and independence beyond all
calculation. _You_ think with me, I hope" (turning with a softened
voice to Fanny). "Have you ever seen the place?"

<p/>Fanny gave a quick negative, and tried to hide her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) interest in the
subject by an eager attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, who was driving as hard a
bargain, and imposing on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could; but Crawford pursued
with "No, no, you must not part with the queen. You have bought her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) too
dearly, and your brother does not offer half her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) value. No, no, sir,
hands off, hands off. Your sister does not part with the queen. She (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) is
quite determined. The game will be yours," turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>queen</b></font>) again; "it
will certainly be yours."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And Fanny had much rather it were William’s,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, smiling at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). "Poor Fanny! not allowed to cheat herself as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishes!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>Mr. Bertram," said Miss Crawford, a few minutes afterwards, "you know
Henry to be such a capital improver, that you cannot possibly engage in
anything of the sort at Thornton Lacey without accepting his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) help. Only
think how useful he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) was at Sotherton! Only think what grand things were
produced there by our all going with him (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) one hot day in August to drive
about the grounds, and see his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) genius take fire. There we went, and
there we came home again; and what was done there is not to be told!"

<p/>Fanny’s eyes were turned on Crawford for a moment with an expression
more than grave—even reproachful; but on catching his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), were instantly
withdrawn. With something of consciousness he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) head at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
sister, and laughingly replied, <div class="bookquote">"I cannot say there was much done at
Sotherton; but it was a hot day, and we were all walking after each
other, and bewildered."  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>As soon as a general buzz gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) shelter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
added, in a low voice, directed solely at Fanny, "I should be sorry to
have my powers of _planning_ judged of by the day at Sotherton. I see
things very differently now. Do not think of me as I appeared then.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sotherton was a word to catch Mrs. Norris, and being just then in the
happy leisure which followed securing the odd trick by Sir Thomas’s
capital play and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own against Dr. and Mrs. Grant’s great hands, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
called out, in high good-humour, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Sotherton! Yes, that is a place,
indeed, and we had a charming day there. William, you are quite out of
luck; but the next time you come, I hope dear Mr. and Mrs. Rushworth
will be at home, and I am sure I can answer for your being kindly
received by both. Your cousins are not of a sort to forget their
relations, and Mr. Rushworth is a most amiable man. They are at
Brighton now, you know; in one of the best houses there, as Mr.
Rushworth’s fine fortune gives them a right to be. I do not exactly
know the distance, but when you get back to Portsmouth, if it is not
very far off, you ought to go over and pay your respects to them; and I
could send a little parcel by you that I want to get conveyed to your
cousins."

<p/>"I should be very happy, aunt; but Brighton is almost by Beachey Head;
and if I could get so far, I could not expect to be welcome in such a
smart place as that—poor scrubby midshipman as I am."

<p/>Mrs. Norris was beginning an eager assurance of the affability he (<font color='blue'><b>midshipman</b></font>) might
depend on, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was stopped by Sir Thomas’s saying with authority,
"I do not advise your going to Brighton, William, as I trust you may
soon have more convenient opportunities of meeting; but my daughters
would be happy to see their cousins anywhere; and you will find Mr.
Rushworth most sincerely disposed to regard all the connexions of our
family as his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would rather find him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) private secretary to the First Lord than
anything else,"  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>was William’s only answer, in an undervoice, not meant
to reach far, and the subject dropped.

<p/>As yet Sir Thomas had seen nothing to remark in Mr. Crawford’s
behaviour; but when the whist-table broke up at the end of the second
rubber, and leaving Dr. Grant and Mrs. Norris to dispute over their
last play, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) became a looker-on at the other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) found his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) niece the
object of attentions, or rather of professions, of a somewhat pointed
character.

<p/>Henry Crawford was in the first glow of another scheme about Thornton
Lacey; and not being able to catch Edmund’s ear, was detailing it to
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) fair neighbour with a look of considerable earnestness. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) scheme
was to rent the house himself the following winter, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) might have
a home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own in that neighbourhood; and it was not merely for the
use of it in the hunting-season (as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was then telling her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)), though
_that_ consideration had certainly some weight, feeling as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did that,
in spite of all Dr. Grant’s very great kindness, it was impossible for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) horses to be accommodated where they now were without
material inconvenience; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) attachment to that neighbourhood did
not depend upon one amusement or one season of the year: he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) had set his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
heart upon having a something there that he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) could come to at any time,
a little homestall at his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) command, where all the holidays of his (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) year
might be spent, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) might find himself continuing, improving, and
_perfecting_ that friendship and intimacy with the Mansfield Park
family which was increasing in value to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) every day. Sir Thomas heard
and was not offended. There was no want of respect in the young man’s
address; and Fanny’s reception of it was so proper and modest, so calm
and uninviting, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had nothing to censure in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) said little,
assented only here and there, and betrayed no inclination either of
appropriating any part of the compliment to herself, or of
strengthening his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) views in favour of Northamptonshire. Finding by whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was observed, Henry Crawford addressed himself on the same subject
to Sir Thomas, in a more everyday tone, but still with feeling.

<p/>"I want to be your neighbour, Sir Thomas, as you have, perhaps, heard
me telling Miss Price. May I hope for your acquiescence, and for your
not influencing your son against such a tenant?"

<p/>Sir Thomas, politely bowing, replied, "It is the only way, sir, in
which I could _not_ wish you established as a permanent neighbour; but
I hope, and believe, that Edmund will occupy his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) own house at Thornton
Lacey. Edmund, am I saying too much?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Edmund, on this appeal, had first to hear what was going on; but, on
understanding the question, was at no loss for an answer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Certainly, sir, I have no idea but of residence. But, Crawford, though
I refuse you as a tenant, come to me as a friend. Consider the house as
half your own every winter, and we will add to the stables on your own
improved plan, and with all the improvements of your improved plan that
may occur to you this spring."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We shall be the losers,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>continued Sir Thomas. "His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) going, though only
eight miles, will be an unwelcome contraction of our family circle; but
I should have been deeply mortified if any son of mine could reconcile
himself to doing less. It is perfectly natural that you should not have
thought much on the subject, Mr. Crawford. But a parish has wants and
claims which can be known only by a clergyman constantly resident, and
which no proxy can be capable of satisfying to the same extent. Edmund
might, in the common phrase, do the duty of Thornton, that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might
read prayers and preach, without giving up Mansfield Park: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might
ride over every Sunday, to a house nominally inhabited, and go through
divine service; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) might be the clergyman of Thornton Lacey every
seventh day, for three or four hours, if that would content him (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>). But it
will not. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) knows that human nature needs more lessons than a weekly
sermon can convey; and that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) does not live among his (<font color='blue'><b>Lacey</b></font>) parishioners,
and prove himself, by constant attention, their well-wisher and friend,
he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) does very little either for their good or his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) own.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Crawford bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acquiescence.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I repeat again," added Sir Thomas, "that Thornton Lacey is the only
house in the neighbourhood in which I should _not_ be happy to wait on
Mr. Crawford as occupier.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Crawford bowed his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thanks.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>Sir Thomas," said Edmund, "undoubtedly understands the duty of a
parish priest. We must hope his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) son may prove that _he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ knows it too."

<p/>Whatever effect Sir Thomas’s little harangue might really produce on
Mr. Crawford, it raised some awkward sensations in two of the others,
two of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) most attentive listeners—Miss Crawford and Fanny. One of
whom, having never before understood that Thornton was so soon and so
completely to be his (<font color='blue'><b>Thornton</b></font>) home, was pondering with downcast eyes on what it
would be _not_ to see Edmund every day; and the other, startled from
the agreeable fancies she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had been previously indulging on the strength
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother’s description, no longer able, in the picture she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
been forming of a future Thornton, to shut out the church, sink the
clergyman, and see only the respectable, elegant, modernised, and
occasional residence of a man of independent fortune, was considering
Sir Thomas, with decided ill-will, as the destroyer of all this, and
suffering the more from that involuntary forbearance which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
character and manner commanded, and from not daring to relieve herself
by a single attempt at throwing ridicule on his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) cause.

<p/>All the agreeable of _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ speculation was over for that hour. It was
time to have done with cards, if sermons prevailed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was glad to
find it necessary to come to a conclusion, and be able to refresh her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
spirits by a change of place and neighbour.

<p/>The chief of the party were now collected irregularly round the fire,
and waiting the final break-up. William and Fanny were the most
detached. They remained together at the otherwise deserted card-table,
talking very comfortably, and not thinking of the rest, till some of
the rest began to think of them. Henry Crawford’s chair was the first
to be given a direction towards them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sat silently observing
them for a few minutes; himself, in the meanwhile, observed by Sir
Thomas, who was standing in chat with Dr. Grant.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is the assembly night,"  (<font color='red'><b>William/William Price</b></font>)</div>said William. <div class="bookquote">"If I were at Portsmouth I
should be at it, perhaps."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"But you do not wish yourself at Portsmouth, William?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div><p/>"No, Fanny, that I do not. I shall have enough of Portsmouth and of
dancing too, when I cannot have you. And I do not know that there would
be any good in going to the assembly, for I might not get a partner.
The Portsmouth girls turn up their noses at anybody who has not a
commission. One might as well be nothing as a midshipman. One _is_
nothing, indeed. You remember the Gregorys; they are grown up amazing
fine girls, but they will hardly speak to _me_, because Lucy is courted
by a lieutenant."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! shame, shame! But never mind it, William"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>(her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) own cheeks in a
glow of indignation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) spoke). "It is not worth minding. It is no
reflection on _you_; it is no more than what the greatest admirals have
all experienced, more or less, in their time. You must think of that,
you must try to make up your mind to it as one of the hardships which
fall to every sailor’s share, like bad weather and hard living, only
with this advantage, that there will be an end to it, that there will
come a time when you will have nothing of that sort to endure. When you
are a lieutenant! only think, William, when you are a lieutenant, how
little you will care for any nonsense of this kind."

<p/>"I begin to think I shall never be a lieutenant, Fanny. Everybody gets
made but me."

<p/>"Oh! my dear William, do not talk so; do not be so desponding. My uncle
says nothing, but I am sure he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will do everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) power to get
you made. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) knows, as well as you do, of what consequence it is.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was checked by the sight of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle much nearer to them than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had any suspicion of, and each found it necessary to talk of something
else.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>Are you fond of dancing, Fanny?"

<p/>"Yes, very; only I am soon tired."

<p/>"I should like to go to a ball with you and see you dance. Have you
never any balls at Northampton? I should like to see you dance, and I’d
dance with you if you _would_, for nobody would know who I was here,
and I should like to be your partner once more. We used to jump about
together many a time, did not we? when the hand-organ was in the
street? I am a pretty good dancer in my way, but I dare say you are a
better." And turning to his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) uncle, who was now close to them, "Is not
Fanny a very good dancer, sir?"

<p/>Fanny, in dismay at such an unprecedented question, did not know which
way to look, or how to be prepared for the answer. Some very grave
reproof, or at least the coldest expression of indifference, must be
coming to distress her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) brother, and sink her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to the ground. But, on the
contrary, it was no worse than, "I am sorry to say that I am unable to
answer your question. I have never seen Fanny dance since she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a
little girl; but I trust we shall both think she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) acquits herself like a
gentlewoman when we do see her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which, perhaps, we may have an
opportunity of doing ere long."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have had the pleasure of seeing your sister dance, Mr. Price,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry Crawford/Henry</b></font>)</div>said
Henry Crawford, leaning forward, "and will engage to answer every
inquiry which you can make on the subject, to your entire satisfaction.
But I believe" (seeing Fanny looked distressed) "it must be at some
other time. There is _one_ person in company who does not like to have
Miss Price spoken of."

<p/>True enough, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had once seen Fanny dance; and it was equally true that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would now have answered for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) gliding about with quiet, light
elegance, and in admirable time; but, in fact, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not for the
life of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) recall what her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dancing had been, and rather took it for
granted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been present than remembered anything about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) passed, however, for an admirer of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dancing; and Sir Thomas, by
no means displeased, prolonged the conversation on dancing in general,
and was so well engaged in describing the balls of Antigua, and
listening to what his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) nephew could relate of the different modes of
dancing which had fallen within his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) observation, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had not heard
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) carriage announced, and was first called to the knowledge of it by
the bustle of Mrs. Norris.

<p/>"Come, Fanny, Fanny, what are you about? We are going. Do not you see
your aunt is going? Quick, quick! I cannot bear to keep good old Wilcox
waiting. You should always remember the coachman and horses. My dear
Sir Thomas, we have settled it that the carriage should come back for
you, and Edmund and William."

<p/>Sir Thomas could not dissent, as it had been his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own arrangement,
previously communicated to his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wife and sister; but _that_ seemed
forgotten by Mrs. Norris, who must fancy that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) settled it all
herself.

<p/>Fanny’s last feeling in the visit was disappointment: for the shawl
which Edmund was quietly taking from the servant to bring and put round
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) shoulders was seized by Mr. Crawford’s quicker hand, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
obliged to be indebted to his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) more prominent attention.
