<p/>Jane Fairfax was an orphan, the only child of Mrs. Bates's youngest daughter.

<p/>The marriage of Lieut. Fairfax of the   regiment of infantry, and Miss Jane Bates, had had its day of fame and pleasure, hope and interest; but nothing now remained of it, save the melancholy remembrance of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) dying in action abroad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) widow sinking under consumption and grief soon afterwards and this girl.

<p/>By birth she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) belonged to Highbury: and when at three years old, on losing her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) became the property, the charge, the consolation, the foundling of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) grandmother and aunt, there had seemed every probability of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being permanently fixed there; of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) being taught only what very limited means could command, and growing up with no advantages of connexion or improvement, to be engrafted on what nature had given her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in a pleasing person, good understanding, and warm-hearted, well-meaning relations.

<p/>But the compassionate feelings of a friend of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) father gave a change to her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) destiny. This was Colonel Campbell, who had very highly regarded Fairfax, as an excellent officer and most deserving young man; and farther, had been indebted to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for such attentions, during a severe camp-fever, as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) believed had saved his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) life. These were claims which he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not learn to overlook, though some years passed away from the death of poor Fairfax, before his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own return to England put any thing in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) power. When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did return, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sought out the child and took notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was a married man, with only one living child, a girl, about Jane's age: and Jane became their guest, paying them long visits and growing a favourite with all; and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was nine years old, his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) daughter's great fondness for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>guest</b></font>) own wish of being a real friend, united to produce an offer from Colonel Campbell of undertaking the whole charge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) education. It was accepted; and from that period Jane had belonged to Colonel Campbell's family, and had lived with them entirely, only visiting her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) grandmother from time to time.

<p/>The plan was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) should be brought up for educating others; the very few hundred pounds which she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) inherited from her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) father making independence impossible. To provide for her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) otherwise was out of Colonel Campbell's power; for though his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) income, by pay and appointments, was handsome, his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) fortune was moderate and must be all his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) daughter's; but, by giving her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) an education, he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) hoped to be supplying the means of respectable subsistence hereafter.

<p/>Such was Jane Fairfax's history. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fallen into good hands, known nothing but kindness from the Campbells, and been given an excellent education. Living constantly with right-minded and well-informed people, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) heart and understanding had received every advantage of discipline and culture; and Colonel Campbell's residence being in London, every lighter talent had been done full justice to, by the attendance of first-rate masters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) disposition and abilities were equally worthy of all that friendship could do; and at eighteen or nineteen she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was, as far as such an early age can be qualified for the care of children, fully competent to the office of instruction herself; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was too much beloved to be parted with. Neither father nor mother could promote, and the daughter could not endure it. The evil day was put off. It was easy to decide that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was still too young; and Jane remained with them, sharing, as another daughter, in all the rational pleasures of an elegant society, and a judicious mixture of home and amusement, with only the drawback of the future, the sobering suggestions of her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) own good understanding to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) that all this might soon be over.

<p/>The affection of the whole family, the warm attachment of Miss Campbell in particular, was the more honourable to each party from the circumstance of Jane's decided superiority both in beauty and acquirements. That nature had given it in feature could not be unseen by the young woman, nor could her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) higher powers of mind be unfelt by the parents. They continued together with unabated regard however, till the marriage of Miss Campbell, who by that chance, that luck which so often defies anticipation in matrimonial affairs, giving attraction to what is moderate rather than to what is superior, engaged the affections of Mr. Dixon, a young man, rich and agreeable, almost as soon as they were acquainted; and was eligibly and happily settled, while Jane Fairfax had yet her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) bread to earn.

<p/>This event had very lately taken place; too lately for any thing to be yet attempted by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) less fortunate friend towards entering on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) path of duty; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had now reached the age which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own judgment had fixed on for beginning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had long resolved that one-and-twenty should be the period. With the fortitude of a devoted novitiate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had resolved at one-and-twenty to complete the sacrifice, and retire from all the pleasures of life, of rational intercourse, equal society, peace and hope, to penance and mortification for ever.

<p/>The good sense of Colonel and Mrs. Campbell could not oppose such a resolution, though their feelings did. As long as they lived, no exertions would be necessary, their home might be hers for ever; and for their own comfort they would have retained her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) wholly; but this would be selfishness: what must be at last, had better be soon. Perhaps they began to feel it might have been kinder and wiser to have resisted the temptation of any delay, and spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) from a taste of such enjoyments of ease and leisure as must now be relinquished. Still, however, affection was glad to catch at any reasonable excuse for not hurrying on the wretched moment. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had never been quite well since the time of their daughter's marriage; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) should have completely recovered her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) usual strength, they must forbid her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) engaging in duties, which, so far from being compatible with a weakened frame and varying spirits, seemed, under the most favourable circumstances, to require something more than human perfection of body and mind to be discharged with tolerable comfort.

<p/>With regard to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) not accompanying them to Ireland, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) account to her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) aunt contained nothing but truth, though there might be some truths not told. It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) own choice to give the time of their absence to Highbury; to spend, perhaps, her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) last months of perfect liberty with those kind relations to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was so very dear: and the Campbells, whatever might be their motive or motives, whether single, or double, or treble, gave the arrangement their ready sanction, and said, that they depended more on a few months spent in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) native air, for the recovery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) health, than on any thing else. Certain it was that she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was to come; and that Highbury, instead of welcoming that perfect novelty which had been so long promised it Mr. Frank Churchill must put up for the present with Jane Fairfax, who could bring only the freshness of a two years' absence.

<p/>Emma was sorry; to have to pay civilities to a person she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like through three long months! to be always doing more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished, and less than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought! Why she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not like Jane Fairfax might be a difficult question to answer; Mr. Knightley had once told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) it was because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) saw in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) the really accomplished young woman, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) wanted to be thought herself; and though the accusation had been eagerly refuted at the time, there were moments of self-examination in which her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) conscience could not quite acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>). But "she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could never get acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>): she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did not know how it was, but there was such coldness and reserve such apparent indifference whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) pleased or not and then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt was such an eternal talker! and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was made such a fuss with by every body! and it had been always imagined that they were to be so intimate because their ages were the same, every body had supposed they must be so fond of each other." These were her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) reasons she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no better.

<p/>It was a dislike so little just every imputed fault was so magnified by fancy, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) never saw Jane Fairfax the first time after any considerable absence, without feeling that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>); and now, when the due visit was paid, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) arrival, after a two years' interval, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was particularly struck with the very appearance and manners, which for those two whole years she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had been depreciating. Jane Fairfax was very elegant, remarkably elegant; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had herself the highest value for elegance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) height was pretty, just such as almost every body would think tall, and nobody could think very tall; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) figure particularly graceful; her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) size a most becoming medium, between fat and thin, though a slight appearance of ill-health seemed to point out the likeliest evil of the two. Emma could not but feel all this; and then, her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) features there was more beauty in them altogether than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had remembered; it was not regular, but it was very pleasing beauty. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes, a deep grey, with dark eye-lashes and eyebrows, had never been denied their praise; but the skin, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been used to cavil at, as wanting colour, had a clearness and delicacy which really needed no fuller bloom. It was a style of beauty, of which elegance was the reigning character, and as such, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must, in honour, by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) principles, admire it: elegance, which, whether of person or of mind, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw so little in Highbury. There, not to be vulgar, was distinction, and merit.

<p/>In short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sat, during the first visit, looking at Jane Fairfax with twofold complacency; the sense of pleasure and the sense of rendering justice, and was determining that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would dislike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) no longer. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) took in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) history, indeed, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) situation, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) beauty; when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) considered what all this elegance was destined to, what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was going to sink from, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was going to live, it seemed impossible to feel any thing but compassion and respect; especially, if to every well-known particular entitling her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) to interest, were added the highly probable circumstance of an attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had so naturally started to herself. In that case, nothing could be more pitiable or more honourable than the sacrifices she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had resolved on. Emma was very willing now to acquit her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of having seduced Mr. Dixon's actions from his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) wife, or of any thing mischievous which her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) imagination had suggested at first. If it were love, it might be simple, single, successless love on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) side alone. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might have been unconsciously sucking in the sad poison, while a sharer of his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend; and from the best, the purest of motives, might now be denying herself this visit to Ireland, and resolving to divide herself effectually from him (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) and his (<font color='blue'><b>sharer</b></font>) connexions by soon beginning her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) career of laborious duty.

<p/>Upon the whole, Emma left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with such softened, charitable feelings, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) look around in walking home, and lament that Highbury afforded no young man worthy of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) independence; nobody that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could wish to scheme about for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).

<p/>These were charming feelings but not lasting. Before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had committed herself by any public profession of eternal friendship for Jane Fairfax, or done more towards a recantation of past prejudices and errors, than saying to Mr. Knightley, <div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) certainly is handsome; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is better than handsome!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>Jane had spent an evening at Hartfield with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) grandmother and aunt, and every thing was relapsing much into its usual state. Former provocations reappeared. The aunt was as tiresome as ever; more tiresome, because anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) health was now added to admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) powers; and they had to listen to the description of exactly how little bread and butter she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) ate for breakfast, and how small a slice of mutton for dinner, as well as to see exhibitions of new caps and new workbags for her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) mother and herself; and Jane's offences rose again. They had music; Emma was obliged to play; and the thanks and praise which necessarily followed appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) an affectation of candour, an air of greatness, meaning only to shew off in higher style her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own very superior performance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was, besides, which was the worst of all, so cold, so cautious! There was no getting at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) real opinion. Wrapt up in a cloak of politeness, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed determined to hazard nothing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was disgustingly, was suspiciously reserved.

<p/>If any thing could be more, where all was most, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more reserved on the subject of Weymouth and the Dixons than any thing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) seemed bent on giving no real insight into Mr. Dixon's character, or her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own value for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) company, or opinion of the suitableness of the match. It was all general approbation and smoothness; nothing delineated or distinguished. It did her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) no service however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) caution was thrown away. Emma saw its artifice, and returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first surmises. There probably was something more to conceal than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own preference; Mr. Dixon, perhaps, had been very near changing one friend for the other, or been fixed only to Miss Campbell, for the sake of the future twelve thousand pounds.

<p/>The like reserve prevailed on other topics. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) and Mr. Frank Churchill had been at Weymouth at the same time. It was known that they were a little acquainted; but not a syllable of real information could Emma procure as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) truly was. <div class="bookquote">"Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) handsome?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was reckoned a very fine young man."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"Was he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) agreeable?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was generally thought so."  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><div class="bookquote">"Did he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) appear a sensible young man; a young man of information?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>"At a watering-place, or in a common London acquaintance, it was difficult to decide on such points. Manners were all that could be safely judged of, under a much longer knowledge than they had yet had of Mr. Churchill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) believed every body found his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manners pleasing." Emma could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>).
