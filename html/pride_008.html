<p/>At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past
six Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil enquiries
which then poured in, and amongst which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the pleasure of
distinguishing the much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley’s, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could not make a very favourable answer. Jane was by no means
better. The sisters, on hearing this, repeated three or four
times how much they were grieved, how shocking it was to have a
bad cold, and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves;
and then thought no more of the matter: and their indifference
towards Jane when not immediately before them restored Elizabeth
to the enjoyment of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former dislike.

<p/>Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could regard with any complacency. His (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) anxiety for Jane was
evident, and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) attentions to herself most pleasing, and they
prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) feeling herself so much an intruder as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) believed
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was considered by the others. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had very little notice from
any but him (<font color='blue'><b>intruder</b></font>). Miss Bingley was engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister
scarcely less so; and as for Mr. Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)
was an indolent man, who lived only to eat, drink, and play at
cards; who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to prefer a plain dish to a ragout,
had nothing to say to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/>When dinner was over, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) returned directly to Jane, and Miss
Bingley began abusing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was out of the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed, a mixture of pride
and impertinence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no conversation, no style, no beauty.
Mrs. Hurst thought the same, and added:

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) has nothing, in short, to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>), but being an
excellent walker. I shall never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) appearance this
morning. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) really looked almost wild."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) did, indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance.
Very nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)_ be scampering
about the country, because her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister had a cold? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) hair, so
untidy, so blowsy!"

<p/>"Yes, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) petticoat; I hope you saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) petticoat, six inches
deep in mud, I am absolutely certain; and the gown which had been
let down to hide it not doing its office."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley; "but this
was all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked
remarkably well when she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) came into the room this morning. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley;
"and I am inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your
sister_ make such an exhibition."

<p/>"Certainly not."

<p/>"To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever
it is, above her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) ankles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! What
could she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) mean by it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort
of conceited independence, a most country-town indifference to
decorum."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It shows an affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) sister that is very pleasing,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley.

<p/>"I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,<div class="bookquote">" observed Miss Bingley in a half
whisper, " (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>that this adventure has rather affected your admiration
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) fine eyes."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Not at all,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied; "they were brightened by the exercise."
A short pause followed this speech, and Mrs. Hurst began again:

<p/>"I have an excessive regard for Miss Jane Bennet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is really a
very sweet girl, and I wish with all my heart she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) were well
settled. But with such a father and mother, and such low
connections, I am afraid there is no chance of it."

<p/>"I think I have heard you say that their uncle is an attorney in
Meryton."

<p/>"Yes; and they have another, who lives somewhere near Cheapside."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is capital,"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>added her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) sister, and they both laughed
heartily.

<p/>"If they had uncles enough to fill _all_ Cheapside,<div class="bookquote">" cried
Bingley, " (<font color='red'><b>uncles</b></font>)</div>it would not make them one jot less agreeable."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But it must very materially lessen their chance of marrying men
of any consideration in the world,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy.

<p/>To this speech Bingley made no answer; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sisters gave it
their hearty assent, and indulged their mirth for some time at
the expense of their dear friend’s vulgar relations.

<p/>With a renewal of tenderness, however, they returned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) room
on leaving the dining-parlour, and sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) till summoned to
coffee. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was still very poorly, and Elizabeth would not quit
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) at all, till late in the evening, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had the comfort of
seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sleep, and when it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) rather right than
pleasant that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) should go downstairs herself. On entering the
drawing-room she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) found the whole party at loo, and was
immediately invited to join them; but suspecting them to be
playing high she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) declined it, and making her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister the excuse,
said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would amuse herself for the short time she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could stay
below, with a book. Mr. Hurst looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with astonishment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do you prefer reading to cards?"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>); <div class="bookquote">"that is rather
singular."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Eliza Bennet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, "despises cards. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is a
great reader, and has no pleasure in anything else."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I deserve neither such praise nor such censure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Elizabeth Bennet/Elizabeth Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried
Elizabeth; "I am _not_ a great reader, and I have pleasure in
many things."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"In nursing your sister I am sure you have pleasure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said
Bingley; "and I hope it will be soon increased by seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
quite well."

<p/>Elizabeth thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) heart, and then walked towards the
table where a few books were lying. He (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) immediately offered to
fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) others—all that his (<font color='blue'><b>reader</b></font>) library afforded.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I wish my collection were larger for your benefit and my own
credit; but I am an idle fellow, and though I have not many, I
have more than I ever looked into."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Elizabeth Bennet/Elizabeth Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth assured him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could suit herself perfectly with
those in the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am astonished,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, "that my father should have
left so small a collection of books. What a delightful library
you have at Pemberley, Mr. Darcy!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It ought to be good,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) replied, "it has been the work of many
generations."

<p/>"And then you have added so much to it yourself, you are always
buying books."

<p/>"I cannot comprehend the neglect of a family library in such days
as these."

<p/>"Neglect! I am sure you neglect nothing that can add to the
beauties of that noble place. Charles, when you build _your_
house, I wish it may be half as delightful as Pemberley."

<p/>"I wish it may."

<p/>"But I would really advise you to make your purchase in that
neighbourhood, and take Pemberley for a kind of model. There is
not a finer county in England than Derbyshire."

<p/>"With all my heart; I will buy Pemberley itself if Darcy will
sell it."

<p/>"I am talking of possibilities, Charles."

<p/>"Upon my word, Caroline, I should think it more possible to get
Pemberley by purchase than by imitation.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth was so much caught with what passed, as to leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
very little attention for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) book; and soon laying it wholly
aside, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) drew near the card-table, and stationed herself
between Mr. Bingley and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eldest sister, to observe the game.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Darcy</b></font>)</div>Is Miss Darcy much grown since the spring?" said Miss Bingley;
"will she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) be as tall as I am?"

<p/>"I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) will. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is now about Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s
height, or rather taller."

<p/>"How I long to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) again! I never met with anybody who
delighted me so much. Such a countenance, such manners! And so
extremely accomplished for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) age! Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) performance on the
pianoforte is exquisite."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is amazing to me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Bingley, "how young ladies can have
patience to be so very accomplished as they all are."

<p/>"All young ladies accomplished! My dear Charles, what do you
mean?"

<p/>"Yes, all of them, I think. They all paint tables, cover screens,
and net purses. I scarcely know anyone who cannot do all this,
and I am sure I never heard a young lady spoken of for the first
time, without being informed that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was very accomplished."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Your list of the common extent of accomplishments,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy,
"has too much truth. The word is applied to many a woman who
deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a
screen. But I am very far from agreeing with you in your
estimation of ladies in general. I cannot boast of knowing more
than half-a-dozen, in the whole range of my acquaintance, that
are really accomplished."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nor I, I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley.

<p/>"Then," observed Elizabeth, "you must comprehend a great deal in
your idea of an accomplished woman."

<p/>"Yes, I do comprehend a great deal in it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>assistant</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) faithful assistant, "no one can be
really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is
usually met with. A woman must have a thorough knowledge of
music, singing, drawing, dancing, and the modern languages, to
deserve the word; and besides all this, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must possess a
certain something in her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) air and manner of walking, the tone of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) voice, her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) address and expressions, or the word will be but
half-deserved."

<p/>"All this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) must possess,<div class="bookquote">" added Darcy, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and to all this she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
must yet add something more substantial, in the improvement of
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) mind by extensive reading."

<p/>"I am no longer surprised at your knowing _only_ six accomplished
women. I rather wonder now at your knowing _any_."

<p/>"Are you so severe upon your own sex as to doubt the possibility
of all this?"

<p/>"_I_ never saw such a woman. _I_ never saw such capacity, and
taste, and application, and elegance, as you describe united."

<p/>Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley both cried out against the injustice
of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) implied doubt, and were both protesting that they knew
many women who answered this description, when Mr. Hurst called
them to order, with bitter complaints of their inattention to
what was going forward. As all conversation was thereby at an
end, Elizabeth soon afterwards left the room.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Elizabeth Bennet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>said Miss Bingley, when the door was closed
on her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), "is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend
themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own; and with
many men, I dare say, it succeeds. But, in my opinion, it is a
paltry device, a very mean art."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Undoubtedly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Darcy/Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div>replied Darcy, to whom this remark was chiefly
addressed, "there is a meanness in _all_ the arts which ladies
sometimes condescend to employ for captivation. Whatever bears
affinity to cunning is despicable."

<p/>Miss Bingley was not so entirely satisfied with this reply as to
continue the subject.

<p/>Elizabeth joined them again only to say that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister was
worse, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Bingley urged Mr. Jones
being sent for immediately; while his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sisters, convinced that no
country advice could be of any service, recommended an express to
town for one of the most eminent physicians. This she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) would not
hear of; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was not so unwilling to comply with their
brother’s proposal; and it was settled that Mr. Jones should be
sent for early in the morning, if Miss Bennet were not decidedly
better. Bingley was quite uncomfortable; his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) sisters declared
that they were miserable. They solaced their wretchedness,
however, by duets after supper, while he (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) could find no better
relief to his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) feelings than by giving his (<font color='blue'><b>Jones</b></font>) housekeeper directions
that every attention might be paid to the sick lady and her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)
sister.
