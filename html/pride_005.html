<p/>Within a short walk of Longbourn lived a family with whom the
Bennets were particularly intimate. Sir William Lucas had been
formerly in trade in Meryton, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) had made a tolerable
fortune, and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to
the king during his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) mayoralty. The distinction had perhaps been
felt too strongly. It had given him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) a disgust to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) business,
and to his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) residence in a small market town; and, in quitting
them both, he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) had removed with his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) family to a house about a mile
from Meryton, denominated from that period Lucas Lodge, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
could think with pleasure of his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) own importance, and, unshackled
by business, occupy himself solely in being civil to all the
world. For, though elated by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) rank, it did not render him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
supercilious; on the contrary, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was all attention to everybody.
By nature inoffensive, friendly, and obliging, his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) presentation
at St. James’s had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) courteous.

<p/>Lady Lucas was a very good kind of woman, not too clever to be a
valuable neighbour to Mrs. Bennet. They had several children. The
eldest of them, a sensible, intelligent young woman, about
twenty-seven, was Elizabeth’s intimate friend.

<p/>That the Miss Lucases and the Miss Bennets should meet to talk
over a ball was absolutely necessary; and the morning after the
assembly brought the former to Longbourn to hear and to
communicate.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_You_ began the evening well, Charlotte,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet with
civil self-command to Miss Lucas. <div class="bookquote">"_You_ were Mr. Bingley’s first
choice."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) seemed to like his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) second better."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! you mean Jane, I suppose, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) danced with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) twice.
To be sure that _did_ seem as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)—indeed I rather
believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) _did_—I heard something about it—but I hardly know
what—something about Mr. Robinson."

<p/>"Perhaps you mean what I overheard between him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) and Mr. Robinson;
did not I mention it to you? Mr. Robinson’s asking him (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) how he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
liked our Meryton assemblies, and whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) did not think there
were a great many pretty women in the room, and _which_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>)
thought the prettiest? and his (<font color='blue'><b>Robinson</b></font>) answering immediately to the last
question: <div class="bookquote">‘Oh! the eldest Miss Bennet, beyond a doubt; there
cannot be two opinions on that point.’ (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>"

<p/>"Upon my word! Well, that is very decided indeed—that does seem
as if—but, however, it may all come to nothing, you know."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_My_ overhearings were more to the purpose than _yours_, Eliza,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte. "Mr. Darcy is not so well worth listening to as
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?—poor Eliza!—to be only just _tolerable_."

<p/>"I beg you would not put it into Lizzy’s head to be vexed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
ill-treatment, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is such a disagreeable man, that it would
be quite a misfortune to be liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Mrs. Long told me last
night that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sat close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) for half-an-hour without once
opening his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) lips."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Are you quite sure, ma’am?—is not there a little mistake?"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said
Jane. "I certainly saw Mr. Darcy speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)."

<p/>"Aye—because she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) at last how he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) liked Netherfield, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could not help answering her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed quite
angry at being spoke to."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Bingley told me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) never speaks much,
unless among his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) intimate acquaintances. With _them_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is
remarkably agreeable."

<p/>"I do not believe a word of it, my dear. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been so very
agreeable, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have talked to Mrs. Long. But I can guess how
it was; everybody says that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is eat up with pride, and I dare
say he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had heard somehow that Mrs. Long does not keep a carriage,
and had come to the ball in a hack chaise."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not mind his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) not talking to Mrs. Long,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas/Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas,
"but I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had danced with Eliza."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Another time, Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) mother, "I would not dance with
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_, if I were you."

<p/>"I believe, ma’am, I may safely promise you _never_ to dance with
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) pride,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas/Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas, "does not offend _me_ so much as
pride often does, because there is an excuse for it. One cannot
wonder that so very fine a young man, with family, fortune,
everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour, should think highly of himself. If I
may so express it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has a _right_ to be proud."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is very true,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, "and I could easily
forgive _his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ pride, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had not mortified _mine_."

<p/>"Pride,<div class="bookquote">" observed Mary, who piqued herself upon the solidity of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reflections, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>is a very common failing, I believe. By all
that I have ever read, I am convinced that it is very common
indeed; that human nature is particularly prone to it, and that
there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of
self-complacency on the score of some quality or other, real or
imaginary. Vanity and pride are different things, though the
words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without
being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves,
vanity to what we would have others think of us."

<p/>"If I were as rich as Mr. Darcy," cried a young Lucas, who came
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sisters, "I should not care how proud I was. I would
keep a pack of foxhounds, and drink a bottle of wine a day."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Then you would drink a great deal more than you ought,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said
Mrs. Bennet; "and if I were to see you at it, I should take away
your bottle directly."

<p/>The boy protested that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) should not; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) continued to declare
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would, and the argument ended only with the visit.
