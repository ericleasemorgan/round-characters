<p/>Mrs. Dashwood did not hear unmoved the vindication of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) former
favourite. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) rejoiced in his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) being cleared from some part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
imputed guilt;—she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was sorry for him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>);—she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wished him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) happy. But the
feelings of the past could not be recalled.—Nothing could restore him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
with a faith unbroken—a character unblemished, to Marianne. Nothing
could do away the knowledge of what the latter had suffered through his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
means, nor remove the guilt of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) conduct towards Eliza. Nothing could
replace him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>), therefore, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) former esteem, nor injure the interests
of Colonel Brandon.

<p/>Had Mrs. Dashwood, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter, heard Willoughby’s story from
himself—had she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) witnessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) distress, and been under the influence of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) manner, it is probable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) compassion
would have been greater. But it was neither in Elinor’s power, nor in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wish, to rouse such feelings in another, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) retailed
explanation, as had at first been called forth in herself. Reflection
had given calmness to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) judgment, and sobered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own opinion of
Willoughby’s deserts;—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished, therefore, to declare only the simple
truth, and lay open such facts as were really due to his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character,
without any embellishment of tenderness to lead the fancy astray.

<p/>In the evening, when they were all three together, Marianne began
voluntarily to speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again;—but that it was not without an
effort, the restless, unquiet thoughtfulness in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been for
some time previously sitting—her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) rising colour, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) spoke,—and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
unsteady voice, plainly showed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wish to assure you both,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), "that I see every thing—as you
can desire me to do."

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood would have interrupted her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) instantly with soothing
tenderness, had not Elinor, who really wished to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s
unbiased opinion, by an eager sign, engaged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) silence. Marianne
slowly continued,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a great relief to me—what Elinor told me this morning—I have now
heard exactly what I wished to hear." (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>—For some moments her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) voice was
lost; but recovering herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) added, and with greater calmness than
before—"I am now perfectly satisfied, I wish for no change. I never
could have been happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), after knowing, as sooner or later I
must have known, all this.—I should have had no confidence, no esteem.
Nothing could have done it away to my feelings."

<p/>"I know it—I know it,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Happy with a man of libertine
practices!—With one who so injured the peace of the dearest of our
friends, and the best of men!—No—my Marianne has not a heart to be made
happy with such a man!—Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) conscience, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sensitive conscience, would
have felt all that the conscience of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) husband ought to have felt."

<p/>Marianne sighed, and repeated, "I wish for no change."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You consider the matter,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "exactly as a good mind and a
sound understanding must consider it; and I dare say you perceive, as
well as myself, not only in this, but in many other circumstances,
reason enough to be convinced that your marriage must have involved you
in many certain troubles and disappointments, in which you would have
been poorly supported by an affection, on his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) side, much less certain.
Had you married, you must have been always poor. His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) expensiveness is
acknowledged even by himself, and his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) whole conduct declares that
self-denial is a word hardly understood by him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) demands and your
inexperience together, on a small, very small income, must have brought
on distresses which would not be the _less_ grievous to you, from
having been entirely unknown and unthought of before. _Your_ sense of
honour and honesty would have led you, I know, when aware of your
situation, to attempt all the economy that would appear to you
possible: and, perhaps, as long as your frugality retrenched only on
your own comfort, you might have been suffered to practice it, but
beyond that—and how little could the utmost of your single management
do to stop the ruin which had begun before your marriage? Beyond
_that_, had you endeavoured, however reasonably, to abridge _his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>)_
enjoyments, is it not to be feared, that instead of prevailing on
feelings so selfish to consent to it, you would have lessened your own
influence on his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) heart, and made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) regret the connection which had
involved him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) in such difficulties?"

<p/>Marianne’s lips quivered, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) repeated the word "Selfish?" in a
tone that implied—"do you really think him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) selfish?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) behaviour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, "from the beginning to
the end of the affair, has been grounded on selfishness. It was
selfishness which first made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) sport with your affections; which
afterwards, when his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) own were engaged, made him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) delay the confession of
it, and which finally carried him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) from Barton. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own enjoyment, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) own ease, was, in every particular, his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) ruling principle."

<p/>"It is very true. _My_ happiness never was his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) object."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"At present,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>continued Elinor, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regrets what he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has done. And why
does he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) regret it?—Because he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) finds it has not answered towards
himself. It has not made him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) happy. His (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) circumstances are now
unembarrassed—he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) suffers from no evil of that kind; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) thinks only
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) has married a woman of a less amiable temper than yourself. But
does it follow that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) married you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been happy?—The
inconveniences would have been different. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would then have suffered
under the pecuniary distresses which, because they are removed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) now
reckons as nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have had a wife of whose temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) could
make no complaint, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) would have been always necessitous—always
poor; and probably would soon have learned to rank the innumerable
comforts of a clear estate and good income as of far more importance,
even to domestic happiness, than the mere temper of a wife."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have not a doubt of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne/Miss Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne; "and I have nothing to
regret—nothing but my own folly."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Rather say your mother’s imprudence, my child,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood;
"_she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)_ must be answerable."

<p/>Marianne would not let her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) proceed;—and Elinor, satisfied that each
felt their own error, wished to avoid any survey of the past that might
weaken her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister’s spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), therefore, pursuing the first
subject, immediately continued,

<p/>"_One_ observation may, I think, be fairly drawn from the whole of the
story—that all Willoughby’s difficulties have arisen from the first
offence against virtue, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) behaviour to Eliza Williams. That crime
has been the origin of every lesser one, and of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) present
discontents."

<p/>Marianne assented most feelingly to the remark; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was led
by it to an enumeration of Colonel Brandon’s injuries and merits, warm
as friendship and design could unitedly dictate. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter did not
look, however, as if much of it were heard by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>).

<p/>Elinor, according to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expectation, saw on the two or three following
days, that Marianne did not continue to gain strength as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had done;
but while her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) resolution was unsubdued, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) still tried to appear
cheerful and easy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister could safely trust to the effect of time
upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) health.

<p/>Margaret returned, and the family were again all restored to each
other, again quietly settled at the cottage; and if not pursuing their
usual studies with quite so much vigour as when they first came to
Barton, at least planning a vigorous prosecution of them in future.

<p/>Elinor grew impatient for some tidings of Edward. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had heard nothing
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) leaving London, nothing new of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) plans, nothing
certain even of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) present abode. Some letters had passed between her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) brother, in consequence of Marianne’s illness; and in the first
of John’s, there had been this sentence:—<div class="bookquote">"We know nothing of our
unfortunate Edward, and can make no enquiries on so prohibited a
subject, but conclude him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) to be still at Oxford;"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>which was all the
intelligence of Edward afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) by the correspondence, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) name
was not even mentioned in any of the succeeding letters. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was not
doomed, however, to be long in ignorance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) measures.

<p/>Their man-servant had been sent one morning to Exeter on business; and
when, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) waited at table, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had satisfied the inquiries of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
mistress as to the event of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) errand, this was his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) voluntary
communication,—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suppose you know, ma’am, that Mr. Ferrars is married."

 (<font color='red'><b>mistress</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne gave a violent start, fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes upon Elinor, saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
turning pale, and fell back in her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) chair in hysterics. Mrs. Dashwood,
whose eyes, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) answered the servant’s inquiry, had intuitively
taken the same direction, was shocked to perceive by Elinor’s
countenance how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really suffered, and a moment afterwards,
alike distressed by Marianne’s situation, knew not on which child to
bestow her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) principal attention.

<p/>The servant, who saw only that Miss Marianne was taken ill, had sense
enough to call one of the maids, who, with Mrs. Dashwood’s assistance,
supported her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) into the other room. By that time, Marianne was rather
better, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to the care of Margaret and the
maid, returned to Elinor, who, though still much disordered, had so far
recovered the use of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) reason and voice as to be just beginning an
inquiry of Thomas, as to the source of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) intelligence. Mrs. Dashwood
immediately took all that trouble on herself; and Elinor had the
benefit of the information without the exertion of seeking it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Who told you that Mr. Ferrars was married, Thomas?"

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I see Mr. Ferrars myself, ma’am, this morning in Exeter, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) lady
too, Miss Steele as was. They was stopping in a chaise at the door of
the New London Inn, as I went there with a message from Sally at the
Park to her (<font color='blue'><b>Sally</b></font>) brother, who is one of the post-boys. I happened to look up
as I went by the chaise, and so I see directly it was the youngest Miss
Steele; so I took off my hat, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Steele</b></font>) knew me and called to me, and
inquired after you, ma’am, and the young ladies, especially Miss
Marianne, and bid me I should give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) compliments and Mr. Ferrars’s,
their best compliments and service, and how sorry they was they had not
time to come on and see you, but they was in a great hurry to go
forwards, for they was going further down for a little while, but
howsever, when they come back, they’d make sure to come and see you."

<p/>"But did she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) tell you she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was married, Thomas?"

<p/>"Yes, ma’am. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) smiled, and said how she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had changed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) name since
she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was in these parts. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was always a very affable and free-spoken
young lady, and very civil behaved. So, I made free to wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) joy."

<p/>"Was Mr. Ferrars in the carriage with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Yes, ma’am, I just see him (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) leaning back in it, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) did not look
up;—he (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) never was a gentleman much for talking.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor’s heart could easily account for his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) not putting himself
forward; and Mrs. Dashwood probably found the same explanation.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Was there no one else in the carriage?"

<p/>"No, ma’am, only they two."

<p/>"Do you know where they came from?"

<p/>"They come straight from town, as Miss Lucy—Mrs. Ferrars told me."

<p/>"And are they going farther westward?"

<p/>"Yes, ma’am—but not to bide long. They will soon be back again, and
then they’d be sure and call here."

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood now looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter; but Elinor knew better than
to expect them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) recognised the whole of Lucy in the message, and
was very confident that Edward would never come near them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) observed
in a low voice, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mother, that they were probably going down to
Mr. Pratt’s, near Plymouth.

<p/>Thomas’s intelligence seemed over. Elinor looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) wished to
hear more.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Did you see them off, before you came away?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"No, ma’am—the horses were just coming out, but I could not bide any
longer; I was afraid of being late."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Did Mrs. Ferrars look well?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, ma’am, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) said how she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was very well; and to my mind she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
always a very handsome young lady—and she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) seemed vastly contented."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Dashwood could think of no other question, and Thomas and the
tablecloth, now alike needless, were soon afterwards dismissed.
Marianne had already sent to say, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) should eat nothing more.
Mrs. Dashwood’s and Elinor’s appetites were equally lost, and Margaret
might think herself very well off, that with so much uneasiness as both
her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) sisters had lately experienced, so much reason as they had often
had to be careless of their meals, she (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) had never been obliged to go
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) dinner before.

<p/>When the dessert and the wine were arranged, and Mrs. Dashwood and
Elinor were left by themselves, they remained long together in a
similarity of thoughtfulness and silence. Mrs. Dashwood feared to
hazard any remark, and ventured not to offer consolation. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) now found
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) had erred in relying on Elinor’s representation of herself;
and justly concluded that every thing had been expressly softened at
the time, to spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from an increase of unhappiness, suffering as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) then had suffered for Marianne. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been misled
by the careful, the considerate attention of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) daughter, to think the
attachment, which once she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had so well understood, much slighter in
reality, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been wont to believe, or than it was now proved
to be. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feared that under this persuasion she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had been unjust,
inattentive, nay, almost unkind, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) Elinor;—that Marianne’s
affliction, because more acknowledged, more immediately before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), had
too much engrossed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) tenderness, and led her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) away to forget that in
Elinor she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) might have a daughter suffering almost as much, certainly
with less self-provocation, and greater fortitude.
