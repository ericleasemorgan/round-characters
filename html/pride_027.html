<p/>With no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and
otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton,
sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass
away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not at
first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
soon found, was depending on the plan and she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) gradually learned
to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater
certainty. Absence had increased her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) desire of seeing Charlotte
again, and weakened her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty
in the scheme, and as, with such a mother and such
uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little
change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would
moreover give her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew
near, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would have been very sorry for any delay. Everything,
however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to
Charlotte’s first sketch. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) was to accompany Sir William and
his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in
London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan
could be.

<p/>The only pain was in leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) father, who would certainly miss
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
going, that he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) told her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to write to him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>), and almost promised to
answer her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) letter.

<p/>The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly
friendly; on his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) side even more. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) present pursuit could not
make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and
to deserve his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) attention, the first to listen and to pity, the
first to be admired; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) manner of bidding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) adieu,
wishing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) every enjoyment, reminding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was to
expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)—their opinion of everybody—would always coincide, there was a
solicitude, an interest which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt must ever attach her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) with a most sincere regard; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) parted from him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) convinced
that, whether married or single, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) must always be her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) model of
the amiable and pleasing.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
think him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) less agreeable. Sir William Lucas, and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) daughter
Maria, a good-humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had
nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to
with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth
loved absurdities, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had known Sir William’s too long. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
could tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nothing new of the wonders of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) presentation and
knighthood; and his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) civilities were worn out, like his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
information.

<p/>It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so
early as to be in Gracechurch Street by noon. As they drove to
Mr. Gardiner’s door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching
their arrival; when they entered the passage she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was there to
welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, was
pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs
were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their
cousin’s appearance would not allow them to wait in the
drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for a
twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and
kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in
bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.

<p/>Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) aunt. Their first object
was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was more grieved than astonished to hear,
in reply to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) minute enquiries, that though Jane always
struggled to support her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) spirits, there were periods of
dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would
not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) the particulars also of
Miss Bingley’s visit in Gracechurch Street, and repeated
conversations occurring at different times between Jane and
herself, which proved that the former had, from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart, given
up the acquaintance.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner then rallied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece on Wickham’s desertion, and
complimented her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) on bearing it so well.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But my dear Elizabeth,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added, "what sort of girl is Miss
King? I should be sorry to think our friend mercenary."

<p/>"Pray, my dear aunt, what is the difference in matrimonial
affairs, between the mercenary and the prudent motive? Where does
discretion end, and avarice begin? Last Christmas you were afraid
of his (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) marrying me, because it would be imprudent; and now,
because he (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds,
you want to find out that he (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) is mercenary."

<p/>"If you will only tell me what sort of girl Miss King is, I shall
know what to think."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is a very good kind of girl, I believe. I know no harm of
her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)."

<p/>"But he (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) not the smallest attention till her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>)
grandfather’s death made her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) mistress of this fortune."

<p/>"No—why should he (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>)? If it were not allowable for him (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) to gain _my_
affections because I had no money, what occasion could there be
for making love to a girl whom he (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) did not care about, and who was
equally poor?"

<p/>"But there seems an indelicacy in directing his (<font color='blue'><b>mercenary</b></font>) attentions
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) so soon after this event."

<p/>"A man in distressed circumstances has not time for all those
elegant decorums which other people may observe. If _she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ does
not object to it, why should _we_?"

<p/>"_Her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)_ not objecting does not justify _him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_. It only shows her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)
being deficient in something herself—sense or feeling."

<p/>"Well,<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>have it as you choose. _He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ shall be
mercenary, and _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ shall be foolish."

<p/>"No, Lizzy, that is what I do _not_ choose. I should be sorry,
you know, to think ill of a young man who has lived so long in
Derbyshire."

<p/>"Oh! if that is all, I have a very poor opinion of young men who
live in Derbyshire; and their intimate friends who live in
Hertfordshire are not much better. I am sick of them all. Thank
Heaven! I am going to-morrow where I shall find a man who has not
one agreeable quality, who has neither manner nor sense to
recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). Stupid men are the only ones worth knowing, after
all."

<p/>"Take care, Lizzy; that speech savours strongly of
disappointment.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Before they were separated by the conclusion of the play, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) had
the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) uncle
and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the
summer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Gardiner</b></font>)</div>We have not determined how far it shall carry us," said Mrs.
Gardiner, "but, perhaps, to the Lakes.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>No scheme could have been more agreeable to Elizabeth, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh, my
dear, dear aunt," she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) rapturously cried, "what delight! what
felicity! You give me fresh life and vigour. Adieu to
disappointment and spleen. What are young men to rocks and
mountains? Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when
we _do_ return, it shall not be like other travellers, without
being able to give one accurate idea of anything. We _will_ know
where we have gone—we _will_ recollect what we have seen. Lakes,
mountains, and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our
imaginations; nor when we attempt to describe any particular
scene, will we begin quarreling about its relative situation. Let
_our_ first effusions be less insupportable than those of the
generality of travellers."
