<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was surprised only for a moment at seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); for his (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
coming to Barton was, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) opinion, of all things the most natural.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) joy and expression of regard long outlived her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wonder. He (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) received
the kindest welcome from her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and shyness, coldness, reserve could not
stand against such a reception. They had begun to fail him (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
entered the house, and they were quite overcome by the captivating
manners of Mrs. Dashwood. Indeed a man could not very well be in love
with either of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughters, without extending the passion to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>); and
Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) soon become more like
himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) affections seemed to reanimate towards them all, and his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
interest in their welfare again became perceptible. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in
spirits, however; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) praised their house, admired its prospect, was
attentive, and kind; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not in spirits. The whole family
perceived it, and Mrs. Dashwood, attributing it to some want of
liberality in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) mother, sat down to table indignant against all
selfish parents.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What are Mrs. Ferrars’s views for you at present, Edward?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>),
when dinner was over and they had drawn round the fire; <div class="bookquote">"are you still
to be a great orator in spite of yourself?"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"No. I hope my mother is now convinced that I have no more talents than
inclination for a public life!"

<p/>"But how is your fame to be established? for famous you must be to
satisfy all your family; and with no inclination for expense, no
affection for strangers, no profession, and no assurance, you may find
it a difficult matter."

<p/>"I shall not attempt it. I have no wish to be distinguished; and have
every reason to hope I never shall. Thank Heaven! I cannot be forced
into genius and eloquence."

<p/>"You have no ambition, I well know. Your wishes are all moderate."

<p/>"As moderate as those of the rest of the world, I believe. I wish as
well as every body else to be perfectly happy; but, like every body
else it must be in my own way. Greatness will not make me so."

<p/>"Strange that it would!<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>What have wealth or grandeur
to do with happiness?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Grandeur has but little,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "but wealth has much to do with
it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Elinor, for shame!"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "money can only give happiness
where there is nothing else to give it. Beyond a competence, it can
afford no real satisfaction, as far as mere self is concerned."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, smiling, "we may come to the same point. _Your_
competence and _my_ wealth are very much alike, I dare say; and without
them, as the world goes now, we shall both agree that every kind of
external comfort must be wanting. Your ideas are only more noble than
mine. Come, what is your competence?"

<p/>"About eighteen hundred or two thousand a year; not more than _that_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor laughed. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>_two_ thousand a year! _one_ is my wealth! I guessed
how it would end."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And yet two thousand a-year is a very moderate income,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne.
"A family cannot well be maintained on a smaller. I am sure I am not
extravagant in my demands. A proper establishment of servants, a
carriage, perhaps two, and hunters, cannot be supported on less.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor smiled again, to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister describing so accurately their
future expenses at Combe Magna.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Hunters</b></font>)</div>Hunters!" repeated Edward—"but why must you have hunters? Every body
does not hunt."

<p/>Marianne coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) replied, "But most people do."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I wish,"  (<font color='red'><b>Margaret</b></font>)</div>said Margaret, striking out a novel thought, "that somebody
would give us all a large fortune apiece!"

<p/>"Oh that they would!<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes sparkling with
animation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cheeks glowing with the delight of such imaginary
happiness.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose," said Elinor, "in spite
of the insufficiency of wealth."

<p/>"Oh dear!" cried Margaret, "how happy I should be! I wonder what I
should do with it!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had no doubt on that point.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I should be puzzled to spend so large a fortune myself," said Mrs.
Dashwood, "if my children were all to be rich without my help."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You must begin your improvements on this house,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>observed Elinor, "and
your difficulties will soon vanish."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What magnificent orders would travel from this family to London,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>said
Edward, "in such an event! What a happy day for booksellers,
music-sellers, and print-shops! You, Miss Dashwood, would give a
general commission for every new print of merit to be sent you—and as
for Marianne, I know her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) greatness of soul, there would not be music
enough in London to content her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). And books!—Thomson, Cowper, Scott—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
would buy them all over and over again: she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would buy up every copy, I
believe, to prevent their falling into unworthy hands; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would
have every book that tells her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) how to admire an old twisted tree.
Should not you, Marianne? Forgive me, if I am very saucy. But I was
willing to show you that I had not forgot our old disputes."

<p/>"I love to be reminded of the past, Edward—whether it be melancholy or
gay, I love to recall it—and you will never offend me by talking of
former times. You are very right in supposing how my money would be
spent—some of it, at least—my loose cash would certainly be employed in
improving my collection of music and books."

<p/>"And the bulk of your fortune would be laid out in annuities on the
authors or their heirs."

<p/>"No, Edward, I should have something else to do with it."

<p/>"Perhaps, then, you would bestow it as a reward on that person who
wrote the ablest defence of your favourite maxim, that no one can ever
be in love more than once in their life—your opinion on that point is
unchanged, I presume?"

<p/>"Undoubtedly. At my time of life opinions are tolerably fixed. It is
not likely that I should now see or hear any thing to change them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is not
at all altered."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is only grown a little more grave than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nay, Edward,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "_you_ need not reproach me. You are not
very gay yourself."

<p/>"Why should you think so!<div class="bookquote">" replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), with a sigh. " (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>But gaiety never
was a part of _my_ character."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nor do I think it a part of Marianne’s,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said Elinor; "I should hardly
call her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) a lively girl—she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is very earnest, very eager in all she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
does—sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation—but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) is
not often really merry."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I believe you are right,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) replied, "and yet I have always set her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
down as a lively girl."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor, "in a total misapprehension of character in some point or
other: fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or
stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the
deception originated. Sometimes one is guided by what they say of
themselves, and very frequently by what other people say of them,
without giving oneself time to deliberate and judge."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But I thought it was right, Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "to be guided
wholly by the opinion of other people. I thought our judgments were
given us merely to be subservient to those of neighbours. This has
always been your doctrine, I am sure."

<p/>"No, Marianne, never. My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of
the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the
behaviour. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of
having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with
greater attention; but when have I advised you to adopt their
sentiments or to conform to their judgment in serious matters?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have not been able to bring your sister over to your plan of
general civility,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edward</b></font>)</div>said Edward to Elinor, "Do you gain no ground?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Quite the contrary,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.

<p/>"My judgment," he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) returned, "is all on your side of the question; but I
am afraid my practice is much more on your sister’s. I never wish to
offend, but I am so foolishly shy, that I often seem negligent, when I
am only kept back by my natural awkwardness. I have frequently thought
that I must have been intended by nature to be fond of low company, I
am so little at my ease among strangers of gentility!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) knows her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own worth too well for false shame," replied Edward.
"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or
other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy
and graceful, I should not be shy."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But you would still be reserved,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "and that is worse."

<p/>Edward started—"Reserved! Am I reserved, Marianne?"

<p/>"Yes, very."

<p/>"I do not understand you,<div class="bookquote">" replied he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), colouring. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Reserved!—how, in
what manner? What am I to tell you? What can you suppose?"

<p/>Elinor looked surprised at his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) emotion; but trying to laugh off the
subject, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) said to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), "Do not you know my sister well enough to
understand what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) means? Do not you know she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) calls every one reserved
who does not talk as fast, and admire what she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) admires as rapturously
as herself?"

<p/>Edward made no answer. His (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) gravity and thoughtfulness returned on him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
in their fullest extent—and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sat for some time silent and dull.
