<p/>The Dashwoods were now settled at Barton with tolerable comfort to
themselves. The house and the garden, with all the objects surrounding
them, were now become familiar, and the ordinary pursuits which had
given to Norland half its charms were engaged in again with far greater
enjoyment than Norland had been able to afford, since the loss of their
father. Sir John Middleton, who called on them every day for the first
fortnight, and who was not in the habit of seeing much occupation at
home, could not conceal his (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) amazement on finding them always employed.

<p/>Their visitors, except those from Barton Park, were not many; for, in
spite of Sir John’s urgent entreaties that they would mix more in the
neighbourhood, and repeated assurances of his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) carriage being always at
their service, the independence of Mrs. Dashwood’s spirit overcame the
wish of society for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) children; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was resolute in declining to
visit any family beyond the distance of a walk. There were but few who
could be so classed; and it was not all of them that were attainable.
About a mile and a half from the cottage, along the narrow winding
valley of Allenham, which issued from that of Barton, as formerly
described, the girls had, in one of their earliest walks, discovered an
ancient respectable looking mansion which, by reminding them a little
of Norland, interested their imagination and made them wish to be
better acquainted with it. But they learnt, on enquiry, that its
possessor, an elderly lady of very good character, was unfortunately
too infirm to mix with the world, and never stirred from home.

<p/>The whole country about them abounded in beautiful walks. The high
downs which invited them from almost every window of the cottage to
seek the exquisite enjoyment of air on their summits, were a happy
alternative when the dirt of the valleys beneath shut up their superior
beauties; and towards one of these hills did Marianne and Margaret one
memorable morning direct their steps, attracted by the partial sunshine
of a showery sky, and unable longer to bear the confinement which the
settled rain of the two preceding days had occasioned. The weather was
not tempting enough to draw the two others from their pencil and their
book, in spite of Marianne’s declaration that the day would be
lastingly fair, and that every threatening cloud would be drawn off
from their hills; and the two girls set off together.

<p/>They gaily ascended the downs, rejoicing in their own penetration at
every glimpse of blue sky; and when they caught in their faces the
animating gales of a high south-westerly wind, they pitied the fears
which had prevented their mother and Elinor from sharing such
delightful sensations.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Is there a felicity in the world,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, "superior to
this?—Margaret, we will walk here at least two hours."

<p/>Margaret agreed, and they pursued their way against the wind, resisting
it with laughing delight for about twenty minutes longer, when suddenly
the clouds united over their heads, and a driving rain set full in
their face. Chagrined and surprised, they were obliged, though
unwillingly, to turn back, for no shelter was nearer than their own
house. One consolation however remained for them, to which the exigence
of the moment gave more than usual propriety,—it was that of running
with all possible speed down the steep side of the hill which led
immediately to their garden gate.

<p/>They set off. Marianne had at first the advantage, but a false step
brought her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) suddenly to the ground; and Margaret, unable to stop
herself to assist her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>), was involuntarily hurried along, and reached the
bottom in safety.

<p/>A gentleman carrying a gun, with two pointers playing round him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>), was
passing up the hill and within a few yards of Marianne, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
accident happened. He (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) put down his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gun and ran to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) assistance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
had raised herself from the ground, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) foot had been twisted in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fall, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was scarcely able to stand. The gentleman offered his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>)
services; and perceiving that her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) modesty declined what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) situation
rendered necessary, took her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) up in his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) arms without farther delay, and
carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) down the hill. Then passing through the garden, the gate of
which had been left open by Margaret, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) bore her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) directly into the
house, whither Margaret was just arrived, and quitted not his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hold till
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had seated her (<font color='blue'><b>Margaret</b></font>) in a chair in the parlour.

<p/>Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother rose up in amazement at their entrance, and while
the eyes of both were fixed on him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) with an evident wonder and a secret
admiration which equally sprung from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) appearance, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) apologized for
his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) intrusion by relating its cause, in a manner so frank and so
graceful that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person, which was uncommonly handsome, received
additional charms from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) voice and expression. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) been even old,
ugly, and vulgar, the gratitude and kindness of Mrs. Dashwood would
have been secured by any act of attention to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) child; but the
influence of youth, beauty, and elegance, gave an interest to the
action which came home to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) feelings.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) again and again; and, with a sweetness of address which
always attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), invited him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to be seated. But this he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) declined, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was dirty and wet. Mrs. Dashwood then begged to know to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) was
obliged. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) name, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) replied, was Willoughby, and his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) present home was
at Allenham, from whence he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) would allow him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) the honour of
calling tomorrow to enquire after Miss Dashwood. The honour was readily
granted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) then departed, to make himself still more interesting,
in the midst of a heavy rain.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) manly beauty and more than common gracefulness were instantly the
theme of general admiration, and the laugh which his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) gallantry raised
against Marianne received particular spirit from his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) exterior
attractions. Marianne herself had seen less of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person than the
rest, for the confusion which crimsoned over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) face, on his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) lifting
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) up, had robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) of the power of regarding him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) after their
entering the house. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had seen enough of him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) to join in all the
admiration of the others, and with an energy which always adorned her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
praise. His (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) person and air were equal to what her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) fancy had ever drawn
for the hero of a favourite story; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) carrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) into the
house with so little previous formality, there was a rapidity of
thought which particularly recommended the action to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>). Every
circumstance belonging to him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) was interesting. His (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) name was good, his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>)
residence was in their favourite village, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) soon found out that
of all manly dresses a shooting-jacket was the most becoming. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
imagination was busy, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) reflections were pleasant, and the pain of a
sprained ankle was disregarded.

<p/>Sir John called on them as soon as the next interval of fair weather
that morning allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to get out of doors; and Marianne’s accident
being related to him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was eagerly asked whether he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) knew any
gentleman of the name of Willoughby at Allenham.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Willoughby!"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>cried Sir John; "what, is _he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)_ in the country? That is
good news however; I will ride over tomorrow, and ask him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) to dinner on
Thursday."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You know him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) then,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood.

<p/>"Know him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)! to be sure I do. Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is down here every year."

<p/>"And what sort of a young man is he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?"

<p/>"As good a kind of fellow as ever lived, I assure you. A very decent
shot, and there is not a bolder rider in England."

<p/>"And is _that_ all you can say for him (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)?<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne, indignantly.
" (<font color='red'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)</div>But what are his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) manners on more intimate acquaintance? What his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>)
pursuits, his (<font color='blue'><b>rider</b></font>) talents, and genius?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sir John was rather puzzled.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Upon my soul," said he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>), "I do not know much about him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as to all
_that_. But he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) is a pleasant, good humoured fellow, and has got the
nicest little black bitch of a pointer I ever saw. Was she (<font color='blue'><b>bitch</b></font>) out with him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
today?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But Marianne could no more satisfy him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) as to the colour of Mr.
Willoughby’s pointer, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could describe to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) the shades of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
mind.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>But who is he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?" said Elinor. "Where does he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) come from? Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) a house
at Allenham?"

<p/>On this point Sir John could give more certain intelligence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
told them that Mr. Willoughby had no property of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own in the
country; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) resided there only while he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was visiting the old lady
at Allenham Court, to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was related, and whose possessions he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
to inherit; adding, "Yes, yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is very well worth catching I can
tell you, Miss Dashwood; he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has a pretty little estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own in
Somersetshire besides; and if I were you, I would not give him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) up to my
younger sister, in spite of all this tumbling down hills. Miss Marianne
must not expect to have all the men to herself. Brandon will be
jealous, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) does not take care."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not believe,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Dashwood, with a good humoured smile,
"that Mr. Willoughby will be incommoded by the attempts of either of
_my_ daughters towards what you call _catching him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)_. It is not an
employment to which they have been brought up. Men are very safe with
us, let them be ever so rich. I am glad to find, however, from what you
say, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is a respectable young man, and one whose acquaintance
will not be ineligible."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is as good a sort of fellow, I believe, as ever lived,<div class="bookquote">" repeated
Sir John. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remember last Christmas at a little hop at the park, he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>)
danced from eight o’clock till four, without once sitting down."

<p/>"Did he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) indeed?<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne with sparkling eyes, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and with
elegance, with spirit?"

<p/>"Yes; and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) was up again at eight to ride to covert."

<p/>"That is what I like; that is what a young man ought to be. Whatever be
his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) pursuits, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) eagerness in them should know no moderation, and
leave him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) no sense of fatigue."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Aye, aye, I see how it will be,"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said Sir John, "I see how it will be.
You will be setting your cap at him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) now, and never think of poor
Brandon."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is an expression, Sir John,"  (<font color='red'><b>Marianne</b></font>)</div>said Marianne, warmly, "which I
particularly dislike. I abhor every common-place phrase by which wit is
intended; and <div class="bookquote">‘setting one’s cap at a man,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>or <div class="bookquote">‘making a conquest,’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>are
the most odious of all. Their tendency is gross and illiberal; and if
their construction could ever be deemed clever, time has long ago
destroyed all its ingenuity."

<p/>Sir John did not much understand this reproof; but he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) laughed as
heartily as if he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) did, and then replied,

<p/>"Ay, you will make conquests enough, I dare say, one way or other. Poor
Brandon! he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is quite smitten already, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) is very well worth setting
your cap at, I can tell you, in spite of all this tumbling about and
spraining of ankles."
