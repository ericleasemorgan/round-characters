<p/>Fanny’s rides recommenced the very next day; and as it was a pleasant
fresh-feeling morning, less hot than the weather had lately been,
Edmund trusted that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) losses, both of health and pleasure, would be
soon made good. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was gone Mr. Rushworth arrived, escorting his (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>)
mother, who came to be civil and to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) civility especially, in
urging the execution of the plan for visiting Sotherton, which had been
started a fortnight before, and which, in consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>) subsequent
absence from home, had since lain dormant. Mrs. Norris and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) nieces
were all well pleased with its revival, and an early day was named and
agreed to, provided Mr. Crawford should be disengaged: the young ladies
did not forget that stipulation, and though Mrs. Norris would willingly
have answered for his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) being so, they would neither authorise the
liberty nor run the risk; and at last, on a hint from Miss Bertram, Mr.
Rushworth discovered that the properest thing to be done was for him (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) to
walk down to the Parsonage directly, and call on Mr. Crawford, and
inquire whether Wednesday would suit him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) or not.

<p/>Before his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) return Mrs. Grant and Miss Crawford came in. Having been out
some time, and taken a different route to the house, they had not met
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Comfortable hopes, however, were given that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would find Mr.
Crawford at home. The Sotherton scheme was mentioned of course. It was
hardly possible, indeed, that anything else should be talked of, for
Mrs. Norris was in high spirits about it; and Mrs. Rushworth, a
well-meaning, civil, prosing, pompous woman, who thought nothing of
consequence, but as it related to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) own and her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) son’s concerns, had
not yet given over pressing Lady Bertram to be of the party. Lady
Bertram constantly declined it; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) placid manner of refusal made
Mrs. Rushworth still think she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) wished to come, till Mrs. Norris’s more
numerous words and louder tone convinced her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) of the truth.

<p/>"The fatigue would be too much for my sister, a great deal too much, I
assure you, my dear Mrs. Rushworth. Ten miles there, and ten back, you
know. You must excuse my sister on this occasion, and accept of our two
dear girls and myself without her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Sotherton is the only place that
could give her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) a _wish_ to go so far, but it cannot be, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
will have a companion in Fanny Price, you know, so it will all do very
well; and as for Edmund, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is not here to speak for himself, I will
answer for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) being most happy to join the party. He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) can go on
horseback, you know.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth being obliged to yield to Lady Bertram’s staying at
home, could only be sorry. " (<font color='red'><b>ladyship</b></font>)</div>The loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) ladyship’s company would be
a great drawback, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) should have been extremely happy to have seen
the young lady too, Miss Price, who had never been at Sotherton yet,
and it was a pity she (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) should not see the place."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are very kind, you are all kindness, my dear madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs.
Norris; "but as to Fanny, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) will have opportunities in plenty of
seeing Sotherton. She (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>) has time enough before her (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>); and her (<font color='blue'><b>Sotherton</b></font>) going now is
quite out of the question. Lady Bertram could not possibly spare her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)."

<p/>"Oh no! I cannot do without Fanny."

<p/>Mrs. Rushworth proceeded next, under the conviction that everybody must
be wanting to see Sotherton, to include Miss Crawford in the
invitation; and though Mrs. Grant, who had not been at the trouble of
visiting Mrs. Rushworth, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) coming into the neighbourhood, civilly
declined it on her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) was glad to secure any pleasure for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) sister; and Mary, properly pressed and persuaded, was not long in
accepting her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) share of the civility. Mr. Rushworth came back from the
Parsonage successful; and Edmund made his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) appearance just in time to
learn what had been settled for Wednesday, to attend Mrs. Rushworth to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) carriage, and walk half-way down the park with the two other
ladies.

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) return to the breakfast-room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found Mrs. Norris trying to
make up her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) mind as to whether Miss Crawford’s being of the party were
desirable or not, or whether her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) brother’s barouche would not be full
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). The Miss Bertrams laughed at the idea, assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertrams</b></font>) that
the barouche would hold four perfectly well, independent of the box, on
which _one_ might go with him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But why is it necessary,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, "that Crawford’s carriage, or
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) _only_, should be employed? Why is no use to be made of my mother’s
chaise? I could not, when the scheme was first mentioned the other day,
understand why a visit from the family were not to be made in the
carriage of the family."

<p/>"What!" cried Julia: "go boxed up three in a postchaise in this
weather, when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that
will not quite do."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Besides,"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, "I know that Mr. Crawford depends upon taking
us. After what passed at first, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would claim it as a promise."

<p/>"And, my dear Edmund," added Mrs. Norris, "taking out _two_ carriages
when _one_ will do, would be trouble for nothing; and, between
ourselves, coachman is not very fond of the roads between this and
Sotherton: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) always complains bitterly of the narrow lanes scratching
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) carriage, and you know one should not like to have dear Sir Thomas,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) comes home, find all the varnish scratched off."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That would not be a very handsome reason for using Mr. Crawford’s,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria; "but the truth is, that Wilcox is a stupid old fellow, and
does not know how to drive. I will answer for it that we shall find no
inconvenience from narrow roads on Wednesday."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There is no hardship, I suppose, nothing unpleasant,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, "in
going on the barouche box."

<p/>"Unpleasant!" cried Maria: "oh dear! I believe it would be generally
thought the favourite seat. There can be no comparison as to one’s view
of the country. Probably Miss Crawford will choose the barouche-box
herself."

<p/>"There can be no objection, then, to Fanny’s going with you; there can
be no doubt of your having room for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>"Fanny!" repeated Mrs. Norris; "my dear Edmund, there is no idea of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
going with us. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) stays with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt. I told Mrs. Rushworth so. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
is not expected."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You can have no reason, I imagine, madam,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
mother, "for wishing Fanny _not_ to be of the party, but as it relates
to yourself, to your own comfort. If you could do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), you
would not wish to keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) at home?"

<p/>"To be sure not, but I _cannot_ do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)."

<p/>"You can, if I stay at home with you, as I mean to do.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>There was a general cry out at this. " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Yes," he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) continued, "there is no
necessity for my going, and I mean to stay at home. Fanny has a great
desire to see Sotherton. I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishes it very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) has not
often a gratification of the kind, and I am sure, ma’am, you would be
glad to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the pleasure now?"

<p/>"Oh yes! very glad, if your aunt sees no objection."

<p/>Mrs. Norris was very ready with the only objection which could
remain—their having positively assured Mrs. Rushworth that Fanny could
not go, and the very strange appearance there would consequently be in
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a difficulty quite impossible to be got
over. It must have the strangest appearance! It would be something so
very unceremonious, so bordering on disrespect for Mrs. Rushworth,
whose own manners were such a pattern of good-breeding and attention,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) really did not feel equal to it. Mrs. Norris had no affection
for Fanny, and no wish of procuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure at any time; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
opposition to Edmund _now_, arose more from partiality for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own
scheme, because it _was_ her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own, than from anything else. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had arranged everything extremely well, and that any
alteration must be for the worse. When Edmund, therefore, told her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in
reply, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) did when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the hearing, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) need not
distress herself on Mrs. Rushworth’s account, because he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had taken the
opportunity, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) walked with her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) through the hall, of mentioning Miss
Price as one who would probably be of the party, and had directly
received a very sufficient invitation for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) cousin, Mrs. Norris was
too much vexed to submit with a very good grace, and would only say,
<div class="bookquote">"Very well, very well, just as you chuse, settle it your own way, I am
sure I do not care about it."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Norris</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"It seems very odd,"  (<font color='red'><b>Maria</b></font>)</div>said Maria, "that you should be staying at home
instead of Fanny."

<p/>"I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to be very much obliged to you," added Julia,
hastily leaving the room as she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) spoke, from a consciousness that she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>)
ought to offer to stay at home herself.

<p/>"Fanny will feel quite as grateful as the occasion requires,<div class="bookquote">" was
Edmund’s only reply, and the subject dropt.

<p/>Fanny’s gratitude, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heard the plan, was, in fact, much greater
than her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt Edmund’s kindness with all, and more than
all, the sensibility which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), unsuspicious of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fond attachment,
could be aware of; but that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) should forego any enjoyment on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
account gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) pain, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own satisfaction in seeing Sotherton
would be nothing without him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).

<p/>The next meeting of the two Mansfield families produced another
alteration in the plan, and one that was admitted with general
approbation. Mrs. Grant offered herself as companion for the day to
Lady Bertram in lieu of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) son, and Dr. Grant was to join them at
dinner. Lady Bertram was very well pleased to have it so, and the young
ladies were in spirits again. Even Edmund was very thankful for an
arrangement which restored him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) share of the party; and Mrs.
Norris thought it an excellent plan, and had it at her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) tongue’s end,
and was on the point of proposing it, when Mrs. Grant spoke.

<p/>Wednesday was fine, and soon after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr.
Crawford driving his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sisters; and as everybody was ready, there was
nothing to be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take
their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of
honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While
each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most
appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled
by Mrs. Grant’s saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) stepped from the carriage, " (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>As there are
five of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as
you were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I think
this will be a good opportunity for you to take a lesson."

<p/>Happy Julia! Unhappy Maria! The former was on the barouche-box in a
moment, the latter took her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) seat within, in gloom and mortification;
and the carriage drove off amid the good wishes of the two remaining
ladies, and the barking of Pug in his (<font color='blue'><b>Pug</b></font>) mistress’s arms.

<p/>Their road was through a pleasant country; and Fanny, whose rides had
never been extensive, was soon beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) knowledge, and was very happy
in observing all that was new, and admiring all that was pretty. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was not often invited to join in the conversation of the others, nor
did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) desire it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own thoughts and reflections were habitually her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
best companions; and, in observing the appearance of the country, the
bearings of the roads, the difference of soil, the state of the
harvest, the cottages, the cattle, the children, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found
entertainment that could only have been heightened by having Edmund to
speak to of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt. That was the only point of resemblance
between her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) and the lady who sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>): in everything but a value for
Edmund, Miss Crawford was very unlike her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had none of Fanny’s
delicacy of taste, of mind, of feeling; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) saw Nature, inanimate
Nature, with little observation; her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attention was all for men and
women, her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) talents for the light and lively. In looking back after
Edmund, however, when there was any stretch of road behind them, or
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gained on them in ascending a considerable hill, they were
united, and a "there he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) is" broke at the same moment from them both,
more than once.

<p/>For the first seven miles Miss Bertram had very little real comfort:
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) prospect always ended in Mr. Crawford and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) sister sitting side
by side, full of conversation and merriment; and to see only his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
expressive profile as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned with a smile to Julia, or to catch the
laugh of the other, was a perpetual source of irritation, which her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) own
sense of propriety could but just smooth over. When Julia looked back,
it was with a countenance of delight, and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) spoke to them,
it was in the highest spirits: <div class="bookquote">"her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) view of the country was charming,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) wished they could all see it,"  (<font color='red'><b>the spirits</b></font>)</div>etc.; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Julia</b></font>) only offer of exchange
was addressed to Miss Crawford, as they gained the summit of a long
hill, and was not more inviting than this: <div class="bookquote">"Here is a fine burst of
country. I wish you had my seat, but I dare say you will not take it,
let me press you ever so much;"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>and Miss Crawford could hardly answer
before they were moving again at a good pace.

<p/>When they came within the influence of Sotherton associations, it was
better for Miss Bertram, who might be said to have two strings to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
bow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had Rushworth feelings, and Crawford feelings, and in the
vicinity of Sotherton the former had considerable effect. Mr.
Rushworth’s consequence was hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not tell Miss Crawford that
<div class="bookquote">"those woods belonged to Sotherton,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not carelessly observe
that <div class="bookquote">"she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) believed that it was now all Mr. Rushworth’s property on each
side of the road,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>without elation of heart; and it was a pleasure to
increase with their approach to the capital freehold mansion, and
ancient manorial residence of the family, with all its rights of
court-leet and court-baron.

<p/>"Now we shall have no more rough road, Miss Crawford; our difficulties
are over. The rest of the way is such as it ought to be. Mr. Rushworth
has made it since he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) succeeded to the estate. Here begins the village.
Those cottages are really a disgrace. The church spire is reckoned
remarkably handsome. I am glad the church is not so close to the great
house as often happens in old places. The annoyance of the bells must
be terrible. There is the parsonage: a tidy-looking house, and I
understand the clergyman and his (<font color='blue'><b>clergyman</b></font>) wife are very decent people. Those are
almshouses, built by some of the family. To the right is the steward’s
house; he (<font color='blue'><b>steward</b></font>) is a very respectable man. Now we are coming to the
lodge-gates; but we have nearly a mile through the park still. It is
not ugly, you see, at this end; there is some fine timber, but the
situation of the house is dreadful. We go down hill to it for half a
mile, and it is a pity, for it would not be an ill-looking place if it
had a better approach."

<p/>Miss Crawford was not slow to admire; she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) pretty well guessed Miss
Bertram’s feelings, and made it a point of honour to promote her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
enjoyment to the utmost. Mrs. Norris was all delight and volubility;
and even Fanny had something to say in admiration, and might be heard
with complacency. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye was eagerly taking in everything within her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
reach; and after being at some pains to get a view of the house, and
observing that <div class="bookquote">"it was a sort of building which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not look at
but with respect,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) added, "Now, where is the avenue? The house
fronts the east, I perceive. The avenue, therefore, must be at the back
of it. Mr. Rushworth talked of the west front."

<p/>"Yes, it is exactly behind the house; begins at a little distance, and
ascends for half a mile to the extremity of the grounds. You may see
something of it here—something of the more distant trees. It is oak
entirely."

<p/>Miss Bertram could now speak with decided information of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) had
known nothing about when Mr. Rushworth had asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) opinion; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
spirits were in as happy a flutter as vanity and pride could furnish,
when they drove up to the spacious stone steps before the principal
entrance.
