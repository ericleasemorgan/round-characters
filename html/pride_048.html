<p/>The whole party were in hopes of a letter from Mr. Bennet the
next morning, but the post came in without bringing a single line
from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) family knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to be, on all common occasions, a
most negligent and dilatory correspondent; but at such a time
they had hoped for exertion. They were forced to conclude that he (<font color='blue'><b>correspondent</b></font>)
had no pleasing intelligence to send; but even of _that_ they
would have been glad to be certain. Mr. Gardiner had waited only
for the letters before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) set off.

<p/>When he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) was gone, they were certain at least of receiving
constant information of what was going on, and their uncle
promised, at parting, to prevail on Mr. Bennet to return to
Longbourn, as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could, to the great consolation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
sister, who considered it as the only security for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) husband’s
not being killed in a duel.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner and the children were to remain in Hertfordshire a
few days longer, as the former thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) presence might be
serviceable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) nieces. She (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) shared in their attendance on Mrs.
Bennet, and was a great comfort to them in their hours of
freedom. Their other aunt also visited them frequently, and
always, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) said, with the design of cheering and heartening
them up—though, as she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) never came without reporting some fresh
instance of Wickham’s extravagance or irregularity, she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) seldom
went away without leaving them more dispirited than she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) found
them.

<p/>All Meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who, but three
months before, had been almost an angel of light. He (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) was declared
to be in debt to every tradesman in the place, and his (<font color='blue'><b>angel</b></font>) intrigues,
all honoured with the title of seduction, had been extended into
every tradesman’s family. Everybody declared that he (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) was the
wickedest young man in the world; and everybody began to find out
that they had always distrusted the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>tradesman</b></font>) goodness.
Elizabeth, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not credit above half of what was said,
believed enough to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) former assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister’s ruin
more certain; and even Jane, who believed still less of it,
became almost hopeless, more especially as the time was now come
when, if they had gone to Scotland, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had never before
entirely despaired of, they must in all probability have gained
some news of them.

<p/>Mr. Gardiner left Longbourn on Sunday; on Tuesday his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) wife
received a letter from him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>); it told them that, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) arrival, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>)
had immediately found out his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother, and persuaded him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to come
to Gracechurch Street; that Mr. Bennet had been to Epsom and
Clapham, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) arrival, but without gaining any satisfactory
information; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was now determined to enquire at all the
principal hotels in town, as Mr. Bennet thought it possible they
might have gone to one of them, on their first coming to London,
before they procured lodgings. Mr. Gardiner himself did not
expect any success from this measure, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother was
eager in it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) meant to assist him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) in pursuing it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) added that
Mr. Bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave London
and promised to write again very soon. There was also a
postscript to this effect:

<p/>"I have written to Colonel Forster to desire him (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) to find out, if
possible, from some of the young man’s intimates in the regiment,
whether Wickham has any relations or connections who would be
likely to know in what part of town he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) has now concealed himself.
If there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability
of gaining such a clue as that, it might be of essential
consequence. At present we have nothing to guide us. Colonel
Forster will, I dare say, do everything in his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) power to satisfy
us on this head. But, on second thoughts, perhaps, Lizzy could
tell us what relations he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) has now living, better than any other
person."

<p/>Elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) authority proceeded; but it was not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) power to give
any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment
deserved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had never heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) having had any relations,
except a father and mother, both of whom had been dead many
years. It was possible, however, that some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) companions in
the ——shire might be able to give more information; and though
she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was not very sanguine in expecting it, the application was a
something to look forward to.

<p/>Every day at Longbourn was now a day of anxiety; but the most
anxious part of each was when the post was expected. The arrival
of letters was the grand object of every morning’s impatience.
Through letters, whatever of good or bad was to be told would be
communicated, and every succeeding day was expected to bring some
news of importance.

<p/>But before they heard again from Mr. Gardiner, a letter arrived
for their father, from a different quarter, from Mr. Collins;
which, as Jane had received directions to open all that came for
him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) in his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) absence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) accordingly read; and Elizabeth, who knew
what curiosities his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) letters always were, looked over her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and
read it likewise. It was as follows:

<p/>"My dear Sir,
"I feel myself called upon, by our relationship, and my situation
in life, to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are
now suffering under, of which we were yesterday informed by a
letter from Hertfordshire. Be assured, my dear sir, that Mrs.
Collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your
respectable family, in your present distress, which must be of
the bitterest kind, because proceeding from a cause which no time
can remove. No arguments shall be wanting on my part that can
alleviate so severe a misfortune—or that may comfort you, under a
circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a
parent’s mind. The death of your daughter would have been a
blessing in comparison of this. And it is the more to be
lamented, because there is reason to suppose as my dear Charlotte
informs me, that this licentiousness of behaviour in your
daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence;
though, at the same time, for the consolation of yourself and
Mrs. Bennet, I am inclined to think that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) own disposition must
be naturally bad, or she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not be guilty of such an enormity,
at so early an age. Howsoever that may be, you are grievously to
be pitied; in which opinion I am not only joined by Mrs. Collins,
but likewise by Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, to whom I have
related the affair. They agree with me in apprehending that this
false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of
all the others; for who, as Lady Catherine herself
condescendingly says, will connect themselves with such a family?
And this consideration leads me moreover to reflect, with
augmented satisfaction, on a certain event of last November; for
had it been otherwise, I must have been involved in all your
sorrow and disgrace. Let me then advise you, dear sir, to console
yourself as much as possible, to throw off your unworthy child
from your affection for ever, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to reap the fruits of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own heinous offense.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am, dear sir, etc., etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Gardiner</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Gardiner did not write again till he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had received an answer
from Colonel Forster; and then he (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) had nothing of a pleasant
nature to send. It was not known that Wickham had a single
relationship with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) kept up any connection, and it was
certain that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had no near one living. His (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) former acquaintances
had been numerous; but since he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had been in the militia, it did
not appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was on terms of particular friendship with any
of them. There was no one, therefore, who could be pointed out as
likely to give any news of him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>). And in the wretched state of his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>)
own finances, there was a very powerful motive for secrecy, in
addition to his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) fear of discovery by Lydia’s relations, for it
had just transpired that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) had left gaming debts behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) to a
very considerable amount. Colonel Forster believed that more than
a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) expenses at
Brighton. He (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) owed a good deal in town, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) debts of honour
were still more formidable. Mr. Gardiner did not attempt to
conceal these particulars from the Longbourn family. Jane heard
them with horror. <div class="bookquote">"A gamester!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cried. "This is wholly
unexpected. I had not an idea of it."

<p/>Mr. Gardiner added in his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) letter, that they might expect to see
their father at home on the following day, which was Saturday.
Rendered spiritless by the ill-success of all their endeavours,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) had yielded to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) brother-in-law’s entreaty that he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) would
return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) family, and leave it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) to do whatever occasion
might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit. When
Mrs. Bennet was told of this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did not express so much
satisfaction as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) children expected, considering what her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
anxiety for his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) life had been before.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) coming home, and without poor Lydia?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) cried.
"Sure he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) will not leave London before he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) has found them. Who is
to fight Wickham, and make him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), if he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) comes away?"

<p/>As Mrs. Gardiner began to wish to be at home, it was settled that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) and the children should go to London, at the same time that
Mr. Bennet came from it. The coach, therefore, took them the
first stage of their journey, and brought its master back to
Longbourn.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner went away in all the perplexity about Elizabeth and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) Derbyshire friend that had attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) from that part of the
world. His (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece; and the kind of half-expectation which Mrs.
Gardiner had formed, of their being followed by a letter from
him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), had ended in nothing. Elizabeth had received none since her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
return that could come from Pemberley.

<p/>The present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse
for the lowness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits unnecessary; nothing, therefore,
could be fairly conjectured from _that_, though Elizabeth, who
was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own feelings,
was perfectly aware that, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) known nothing of Darcy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
could have borne the dread of Lydia’s infamy somewhat better. It
would have spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) thought, one sleepless night out of
two.

<p/>When Mr. Bennet arrived, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had all the appearance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) usual
philosophic composure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said as little as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had ever been in
the habit of saying; made no mention of the business that had
taken him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) away, and it was some time before his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters had
courage to speak of it.

<p/>It was not till the afternoon, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had joined them at tea,
that Elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject; and then, on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) briefly expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sorrow for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) must have endured,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, "Say nothing of that. Who should suffer but myself?
It has been my own doing, and I ought to feel it."

<p/>"You must not be too severe upon yourself,<div class="bookquote">" replied Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>You may well warn me against such an evil. Human nature is so
prone to fall into it! No, Lizzy, let me once in my life feel how
much I have been to blame. I am not afraid of being overpowered
by the impression. It will pass away soon enough."

<p/>"Do you suppose them to be in London?"

<p/>"Yes; where else can they be so well concealed?"

<p/>"And Lydia used to want to go to London,<div class="bookquote">" added Kitty.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) is happy then," said her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father drily; "and her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) residence
there will probably be of some duration."

<p/>Then after a short silence he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued:

<p/>"Lizzy, I bear you no ill-will for being justified in your advice
to me last May, which, considering the event, shows some
greatness of mind.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>They were interrupted by Miss Bennet, who came to fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
mother’s tea.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>This is a parade," he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) cried, "which does one good; it gives such
an elegance to misfortune! Another day I will do the same; I will
sit in my library, in my nightcap and powdering gown, and give as
much trouble as I can; or, perhaps, I may defer it till Kitty
runs away."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am not going to run away, papa,"  (<font color='red'><b>Kitty</b></font>)</div>said Kitty fretfully. "If _I_
should ever go to Brighton, I would behave better than Lydia."

<p/>"_You_ go to Brighton. I would not trust you so near it as
Eastbourne for fifty pounds! No, Kitty, I have at last learnt to
be cautious, and you will feel the effects of it. No officer is
ever to enter into my house again, nor even to pass through the
village. Balls will be absolutely prohibited, unless you stand up
with one of your sisters. And you are never to stir out of doors
till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day
in a rational manner.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Kitty, who took all these threats in a serious light, began to
cry.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Well, well," said he (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>), "do not make yourself unhappy. If you are
a good girl for the next ten years, I will take you to a review
at the end of them."
