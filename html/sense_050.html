<p/>After a proper resistance on the part of Mrs. Ferrars, just so violent
and so steady as to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) from that reproach which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) always
seemed fearful of incurring, the reproach of being too amiable, Edward
was admitted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) presence, and pronounced to be again her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) son.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) family had of late been exceedingly fluctuating. For many years of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) life she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had had two sons; but the crime and annihilation of Edward
a few weeks ago, had robbed her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) of one; the similar annihilation of
Robert had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) for a fortnight without any; and now, by the
resuscitation of Edward, she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) had one again.

<p/>In spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) being allowed once more to live, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) did not
feel the continuance of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) existence secure, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) had revealed his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
present engagement; for the publication of that circumstance, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
feared, might give a sudden turn to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) constitution, and carry him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) off
as rapidly as before. With apprehensive caution therefore it was
revealed, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was listened to with unexpected calmness. Mrs. Ferrars
at first reasonably endeavoured to dissuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) from marrying Miss
Dashwood, by every argument in her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) power;—told him (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>), that in Miss Morton
he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) would have a woman of higher rank and larger fortune;—and enforced
the assertion, by observing that Miss Morton was the daughter of a
nobleman with thirty thousand pounds, while Miss Dashwood was only the
daughter of a private gentleman with no more than _three;_ but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
found that, though perfectly admitting the truth of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) representation,
he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was by no means inclined to be guided by it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) judged it wisest,
from the experience of the past, to submit—and therefore, after such an
ungracious delay as she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) own dignity, and as served to
prevent every suspicion of good-will, she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) issued her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) decree of consent
to the marriage of Edward and Elinor.

<p/>What she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would engage to do towards augmenting their income was next to
be considered; and here it plainly appeared, that though Edward was now
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) only son, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) was by no means her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) eldest; for while Robert was
inevitably endowed with a thousand pounds a-year, not the smallest
objection was made against Edward’s taking orders for the sake of two
hundred and fifty at the utmost; nor was anything promised either for
the present or in future, beyond the ten thousand pounds, which had
been given with Fanny.

<p/>It was as much, however, as was desired, and more than was expected, by
Edward and Elinor; and Mrs. Ferrars herself, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) shuffling excuses,
seemed the only person surprised at her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) not giving more.

<p/>With an income quite sufficient to their wants thus secured to them,
they had nothing to wait for after Edward was in possession of the
living, but the readiness of the house, to which Colonel Brandon, with
an eager desire for the accommodation of Elinor, was making
considerable improvements; and after waiting some time for their
completion, after experiencing, as usual, a thousand disappointments
and delays from the unaccountable dilatoriness of the workmen, Elinor,
as usual, broke through the first positive resolution of not marrying
till every thing was ready, and the ceremony took place in Barton
church early in the autumn.

<p/>The first month after their marriage was spent with their friend at the
Mansion-house; from whence they could superintend the progress of the
Parsonage, and direct every thing as they liked on the spot;—could
chuse papers, project shrubberies, and invent a sweep. Mrs. Jennings’s
prophecies, though rather jumbled together, were chiefly fulfilled; for
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was able to visit Edward and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife in their Parsonage by
Michaelmas, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) found in Elinor and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) husband, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) really
believed, one of the happiest couples in the world. They had in fact
nothing to wish for, but the marriage of Colonel Brandon and Marianne,
and rather better pasturage for their cows.

<p/>They were visited on their first settling by almost all their relations
and friends. Mrs. Ferrars came to inspect the happiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) was
almost ashamed of having authorised; and even the Dashwoods were at the
expense of a journey from Sussex to do them honour.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I will not say that I am disappointed, my dear sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>John</b></font>)</div>said John, as
they were walking together one morning before the gates of Delaford
House, "_that_ would be saying too much, for certainly you have been
one of the most fortunate young women in the world, as it is. But, I
confess, it would give me great pleasure to call Colonel Brandon
brother. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) property here, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) place, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) house, every thing is in
such respectable and excellent condition! And his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) woods,—I have not
seen such timber any where in Dorsetshire, as there is now standing in
Delaford Hanger! And though, perhaps, Marianne may not seem exactly the
person to attract him (<font color='blue'><b>Hanger</b></font>), yet I think it would altogether be advisable for
you to have them now frequently staying with you, for as Colonel
Brandon seems a great deal at home, nobody can tell what may happen;
for, when people are much thrown together, and see little of anybody
else,—and it will always be in your power to set her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) off to advantage,
and so forth. In short, you may as well give her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) a chance: you
understand me."

<p/>But though Mrs. Ferrars _did_ come to see them, and always treated them
with the make-believe of decent affection, they were never insulted by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) real favour and preference. _That_ was due to the folly of Robert,
and the cunning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) wife; and it was earned by them before many
months had passed away. The selfish sagacity of the latter, which had
at first drawn Robert into the scrape, was the principal instrument of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) deliverance from it; for her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) respectful humility, assiduous
attentions, and endless flatteries, as soon as the smallest opening was
given for their exercise, reconciled Mrs. Ferrars to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) choice, and
re-established him (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) completely in her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) favour.

<p/>The whole of Lucy’s behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which
crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance
of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however
its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every
advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and
conscience. When Robert first sought her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) acquaintance, and privately
visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) in Bartlett’s Buildings, it was only with the view imputed
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) merely meant to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Ferrars</b></font>) to give up the
engagement; and as there could be nothing to overcome but the affection
of both, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) naturally expected that one or two interviews would settle
the matter. In that point, however, and that only, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) erred; for though
Lucy soon gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) hopes that his (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) eloquence would convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in
_time_, another visit, another conversation, was always wanted to
produce this conviction. Some doubts always lingered in her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) mind when
they parted, which could only be removed by another half hour’s
discourse with himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bartlett</b></font>) attendance was by this means secured, and
the rest followed in course. Instead of talking of Edward, they came
gradually to talk only of Robert,—a subject on which he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had always more
to say than on any other, and in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) soon betrayed an interest
even equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) own; and in short, it became speedily evident to
both, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) had entirely supplanted his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
conquest, proud of tricking Edward, and very proud of marrying
privately without his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother’s consent. What immediately followed is
known. They passed some months in great happiness at Dawlish; for she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
had many relations and old acquaintances to cut—and he (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) drew several
plans for magnificent cottages;—and from thence returning to town,
procured the forgiveness of Mrs. Ferrars, by the simple expedient of
asking it, which, at Lucy’s instigation, was adopted. The forgiveness,
at first, indeed, as was reasonable, comprehended only Robert; and
Lucy, who had owed his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) mother no duty and therefore could have
transgressed none, still remained some weeks longer unpardoned. But
perseverance in humility of conduct and messages, in self-condemnation
for Robert’s offence, and gratitude for the unkindness she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) was treated
with, procured her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) in time the haughty notice which overcame her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucy</b></font>) by its
graciousness, and led soon afterwards, by rapid degrees, to the highest
state of affection and influence. Lucy became as necessary to Mrs.
Ferrars, as either Robert or Fanny; and while Edward was never
cordially forgiven for having once intended to marry her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and Elinor,
though superior to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) in fortune and birth, was spoken of as an
intruder, _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)_ was in every thing considered, and always openly
acknowledged, to be a favourite child. They settled in town, received
very liberal assistance from Mrs. Ferrars, were on the best terms
imaginable with the Dashwoods; and setting aside the jealousies and
ill-will continually subsisting between Fanny and Lucy, in which their
husbands of course took a part, as well as the frequent domestic
disagreements between Robert and Lucy themselves, nothing could exceed
the harmony in which they all lived together.

<p/>What Edward had done to forfeit the right of eldest son, might have
puzzled many people to find out; and what Robert had done to succeed to
it, might have puzzled them still more. It was an arrangement, however,
justified in its effects, if not in its cause; for nothing ever
appeared in Robert’s style of living or of talking to give a suspicion
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) regretting the extent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>) income, as either leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Robert</b></font>)
brother too little, or bringing himself too much;—and if Edward might
be judged from the ready discharge of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) duties in every particular,
from an increasing attachment to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) home, and from the
regular cheerfulness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) spirits, he (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) might be supposed no less
contented with his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) lot, no less free from every wish of an exchange.

<p/>Elinor’s marriage divided her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as little from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) family as could well
be contrived, without rendering the cottage at Barton entirely useless,
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother and sisters spent much more than half their time with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). Mrs. Dashwood was acting on motives of policy as well as pleasure
in the frequency of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) visits at Delaford; for her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) wish of bringing
Marianne and Colonel Brandon together was hardly less earnest, though
rather more liberal than what John had expressed. It was now her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
darling object. Precious as was the company of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) daughter to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
desired nothing so much as to give up its constant enjoyment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
valued friend; and to see Marianne settled at the mansion-house was
equally the wish of Edward and Elinor. They each felt his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) sorrows, and
their own obligations, and Marianne, by general consent, was to be the
reward of all.

<p/>With such a confederacy against her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)—with a knowledge so intimate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>)
goodness—with a conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edward</b></font>) fond attachment to herself, which at
last, though long after it was observable to everybody else—burst on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)—what could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) do?

<p/>Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was born to
discover the falsehood of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own opinions, and to counteract, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
conduct, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) most favourite maxims. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was born to overcome an
affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment
superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand to another!—and _that_ other, a man who had suffered no less
than herself under the event of a former attachment, whom, two years
before, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had considered too old to be married,—and who still sought
the constitutional safeguard of a flannel waistcoat!

<p/>But so it was. Instead of falling a sacrifice to an irresistible
passion, as once she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had fondly flattered herself with
expecting,—instead of remaining even for ever with her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, and
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) only pleasures in retirement and study, as afterwards in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) more calm and sober judgment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had determined on,—she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) found
herself at nineteen, submitting to new attachments, entering on new
duties, placed in a new home, a wife, the mistress of a family, and the
patroness of a village.

<p/>Colonel Brandon was now as happy, as all those who best loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>),
believed he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) deserved to be;—in Marianne he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was consoled for every past
affliction;—her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) regard and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) society restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) mind to animation,
and his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) spirits to cheerfulness; and that Marianne found her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
happiness in forming his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>), was equally the persuasion and delight of
each observing friend. Marianne could never love by halves; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
whole heart became, in time, as much devoted to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) husband, as it had
once been to Willoughby.

<p/>Willoughby could not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) marriage without a pang; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
punishment was soon afterwards complete in the voluntary forgiveness of
Mrs. Smith, who, by stating his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) marriage with a woman of character, as
the source of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) clemency, gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) reason for believing that had he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
behaved with honour towards Marianne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) might at once have been happy
and rich. That his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) repentance of misconduct, which thus brought its own
punishment, was sincere, need not be doubted;—nor that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) long thought
of Colonel Brandon with envy, and of Marianne with regret. But that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
was for ever inconsolable, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) fled from society, or contracted an
habitual gloom of temper, or died of a broken heart, must not be
depended on—for he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) did neither. He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) lived to exert, and frequently to
enjoy himself. His (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) wife was not always out of humour, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) home
always uncomfortable; and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) breed of horses and dogs, and in
sporting of every kind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) found no inconsiderable degree of domestic
felicity.

<p/>For Marianne, however, in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) incivility in surviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
loss, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) always retained that decided regard which interested him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) in
every thing that befell her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) secret standard of
perfection in woman; and many a rising beauty would be slighted by him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
in after-days as bearing no comparison with Mrs. Brandon.

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood was prudent enough to remain at the cottage, without
attempting a removal to Delaford; and fortunately for Sir John and Mrs.
Jennings, when Marianne was taken from them, Margaret had reached an
age highly suitable for dancing, and not very ineligible for being
supposed to have a lover.

<p/>Between Barton and Delaford, there was that constant communication
which strong family affection would naturally dictate; and among the
merits and the happiness of Elinor and Marianne, let it not be ranked
as the least considerable, that though sisters, and living almost
within sight of each other, they could live without disagreement
between themselves, or producing coolness between their husbands.
