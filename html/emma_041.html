<p/>In this state of schemes, and hopes, and connivance, June opened upon Hartfield. To Highbury in general it brought no material change. The Eltons were still talking of a visit from the Sucklings, and of the use to be made of their barouche-landau; and Jane Fairfax was still at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) grandmother's; and as the return of the Campbells from Ireland was again delayed, and August, instead of Midsummer, fixed for it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was likely to remain there full two months longer, provided at least she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) were able to defeat Mrs. Elton's activity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) service, and save herself from being hurried into a delightful situation against her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will.

<p/>Mr. Knightley, who, for some reason best known to himself, had certainly taken an early dislike to Frank Churchill, was only growing to dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) more. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of some double dealing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pursuit of Emma. That Emma was his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) object appeared indisputable. Every thing declared it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own attentions, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's hints, his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mother-in-law's guarded silence; it was all in unison; words, conduct, discretion, and indiscretion, told the same story. But while so many were devoting him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to Emma, and Emma herself making him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) over to Harriet, Mr. Knightley began to suspect him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) of some inclination to trifle with Jane Fairfax. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not understand it; but there were symptoms of intelligence between them he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thought so at least symptoms of admiration on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) side, which, having once observed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not persuade himself to think entirely void of meaning, however he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might wish to escape any of Emma's errors of imagination. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not present when the suspicion first arose. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was dining with the Randalls family, and Jane, at the Eltons'; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen a look, more than a single look, at Miss Fairfax, which, from the admirer of Miss Woodhouse, seemed somewhat out of place. When he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) was again in their company, he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) could not help remembering what he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) had seen; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) avoid observations which, unless it were like Cowper and his (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) fire at twilight,

<p/>"Myself creating what I saw,"


<p/>brought him (<font color='blue'><b>admirer</b></font>) yet stronger suspicion of there being a something of private liking, of private understanding even, between Frank Churchill and Jane.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had walked up one day after dinner, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very often did, to spend his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) evening at Hartfield. Emma and Harriet were going to walk; he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) joined them; and, on returning, they fell in with a larger party, who, like themselves, judged it wisest to take their exercise early, as the weather threatened rain; Mr. and Mrs. Weston and their son, Miss Bates and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece, who had accidentally met. They all united; and, on reaching Hartfield gates, Emma, who knew it was exactly the sort of visiting that would be welcome to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, pressed them all to go in and drink tea with him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). The Randalls party agreed to it immediately; and after a pretty long speech from Miss Bates, which few persons listened to, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) also found it possible to accept dear Miss Woodhouse's most obliging invitation.

<p/>As they were turning into the grounds, Mr. Perry passed by on horseback. The gentlemen spoke of his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) horse.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"By the bye,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill to Mrs. Weston presently, "what became of Mr. Perry's plan of setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage?"

<p/>Mrs. Weston looked surprized, and said, <div class="bookquote">"I did not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) ever had any such plan."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div><p/>"Nay, I had it from you. You wrote me word of it three months ago."

<p/>"Me! impossible!"

<p/>"Indeed you did. I remember it perfectly. You mentioned it as what was certainly to be very soon. Mrs. Perry had told somebody, and was extremely happy about it. It was owing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) persuasion, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) being out in bad weather did him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) a great deal of harm. You must remember it now?"

<p/>"Upon my word I never heard of it till this moment."

<p/>"Never! really, never! Bless me! how could it be? Then I must have dreamt it but I was completely persuaded Miss Smith, you walk as if you were tired. You will not be sorry to find yourself at home."

<p/>"What is this? What is this?<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Weston, " (<font color='red'><b>Perry/Mr. Perry</b></font>)</div>about Perry and a carriage? Is Perry going to set up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage, Frank? I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) can afford it. You had it from himself, had you?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>son</b></font>)</div>replied his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) son, laughing, "I seem to have had it from nobody. Very odd! I really was persuaded of Mrs. Weston's having mentioned it in one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) letters to Enscombe, many weeks ago, with all these particulars but as she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) never heard a syllable of it before, of course it must have been a dream. I am a great dreamer. I dream of every body at Highbury when I am away and when I have gone through my particular friends, then I begin dreaming of Mr. and Mrs. Perry."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is odd though,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>observed his (<font color='blue'><b>dreamer</b></font>) father, "that you should have had such a regular connected dream about people whom it was not very likely you should be thinking of at Enscombe. Perry's setting up his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) carriage! and his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) wife's persuading him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) to it, out of care for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) health just what will happen, I have no doubt, some time or other; only a little premature. What an air of probability sometimes runs through a dream! And at others, what a heap of absurdities it is! Well, Frank, your dream certainly shews that Highbury is in your thoughts when you are absent. Emma, you are a great dreamer, I think?"

<p/>Emma was out of hearing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had hurried on before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) guests to prepare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father for their appearance, and was beyond the reach of Mr. Weston's hint.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, to own the truth,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bates, who had been trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, "if I must speak on this subject, there is no denying that Mr. Frank Churchill might have I do not mean to say that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not dream it I am sure I have sometimes the oddest dreams in the world but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother indeed I do not know who is not and she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had mentioned it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in confidence; she (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) had no objection to her (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because I know I do sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)? Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming. Extraordinary dream, indeed!"

<p/>They were entering the hall. Mr. Knightley's eyes had preceded Miss Bates's in a glance at Jane. From Frank Churchill's face, where he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw confusion suppressed or laughed away, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had involuntarily turned to hers; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was indeed behind, and too busy with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl. Mr. Weston had walked in. The two other gentlemen waited at the door to let her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) pass. Mr. Knightley suspected in Frank Churchill the determination of catching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) eye he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) intently in vain, however, if it were so Jane passed between them into the hall, and looked at neither.

<p/>There was no time for farther remark or explanation. The dream must be borne with, and Mr. Knightley must take his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seat with the rest round the large modern circular table which Emma had introduced at Hartfield, and which none but Emma could have had power to place there and persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father to use, instead of the small-sized Pembroke, on which two of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daily meals had, for forty years been crowded. Tea passed pleasantly, and nobody seemed in a hurry to move.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Woodhouse,"  (<font color='red'><b>Frank Churchill/Frank/Mr. Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, after examining a table behind him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could reach as he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat, "have your nephews taken away their alphabets their box of letters? It used to stand here. Where is it? This is a sort of dull-looking evening, that ought to be treated rather as winter than summer. We had great amusement with those letters one morning. I want to puzzle you again."

<p/>Emma was pleased with the thought; and producing the box, the table was quickly scattered over with alphabets, which no one seemed so much disposed to employ as their two selves. They were rapidly forming words for each other, or for any body else who would be puzzled. The quietness of the game made it particularly eligible for Mr. Woodhouse, who had often been distressed by the more animated sort, which Mr. Weston had occasionally introduced, and who now sat happily occupied in lamenting, with tender melancholy, over the departure of the <div class="bookquote">"poor little boys,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>or in fondly pointing out, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) took up any stray letter near him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), how beautifully Emma had written it.

<p/>Frank Churchill placed a word before Miss Fairfax. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) gave a slight glance round the table, and applied herself to it. Frank was next to Emma, Jane opposite to them and Mr. Knightley so placed as to see them all; and it was his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) object to see as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could, with as little apparent observation. The word was discovered, and with a faint smile pushed away. If meant to be immediately mixed with the others, and buried from sight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have looked on the table instead of looking just across, for it was not mixed; and Harriet, eager after every fresh word, and finding out none, directly took it up, and fell to work. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was sitting by Mr. Knightley, and turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for help. The word was blunder; and as Harriet exultingly proclaimed it, there was a blush on Jane's cheek which gave it a meaning not otherwise ostensible. Mr. Knightley connected it with the dream; but how it could all be, was beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) comprehension. How the delicacy, the discretion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) favourite could have been so lain asleep! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feared there must be some decided involvement. Disingenuousness and double dealing seemed to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) at every turn. These letters were but the vehicle for gallantry and trick. It was a child's play, chosen to conceal a deeper game on Frank Churchill's part.

<p/>With great indignation did he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) continue to observe him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); with great alarm and distrust, to observe also his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) two blinded companions. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw a short word prepared for Emma, and given to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a look sly and demure. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw that Emma had soon made it out, and found it highly entertaining, though it was something which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judged it proper to appear to censure; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, "Nonsense! for shame!" He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) heard Frank Churchill next say, with a glance towards Jane, "I will give it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shall I?<div class="bookquote">" and as clearly heard Emma opposing it with eager laughing warmth. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, no, you must not; you shall not, indeed."

<p/>It was done however. This gallant young man, who seemed to love without feeling, and to recommend himself without complaisance, directly handed over the word to Miss Fairfax, and with a particular degree of sedate civility entreated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to study it. Mr. Knightley's excessive curiosity to know what this word might be, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seize every possible moment for darting his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eye towards it, and it was not long before he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw it to be Dixon. Jane Fairfax's perception seemed to accompany his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) comprehension was certainly more equal to the covert meaning, the superior intelligence, of those five letters so arranged. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was evidently displeased; looked up, and seeing herself watched, blushed more deeply than he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had ever perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>), and saying only, "I did not know that proper names were allowed," pushed away the letters with even an angry spirit, and looked resolved to be engaged by no other word that could be offered. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) face was averted from those who had made the attack, and turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) aunt.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Aye, very true, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane/Jane Fairfax</b></font>)</div>cried the latter, though Jane had not spoken a word "I was just going to say the same thing. It is time for us to be going indeed. The evening is closing in, and grandmama will be looking for us. My dear sir, you are too obliging. We really must wish you good night."

<p/>Jane's alertness in moving, proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) as ready as her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) aunt had preconceived. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was immediately up, and wanting to quit the table; but so many were also moving, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not get away; and Mr. Knightley thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) saw another collection of letters anxiously pushed towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and resolutely swept away by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) unexamined. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was afterwards looking for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) shawl Frank Churchill was looking also it was growing dusk, and the room was in confusion; and how they parted, Mr. Knightley could not tell.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remained at Hartfield after all the rest, his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) thoughts full of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had seen; so full, that when the candles came to assist his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) observations, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) certainly must, as a friend an anxious friend give Emma some hint, ask her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) some question. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) could not see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in a situation of such danger, without trying to preserve her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It was his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) duty.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Pray, Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), "may I ask in what lay the great amusement, the poignant sting of the last word given to you and Miss Fairfax? I saw the word, and am curious to know how it could be so very entertaining to the one, and so very distressing to the other."

<p/>Emma was extremely confused. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not endure to give him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) the true explanation; for though her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions were by no means removed, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was really ashamed of having ever imparted them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cried in evident embarrassment, "it all meant nothing; a mere joke among ourselves."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The joke,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) replied gravely, "seemed confined to you and Mr. Churchill."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would speak again, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would rather busy herself about any thing than speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) sat a little while in doubt. A variety of evils crossed his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind. Interference fruitless interference. Emma's confusion, and the acknowledged intimacy, seemed to declare her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection engaged. Yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) owed it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), to risk any thing that might be involved in an unwelcome interference, rather than her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) welfare; to encounter any thing, rather than the remembrance of neglect in such a cause.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at last, with earnest kindness, <div class="bookquote">"do you think you perfectly understand the degree of acquaintance between the gentleman and lady we have been speaking of?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"Between Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Fairfax? Oh! yes, perfectly. Why do you make a doubt of it?"

<p/>"Have you never at any time had reason to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) admired her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>), or that she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Never, never!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) cried with a most open eagerness " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Never, for the twentieth part of a moment, did such an idea occur to me. And how could it possibly come into your head?"

<p/>"I have lately imagined that I saw symptoms of attachment between them certain expressive looks, which I did not believe meant to be public."

<p/>"Oh! you amuse me excessively. I am delighted to find that you can vouchsafe to let your imagination wander but it will not do very sorry to check you in your first essay but indeed it will not do. There is no admiration between them, I do assure you; and the appearances which have caught you, have arisen from some peculiar circumstances feelings rather of a totally different nature it is impossible exactly to explain: there is a good deal of nonsense in it but the part which is capable of being communicated, which is sense, is, that they are as far from any attachment or admiration for one another, as any two beings in the world can be. That is, I presume it to be so on her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) side, and I can answer for its being so on his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>). I will answer for the gentleman's indifference."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) spoke with a confidence which staggered, with a satisfaction which silenced, Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) was in gay spirits, and would have prolonged the conversation, wanting to hear the particulars of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) suspicions, every look described, and all the wheres and hows of a circumstance which highly entertained her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) gaiety did not meet hers. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) found he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could not be useful, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) feelings were too much irritated for talking. That he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might not be irritated into an absolute fever, by the fire which Mr. Woodhouse's tender habits required almost every evening throughout the year, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) soon afterwards took a hasty leave, and walked home to the coolness and solitude of Donwell Abbey.
