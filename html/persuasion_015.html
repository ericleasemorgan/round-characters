<p/>Sir Walter had taken a very good house in Camden Place, a lofty
dignified situation, such as becomes a man of consequence; and both he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
and Elizabeth were settled there, much to their satisfaction.

<p/>Anne entered it with a sinking heart, anticipating an imprisonment of
many months, and anxiously saying to herself, "Oh! when shall I leave
you again?"  A degree of unexpected cordiality, however, in the welcome
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) received, did her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) good.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and sister were glad to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), for the sake of shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) the house and furniture, and met her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
with kindness.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) making a fourth, when they sat down to dinner, was
noticed as an advantage.

<p/>Mrs Clay was very pleasant, and very smiling, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Clay</b></font>) courtesies and
smiles were more a matter of course.  Anne had always felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
would pretend what was proper on her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) arrival, but the complaisance of
the others was unlooked for.  They were evidently in excellent spirits,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was soon to listen to the causes.  They had no inclination to
listen to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  After laying out for some compliments of being deeply
regretted in their old neighbourhood, which Anne could not pay, they
had only a few faint enquiries to make, before the talk must be all
their own.  Uppercross excited no interest, Kellynch very little: it
was all Bath.

<p/>They had the pleasure of assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) that Bath more than answered
their expectations in every respect.  Their house was undoubtedly the
best in Camden Place; their drawing-rooms had many decided advantages
over all the others which they had either seen or heard of, and the
superiority was not less in the style of the fitting-up, or the taste
of the furniture.  Their acquaintance was exceedingly sought after.
Everybody was wanting to visit them.  They had drawn back from many
introductions, and still were perpetually having cards left by people
of whom they knew nothing.

<p/>Here were funds of enjoyment.  Could Anne wonder that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) father and
sister were happy?  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might not wonder, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must sigh that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father should feel no degradation in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) change, should see nothing to
regret in the duties and dignity of the resident landholder, should
find so much to be vain of in the littlenesses of a town; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
sigh, and smile, and wonder too, as Elizabeth threw open the
folding-doors and walked with exultation from one drawing-room to the
other, boasting of their space; at the possibility of that woman, who
had been mistress of Kellynch Hall, finding extent to be proud of
between two walls, perhaps thirty feet asunder.

<p/>But this was not all which they had to make them happy.  They had Mr
Elliot too.  Anne had a great deal to hear of Mr Elliot.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was not
only pardoned, they were delighted with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been in Bath about
a fortnight; (he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had passed through Bath in November, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) way to
London, when the intelligence of Sir Walter's being settled there had
of course reached him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), though only twenty-four hours in the place, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had not been able to avail himself of it;) but he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had now been a
fortnight in Bath, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) first object on arriving, had been to leave
his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) card in Camden Place, following it up by such assiduous endeavours
to meet, and when they did meet, by such great openness of conduct,
such readiness to apologize for the past, such solicitude to be
received as a relation again, that their former good understanding was
completely re-established.

<p/>They had not a fault to find in him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had explained away all the
appearance of neglect on his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own side.  It had originated in
misapprehension entirely.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had never had an idea of throwing himself
off; he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had feared that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was thrown off, but knew not why, and
delicacy had kept him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) silent.  Upon the hint of having spoken
disrespectfully or carelessly of the family and the family honours, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
was quite indignant.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>), who had ever boasted of being an Elliot, and
whose feelings, as to connection, were only too strict to suit the
unfeudal tone of the present day.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was astonished, indeed, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
character and general conduct must refute it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) could refer Sir
Walter to all who knew him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>); and certainly, the pains he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been taking
on this, the first opportunity of reconciliation, to be restored to the
footing of a relation and heir-presumptive, was a strong proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>)
opinions on the subject.

<p/>The circumstances of his (<font color='blue'><b>heir</b></font>) marriage, too, were found to admit of much
extenuation.  This was an article not to be entered on by himself; but
a very intimate friend of his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>), a Colonel Wallis, a highly respectable
man, perfectly the gentleman, (and not an ill-looking man, Sir Walter
added), who was living in very good style in Marlborough Buildings, and
had, at his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) own particular request, been admitted to their acquaintance
through Mr Elliot, had mentioned one or two things relative to the
marriage, which made a material difference in the discredit of it.

<p/>Colonel Wallis had known Mr Elliot long, had been well acquainted also
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) wife, had perfectly understood the whole story.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was
certainly not a woman of family, but well educated, accomplished, rich,
and excessively in love with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friend.  There had been the charm.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) had sought him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  Without that attraction, not all her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) money would
have tempted Elliot, and Sir Walter was, moreover, assured of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>)
having been a very fine woman.  Here was a great deal to soften the
business.  A very fine woman with a large fortune, in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)!
Sir Walter seemed to admit it as complete apology; and though Elizabeth
could not see the circumstance in quite so favourable a light, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
allowed it be a great extenuation.

<p/>Mr Elliot had called repeatedly, had dined with them once, evidently
delighted by the distinction of being asked, for they gave no dinners
in general; delighted, in short, by every proof of cousinly notice, and
placing his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) whole happiness in being on intimate terms in Camden Place.

<p/>Anne listened, but without quite understanding it.  Allowances, large
allowances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew, must be made for the ideas of those who spoke.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard it all under embellishment.  All that sounded extravagant or
irrational in the progress of the reconciliation might have no origin
but in the language of the relators.  Still, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had the
sensation of there being something more than immediately appeared, in
Mr Elliot's wishing, after an interval of so many years, to be well
received by them.  In a worldly view, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had nothing to gain by being
on terms with Sir Walter; nothing to risk by a state of variance.  In
all probability he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was already the richer of the two, and the Kellynch
estate would as surely be his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hereafter as the title.  A sensible man,
and he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had looked like a very sensible man, why should it be an object
to him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)?  She (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) could only offer one solution; it was, perhaps, for
Elizabeth's sake.  There might really have been a liking formerly,
though convenience and accident had drawn him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) a different way; and now
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) could afford to please himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) might mean to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
addresses to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).  Elizabeth was certainly very handsome, with
well-bred, elegant manners, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) character might never have been
penetrated by Mr Elliot, knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) but in public, and when very young
himself.  How her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) temper and understanding might bear the investigation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) present keener time of life was another concern and rather a
fearful one.  Most earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wish that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might not be too
nice, or too observant if Elizabeth were his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) object; and that Elizabeth
was disposed to believe herself so, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) friend Mrs Clay was
encouraging the idea, seemed apparent by a glance or two between them,
while Mr Elliot's frequent visits were talked of.

<p/>Anne mentioned the glimpses she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had had of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) at Lyme, but without
being much attended to.  "Oh! yes, perhaps, it had been Mr Elliot.
They did not know.  It might be him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), perhaps.<div class="bookquote">"  They could not listen
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) description of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  They were describing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) themselves; Sir
Walter especially.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did justice to his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) very gentlemanlike
appearance, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) air of elegance and fashion, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) good shaped face, his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
sensible eye; but, at the same time, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>must lament his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) being very much
under-hung, a defect which time seemed to have increased; nor could he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
pretend to say that ten years had not altered almost every feature for
the worse.  Mr Elliot appeared to think that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) (Sir Walter) was
looking exactly as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had done when they last parted;" but Sir Walter
had "not been able to return the compliment entirely, which had
embarrassed him (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did not mean to complain, however.  Mr Elliot was
better to look at than most men, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had no objection to being seen
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) anywhere.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr Elliot, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) friends in Marlborough Buildings, were talked of the
whole evening.  " (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>Colonel Wallis had been so impatient to be introduced
to them! and Mr Elliot so anxious that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) should!" and there was a Mrs
Wallis, at present known only to them by description, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was in
daily expectation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) confinement; but Mr Elliot spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) as <div class="bookquote">"a
most charming woman, quite worthy of being known in Camden Place,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>and
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) recovered they were to be acquainted.  Sir Walter
thought much of Mrs Wallis; she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) was said to be an excessively pretty
woman, beautiful.  "He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) longed to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) might make some
amends for the many very plain faces he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was continually passing in the
streets.  The worst of Bath was the number of its plain women.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) did
not mean to say that there were no pretty women, but the number of the
plain was out of all proportion.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had frequently observed, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>)
walked, that one handsome face would be followed by thirty, or
five-and-thirty frights; and once, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) had stood in a shop on Bond
Street, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>) had counted eighty-seven women go by, one after another,
without there being a tolerable face among them.  It had been a frosty
morning, to be sure, a sharp frost, which hardly one woman in a
thousand could stand the test of.  But still, there certainly were a
dreadful multitude of ugly women in Bath; and as for the men!  they
were infinitely worse.  Such scarecrows as the streets were full of!
It was evident how little the women were used to the sight of anything
tolerable, by the effect which a man of decent appearance produced.  He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had never walked anywhere arm-in-arm with Colonel Wallis (who was a
fine military figure, though sandy-haired) without observing that every
woman's eye was upon him (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>); every woman's eye was sure to be upon Colonel
Wallis."  Modest Sir Walter!  He (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) was not allowed to escape, however.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) daughter and Mrs Clay united in hinting that Colonel Wallis's
companion might have as good a figure as Colonel Wallis, and certainly
was not sandy-haired.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How is Mary looking?"  (<font color='red'><b>Walter</b></font>)</div>said Sir Walter, in the height of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) good
humour.  <div class="bookquote">"The last time I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a red nose, but I hope that
may not happen every day."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! no, that must have been quite accidental.  In general she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) has been
in very good health and very good looks since Michaelmas."

<p/>"If I thought it would not tempt her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) to go out in sharp winds, and grow
coarse, I would send her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) a new hat and pelisse.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Anne was considering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should venture to suggest that a gown,
or a cap, would not be liable to any such misuse, when a knock at the
door suspended everything.  " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>A knock at the door! and so late!  It was
ten o'clock.  Could it be Mr Elliot?  They knew he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) was to dine in
Lansdown Crescent.  It was possible that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) might stop in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) way home
to ask them how they did.  They could think of no one else.  Mrs Clay
decidedly thought it Mr Elliot's knock."  Mrs Clay was right.  With all
the state which a butler and foot-boy could give, Mr Elliot was ushered
into the room.

<p/>It was the same, the very same man, with no difference but of dress.
Anne drew a little back, while the others received his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) compliments, and
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) apologies for calling at so unusual an hour, but <div class="bookquote">"he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
could not be so near without wishing to know that neither she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) nor her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
friend had taken cold the day before,"  (<font color='red'><b>sister apologies</b></font>)</div>&c. &c; which was all as
politely done, and as politely taken, as possible, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) part must
follow then.  Sir Walter talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>Walter</b></font>) youngest daughter; <div class="bookquote">"Mr Elliot
must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) leave to present him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) to his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) youngest daughter"  (<font color='red'><b>daughter</b></font>)</div>(there was
no occasion for remembering Mary); and Anne, smiling and blushing, very
becomingly shewed to Mr Elliot the pretty features which he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had by no
means forgotten, and instantly saw, with amusement at his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) little start
of surprise, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had not been at all aware of who she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
looked completely astonished, but not more astonished than pleased; his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
eyes brightened! and with the most perfect alacrity he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) welcomed the
relationship, alluded to the past, and entreated to be received as an
acquaintance already.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was quite as good-looking as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had appeared
at Lyme, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) countenance improved by speaking, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) manners were so
exactly what they ought to be, so polished, so easy, so particularly
agreeable, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could compare them in excellence to only one
person's manners.  They were not the same, but they were, perhaps,
equally good.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sat down with them, and improved their conversation very much.
There could be no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) being a sensible man.  Ten minutes were
enough to certify that.  His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) tone, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) expressions, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) choice of
subject, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) knowing where to stop; it was all the operation of a
sensible, discerning mind.  As soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could, he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) began to talk to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) of Lyme, wanting to compare opinions respecting the place, but
especially wanting to speak of the circumstance of their happening to
be guests in the same inn at the same time; to give his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) own route,
understand something of hers, and regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should have lost such
an opportunity of paying his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) respects to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) gave him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) a short
account of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) party and business at Lyme.  His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) regret increased as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
listened.  He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had spent his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) whole solitary evening in the room
adjoining theirs; had heard voices, mirth continually; thought they
must be a most delightful set of people, longed to be with them, but
certainly without the smallest suspicion of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) possessing the shadow
of a right to introduce himself.  If he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had but asked who the party
were!  The name of Musgrove would have told him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) enough.  <div class="bookquote">"Well, it
would serve to cure him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) of an absurd practice of never asking a
question at an inn, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had adopted, when quite a young man, on
the principal of its being very ungenteel to be curious.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a man</b></font>)</div>The notions of a young man of one or two and twenty," said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), "as to
what is necessary in manners to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) quite the thing, are more
absurd, I believe, than those of any other set of beings in the world.
The folly of the means they often employ is only to be equalled by the
folly of what they have in view."

<p/>But he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must not be addressing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) reflections to Anne alone: he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
it; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was soon diffused again among the others, and it was only at
intervals that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could return to Lyme.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) enquiries, however, produced at length an account of the scene she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
had been engaged in there, soon after his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) leaving the place.  Having
alluded to <div class="bookquote">"an accident,"   (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must hear the whole.  When he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) questioned,
Sir Walter and Elizabeth began to question also, but the difference in
their manner of doing it could not be unfelt.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could only compare
Mr Elliot to Lady Russell, in the wish of really comprehending what had
passed, and in the degree of concern for what she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) must have suffered in
witnessing it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) staid an hour with them.  The elegant little clock on the mantel-piece
had struck <div class="bookquote">"eleven with its silver sounds,"  (<font color='red'><b>the watchman</b></font>)</div>and the watchman was
beginning to be heard at a distance telling the same tale, before Mr
Elliot or any of them seemed to feel that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had been there long.

<p/>Anne could not have supposed it possible that her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) first evening in
Camden Place could have passed so well!
