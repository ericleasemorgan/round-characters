<p/>The sudden termination of Colonel Brandon’s visit at the park, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
steadiness in concealing its cause, filled the mind, and raised the
wonder of Mrs. Jennings for two or three days; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was a great
wonderer, as every one must be who takes a very lively interest in all
the comings and goings of all their acquaintance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wondered, with
little intermission what could be the reason of it; was sure there must
be some bad news, and thought over every kind of distress that could
have befallen him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>), with a fixed determination that he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should not escape
them all.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Something very melancholy must be the matter, I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>). "I
could see it in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) face. Poor man! I am afraid his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) circumstances may
be bad. The estate at Delaford was never reckoned more than two
thousand a year, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) brother left everything sadly involved. I do
think he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must have been sent for about money matters, for what else can
it be? I wonder whether it is so. I would give anything to know the
truth of it. Perhaps it is about Miss Williams and, by the bye, I dare
say it is, because he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) looked so conscious when I mentioned her (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>). May be
she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is ill in town; nothing in the world more likely, for I have a
notion she (<font color='blue'><b>Williams</b></font>) is always rather sickly. I would lay any wager it is about
Miss Williams. It is not so very likely he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) should be distressed in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
circumstances _now_, for he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is a very prudent man, and to be sure must
have cleared the estate by this time. I wonder what it can be! May be
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister is worse at Avignon, and has sent for him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) over. His (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) setting
off in such a hurry seems very like it. Well, I wish him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) out of all his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
trouble with all my heart, and a good wife into the bargain."

<p/>So wondered, so talked Mrs. Jennings. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion varying with every
fresh conjecture, and all seeming equally probable as they arose.
Elinor, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt really interested in the welfare of Colonel
Brandon, could not bestow all the wonder on his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) going so suddenly away,
which Mrs. Jennings was desirous of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) feeling; for besides that the
circumstance did not in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) opinion justify such lasting amazement or
variety of speculation, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wonder was otherwise disposed of. It was
engrossed by the extraordinary silence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister and Willoughby on
the subject, which they must know to be peculiarly interesting to them
all. As this silence continued, every day made it appear more strange
and more incompatible with the disposition of both. Why they should not
openly acknowledge to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother and herself, what their constant
behaviour to each other declared to have taken place, Elinor could not
imagine.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could easily conceive that marriage might not be immediately in
their power; for though Willoughby was independent, there was no reason
to believe him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) rich. His (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) estate had been rated by Sir John at about six
or seven hundred a year; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) lived at an expense to which that
income could hardly be equal, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had himself often complained of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) poverty. But for this strange kind of secrecy maintained by them
relative to their engagement, which in fact concealed nothing at all,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could not account; and it was so wholly contradictory to their
general opinions and practice, that a doubt sometimes entered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind
of their being really engaged, and this doubt was enough to prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
making any inquiry of Marianne.

<p/>Nothing could be more expressive of attachment to them all, than
Willoughby’s behaviour. To Marianne it had all the distinguishing
tenderness which a lover’s heart could give, and to the rest of the
family it was the affectionate attention of a son and a brother. The
cottage seemed to be considered and loved by him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) home; many more
of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) hours were spent there than at Allenham; and if no general
engagement collected them at the park, the exercise which called him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
out in the morning was almost certain of ending there, where the rest
of the day was spent by himself at the side of Marianne, and by his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
favourite pointer at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feet.

<p/>One evening in particular, about a week after Colonel Brandon left the
country, his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) heart seemed more than usually open to every feeling of
attachment to the objects around him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>); and on Mrs. Dashwood’s happening
to mention her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) design of improving the cottage in the spring, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) warmly
opposed every alteration of a place which affection had established as
perfect with him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What!"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) exclaimed—"Improve this dear cottage! No. _That_ I will
never consent to. Not a stone must be added to its walls, not an inch
to its size, if my feelings are regarded."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do not be alarmed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Dashwood</b></font>)</div>said Miss Dashwood, "nothing of the kind will be
done; for my mother will never have money enough to attempt it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am heartily glad of it,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) cried. "May she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) always be poor, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
can employ her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) riches no better."

<p/>"Thank you, Willoughby. But you may be assured that I would not
sacrifice one sentiment of local attachment of yours, or of any one
whom I loved, for all the improvements in the world. Depend upon it
that whatever unemployed sum may remain, when I make up my accounts in
the spring, I would even rather lay it uselessly by than dispose of it
in a manner so painful to you. But are you really so attached to this
place as to see no defect in it?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). "To me it is faultless. Nay, more, I consider it as
the only form of building in which happiness is attainable, and were I
rich enough I would instantly pull Combe down, and build it up again in
the exact plan of this cottage."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"With dark narrow stairs and a kitchen that smokes, I suppose,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>said
Elinor.

<p/>"Yes,<div class="bookquote">" cried he (<font color='blue'><b>Combe</b></font>) in the same eager tone, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>with all and every thing
belonging to it;—in no one convenience or inconvenience about it,
should the least variation be perceptible. Then, and then only, under
such a roof, I might perhaps be as happy at Combe as I have been at
Barton."

<p/>"I flatter myself,<div class="bookquote">" replied Elinor, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>that even under the disadvantage
of better rooms and a broader staircase, you will hereafter find your
own house as faultless as you now do this."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There certainly are circumstances,"  (<font color='red'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)</div>said Willoughby, "which might
greatly endear it to me; but this place will always have one claim of
my affection, which no other can possibly share.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood looked with pleasure at Marianne, whose fine eyes were
fixed so expressively on Willoughby, as plainly denoted how well she (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>)
understood him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>How often did I wish," added he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), "when I was at Allenham this time
twelvemonth, that Barton cottage were inhabited! I never passed within
view of it without admiring its situation, and grieving that no one
should live in it. How little did I then think that the very first news
I should hear from Mrs. Smith, when I next came into the country, would
be that Barton cottage was taken: and I felt an immediate satisfaction
and interest in the event, which nothing but a kind of prescience of
what happiness I should experience from it, can account for. Must it
not have been so, Marianne?" speaking to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in a lowered voice. Then
continuing his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) former tone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) said, "And yet this house you would
spoil, Mrs. Dashwood? You would rob it of its simplicity by imaginary
improvement! and this dear parlour in which our acquaintance first
began, and in which so many happy hours have been since spent by us
together, you would degrade to the condition of a common entrance, and
every body would be eager to pass through the room which has hitherto
contained within itself more real accommodation and comfort than any
other apartment of the handsomest dimensions in the world could
possibly afford.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Dashwood again assured him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) that no alteration of the kind should
be attempted.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a woman</b></font>)</div>You are a good woman," he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) warmly replied. "Your promise makes me easy.
Extend it a little farther, and it will make me happy. Tell me that not
only your house will remain the same, but that I shall ever find you
and yours as unchanged as your dwelling; and that you will always
consider me with the kindness which has made everything belonging to
you so dear to me.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The promise was readily given, and Willoughby’s behaviour during the
whole of the evening declared at once his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) affection and happiness.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Shall we see you tomorrow to dinner?" said Mrs. Dashwood, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was
leaving them. "I do not ask you to come in the morning, for we must
walk to the park, to call on Lady Middleton."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) engaged to be with them by four o’clock.
