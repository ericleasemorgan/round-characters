<p/>The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning, and Mr. Collins
having been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) parting
obeisance, was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence, of
their appearing in very good health, and in as tolerable spirits
as could be expected, after the melancholy scene so lately gone
through at Rosings. To Rosings he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) then hastened, to console Lady
Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter; and on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return brought back, with
great satisfaction, a message from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) ladyship, importing that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt herself so dull as to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) very desirous of having
them all to dine with her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that,
had she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chosen it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might by this time have been presented to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) future niece; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) think, without a smile, of
what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship’s indignation would have been. "What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
have said? how would she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) have behaved?" were questions with which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) amused herself.

<p/>Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings party. <div class="bookquote">"I
assure you, I feel it exceedingly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Catherine/Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Lady Catherine; "I
believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I
am particularly attached to these young men, and know them to be
so much attached to me! They were excessively sorry to go! But so
they always are. The dear Colonel rallied his (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) spirits tolerably
till just at last; but Darcy seemed to feel it most acutely,
more, I think, than last year. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attachment to Rosings
certainly increases."

<p/>Mr. Collins had a compliment, and an allusion to throw in here,
which were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.

<p/>Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed
out of spirits, and immediately accounting for it herself, by
supposing that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did not like to go home again so soon, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
added:

<p/>"But if that is the case, you must write to your mother and beg
that you may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad
of your company, I am sure."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am much obliged to your ladyship for your kind invitation,"
 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, "but it is not in my power to accept it. I
must be in town next Saturday."

<p/>"Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I
expected you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before
you came. There can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs.
Bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight."

<p/>"But my father cannot. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote last week to hurry my return."

<p/>"Oh! your father of course may spare you, if your mother can.
Daughters are never of so much consequence to a father. And if
you will stay another _month_ complete, it will be in my power to
take one of you as far as London, for I am going there early in
June, for a week; and as Dawson does not object to the
barouche-box, there will be very good room for one of you—and
indeed, if the weather should happen to be cool, I should not
object to taking you both, as you are neither of you large."

<p/>"You are all kindness, madam; but I believe we must abide by our
original plan.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lady Catherine seemed resigned. " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Collins</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Collins, you must send a
servant with them. You know I always speak my mind, and I cannot
bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves.
It is highly improper. You must contrive to send somebody. I have
the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing. Young
women should always be properly guarded and attended, according
to their situation in life. When my niece Georgiana went to
Ramsgate last summer, I made a point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) having two
men-servants go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). Miss Darcy, the daughter of Mr. Darcy,
of Pemberley, and Lady Anne, could not have appeared with
propriety in a different manner. I am excessively attentive to
all those things. You must send John with the young ladies, Mrs.
Collins. I am glad it occurred to me to mention it; for it would
really be discreditable to _you_ to let them go alone."

<p/>"My uncle is to send a servant for us."

<p/>"Oh! Your uncle! He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) keeps a man-servant, does he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)? I am very glad
you have somebody who thinks of these things. Where shall you
change horses? Oh! Bromley, of course. If you mention my name at
the Bell, you will be attended to."

<p/>Lady Catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their
journey, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did not answer them all herself, attention
was necessary, which Elizabeth believed to be lucky for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); or,
with a mind so occupied, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have forgotten where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was.
Reflection must be reserved for solitary hours; whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
alone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) gave way to it as the greatest relief; and not a day
went by without a solitary walk, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might indulge in
all the delight of unpleasant recollections.

<p/>Mr. Darcy’s letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in a fair way of soon knowing by
heart. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) studied every sentence; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings towards its
writer were at times widely different. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) remembered the
style of his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) address, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was still full of indignation; but when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) considered how unjustly she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had condemned and upbraided him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>),
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anger was turned against herself; and his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) disappointed
feelings became the object of compassion. His (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) attachment excited
gratitude, his (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) general character respect; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not
approve him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>); nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) for a moment repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) refusal, or
feel the slightest inclination ever to see him (<font color='blue'><b>writer</b></font>) again. In her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
past behaviour, there was a constant source of vexation and
regret; and in the unhappy defects of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family, a subject of
yet heavier chagrin. They were hopeless of remedy. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father,
contented with laughing at them, would never exert himself to
restrain the wild giddiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) youngest daughters; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother, with manners so far from right herself, was entirely
insensible of the evil. Elizabeth had frequently united with Jane
in an endeavour to check the imprudence of Catherine and Lydia;
but while they were supported by their mother’s indulgence, what
chance could there be of improvement? Catherine, weak-spirited,
irritable, and completely under Lydia’s guidance, had been always
affronted by their advice; and Lydia, self-willed and careless,
would scarcely give them a hearing. They were ignorant, idle, and
vain. While there was an officer in Meryton, they would flirt
with him (<font color='blue'><b>officer</b></font>); and while Meryton was within a walk of Longbourn, they
would be going there forever.

<p/>Anxiety on Jane’s behalf was another prevailing concern; and Mr.
Darcy’s explanation, by restoring Bingley to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) former good
opinion, heightened the sense of what Jane had lost. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
affection was proved to have been sincere, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) conduct
cleared of all blame, unless any could attach to the implicitness
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) confidence in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friend. How grievous then was the
thought that, of a situation so desirable in every respect, so
replete with advantage, so promising for happiness, Jane had been
deprived, by the folly and indecorum of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own family!

<p/>When to these recollections was added the development of
Wickham’s character, it may be easily believed that the happy
spirits which had seldom been depressed before, were now so much
affected as to make it almost impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to appear
tolerably cheerful.

<p/>Their engagements at Rosings were as frequent during the last
week of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) stay as they had been at first. The very last evening
was spent there; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) ladyship again enquired minutely into
the particulars of their journey, gave them directions as to the
best method of packing, and was so urgent on the necessity of
placing gowns in the only right way, that Maria thought herself
obliged, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) return, to undo all the work of the morning, and
pack her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) trunk afresh.

<p/>When they parted, Lady Catherine, with great condescension,
wished them a good journey, and invited them to come to Hunsford
again next year; and Miss de Bourgh exerted herself so far as to
curtsey and hold out her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand to both.
