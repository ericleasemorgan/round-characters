<p/>As soon as they were gone, Elizabeth walked out to recover her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
spirits; or in other words, to dwell without interruption on
those subjects that must deaden them more. Mr. Darcy’s behaviour
astonished and vexed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came only to be silent, grave, and indifferent,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"did he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) come at all?"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could settle it in no way that gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) pleasure.

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could be still amiable, still pleasing, to my uncle and aunt,
when he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was in town; and why not to me? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fears me, why come
hither? If he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) no longer cares for me, why silent? Teasing,
teasing, man! I will think no more about him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>).<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the
approach of her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) sister, who joined her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) with a cheerful look,
which showed her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) better satisfied with their visitors, than
Elizabeth.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Now," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "that this first meeting is over, I feel
perfectly easy. I know my own strength, and I shall never be
embarrassed again by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) coming. I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dines here on
Tuesday. It will then be publicly seen that, on both sides, we
meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, very indifferent indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, laughingly. "Oh,
Jane, take care."

<p/>"My dear Lizzy, you cannot think me so weak, as to be in danger
now?"

<p/>"I think you are in very great danger of making him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) as much in
love with you as ever."

<p/>They did not see the gentlemen again till Tuesday; and Mrs.
Bennet, in the meanwhile, was giving way to all the happy
schemes, which the good humour and common politeness of Bingley,
in half an hour’s visit, had revived.

<p/>On Tuesday there was a large party assembled at Longbourn; and
the two who were most anxiously expected, to the credit of their
punctuality as sportsmen, were in very good time. When they
repaired to the dining-room, Elizabeth eagerly watched to see
whether Bingley would take the place, which, in all their former
parties, had belonged to him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>), by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) prudent mother,
occupied by the same ideas, forbore to invite him (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) to sit by
herself. On entering the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) seemed to hesitate; but Jane
happened to look round, and happened to smile: it was decided. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
placed himself by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>).

<p/>Elizabeth, with a triumphant sensation, looked towards his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>)
friend. He (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) bore it with noble indifference, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would have
imagined that Bingley had received his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) sanction to be happy, had
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) not seen his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) eyes likewise turned towards Mr. Darcy, with an
expression of half-laughing alarm.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister was such, during dinner time, as
showed an admiration of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), which, though more guarded than
formerly, persuaded Elizabeth, that if left wholly to himself,
Jane’s happiness, and his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) own, would be speedily secured. Though
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared not depend upon the consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) yet received
pleasure from observing his (<font color='blue'><b>they</b></font>) behaviour. It gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) all the
animation that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spirits could boast; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in no
cheerful humour. Mr. Darcy was almost as far from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) as the
table could divide them. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was on one side of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either,
or make either appear to advantage. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was not near enough to
hear any of their discourse, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see how seldom they
spoke to each other, and how formal and cold was their manner
whenever they did. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s ungraciousness, made the sense of
what they owed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) more painful to Elizabeth’s mind; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
would, at times, have given anything to be privileged to tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of
the family.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity
of bringing them together; that the whole of the visit would not
pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of
conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
entrance. Anxious and uneasy, the period which passed in the
drawing-room, before the gentlemen came, was wearisome and dull
to a degree that almost made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncivil. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked forward to
their entrance as the point on which all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) chance of pleasure
for the evening must depend.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does not come to me, _then_,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I shall give him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
up for ever."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>The gentlemen came; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have
answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hopes; but, alas! the ladies had crowded round the
table, where Miss Bennet was making tea, and Elizabeth pouring
out the coffee, in so close a confederacy that there was not a
single vacancy near her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) which would admit of a chair. And on the
gentlemen’s approaching, one of the girls moved closer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
than ever, and said, in a whisper:

<p/>"The men shan’t come and part us, I am determined. We want none
of them; do we?"

<p/>Darcy had walked away to another part of the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) followed
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, envied everyone to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) spoke, had scarcely
patience enough to help anybody to coffee; and then was enraged
against herself for being so silly!

<p/>"A man who has once been refused! How could I ever be foolish
enough to expect a renewal of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) love? Is there one among the
sex, who would not protest against such a weakness as a second
proposal to the same woman? There is no indignity so abhorrent to
their feelings!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) was a little revived, however, by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) bringing back his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
coffee cup himself; and she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) seized the opportunity of saying:

<p/>"Is your sister at Pemberley still?"

<p/>"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) will remain there till Christmas."

<p/>"And quite alone? Have all her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) friends left her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Mrs. Annesley is with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>). The others have been gone on to
Scarborough, these three weeks."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>) could think of nothing more to say; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) wished to
converse with her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might have better success. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) stood by her (<font color='blue'><b>Annesley</b></font>),
however, for some minutes, in silence; and, at last, on the young
lady’s whispering to Elizabeth again, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) walked away.

<p/>When the tea-things were removed, and the card-tables placed, the
ladies all rose, and Elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined
by him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), when all her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) views were overthrown by seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) fall a
victim to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s rapacity for whist players, and in a few
moments after seated with the rest of the party. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) now lost
every expectation of pleasure. They were confined for the evening
at different tables, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had nothing to hope, but that his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
eyes were so often turned towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) side of the room, as to
make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) play as unsuccessfully as herself.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet had designed to keep the two Netherfield gentlemen to
supper; but their carriage was unluckily ordered before any of
the others, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had no opportunity of detaining them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well girls,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), as soon as they were left to themselves,
"What say you to the day? I think every thing has passed off
uncommonly well, I assure you. The dinner was as well dressed as
any I ever saw. The venison was roasted to a turn—and everybody
said they never saw so fat a haunch. The soup was fifty times
better than what we had at the Lucases’ last week; and even Mr.
Darcy acknowledged, that the partridges were remarkably well
done; and I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has two or three French cooks at least.
And, my dear Jane, I never saw you look in greater beauty. Mrs.
Long said so too, for I asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) whether you did not. And what
do you think she (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) said besides? <div class="bookquote">‘Ah! Mrs. Bennet, we shall have
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) at Netherfield at last.’  (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did indeed. I do think Mrs. Long
is as good a creature as ever lived—and her (<font color='blue'><b>Long</b></font>) nieces are very
pretty behaved girls, and not at all handsome: I like them
prodigiously.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Bennet, in short, was in very great spirits; she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had seen
enough of Bingley’s behaviour to Jane, to be convinced that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
would get him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) at last; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) expectations of advantage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
family, when in a happy humour, were so far beyond reason, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite disappointed at not seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) there again the next
day, to make his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) proposals.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div>It has been a very agreeable day," said Miss Bennet to
Elizabeth. "The party seemed so well selected, so suitable one
with the other. I hope we may often meet again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth smiled.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>Lizzy, you must not do so. You must not suspect me. It mortifies
me. I assure you that I have now learnt to enjoy his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) conversation
as an agreeable and sensible young man, without having a wish
beyond it. I am perfectly satisfied, from what his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) manners now
are, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) never had any design of engaging my affection. It is
only that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is blessed with greater sweetness of address, and a
stronger desire of generally pleasing, than any other man."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are very cruel,"  (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) sister, "you will not let me
smile, and are provoking me to it every moment."

<p/>"How hard it is in some cases to be believed!"

<p/>"And how impossible in others!"

<p/>"But why should you wish to persuade me that I feel more than I
acknowledge?"

<p/>"That is a question which I hardly know how to answer. We all
love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth
knowing. Forgive me; and if you persist in indifference, do not
make _me_ your confidante."
