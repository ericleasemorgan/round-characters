<p/>Mr. Collins was not a sensible man, and the deficiency of nature
had been but little assisted by education or society; the
greatest part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) life having been spent under the guidance of
an illiterate and miserly father; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) belonged to one
of the universities, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had merely kept the necessary terms,
without forming at it any useful acquaintance. The subjection in
which his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) father had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) up had given him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) originally
great humility of manner; but it was now a good deal counteracted
by the self-conceit of a weak head, living in retirement, and the
consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity. A
fortunate chance had recommended him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to Lady Catherine de Bourgh
when the living of Hunsford was vacant; and the respect which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
felt for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) high rank, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) veneration for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) as his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
patroness, mingling with a very good opinion of himself, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
authority as a clergyman, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) right as a rector, made him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness, self-importance
and humility.

<p/>Having now a good house and a very sufficient income, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intended
to marry; and in seeking a reconciliation with the Longbourn
family he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had a wife in view, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) meant to choose one of the
daughters, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) found them as handsome and amiable as they were
represented by common report. This was his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan of amends—of
atonement—for inheriting their father’s estate; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) thought it
an excellent one, full of eligibility and suitableness, and
excessively generous and disinterested on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own part.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) plan did not vary on seeing them. Miss Bennet’s lovely face
confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) views, and established all his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) strictest notions of
what was due to seniority; and for the first evening _she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)_ was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) settled choice. The next morning, however, made an
alteration; for in a quarter of an hour’s _tête-à-tête_ with Mrs.
Bennet before breakfast, a conversation beginning with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
parsonage-house, and leading naturally to the avowal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
hopes, that a mistress might be found for it at Longbourn,
produced from her (<font color='blue'><b>mistress</b></font>), amid very complaisant smiles and general
encouragement, a caution against the very Jane he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had fixed on.
<div class="bookquote">"As to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) _younger_ daughters, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not take upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to
say—she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not positively answer—but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) did not _know_ of any
prepossession; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) _eldest_ daughter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must just mention—she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
felt it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) to hint, was likely to be very soon
engaged."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Collins had only to change from Jane to Elizabeth—and it was
soon done—done while Mrs. Bennet was stirring the fire.
Elizabeth, equally next to Jane in birth and beauty, succeeded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) of course.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet treasured up the hint, and trusted that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) might
soon have two daughters married; and the man whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could not
bear to speak of the day before was now high in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) good graces.

<p/>Lydia’s intention of walking to Meryton was not forgotten; every
sister except Mary agreed to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and Mr. Collins was to
attend them, at the request of Mr. Bennet, who was most anxious
to get rid of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and have his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) library to himself; for thither
Mr. Collins had followed him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) after breakfast; and there he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) would
continue, nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the
collection, but really talking to Mr. Bennet, with little
cessation, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) house and garden at Hunsford. Such doings
discomposed Mr. Bennet exceedingly. In his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) library he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had been
always sure of leisure and tranquillity; and though prepared, as
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) told Elizabeth, to meet with folly and conceit in every other
room of the house, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was used to be free from them there; his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
civility, therefore, was most prompt in inviting Mr. Collins to
join his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) daughters in their walk; and Mr. Collins, being in fact
much better fitted for a walker than a reader, was extremely
pleased to close his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) large book, and go.

<p/>In pompous nothings on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) side, and civil assents on that of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
cousins, their time passed till they entered Meryton. The
attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by
_him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_. Their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in
quest of the officers, and nothing less than a very smart bonnet
indeed, or a really new muslin in a shop window, could recall
them.

<p/>But the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man,
whom they had never seen before, of most gentlemanlike
appearance, walking with another officer on the other side of the
way. The officer was the very Mr. Denny concerning whose return
from London Lydia came to enquire, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) bowed as they passed.
All were struck with the stranger’s air, all wondered who he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>)
could be; and Kitty and Lydia, determined if possible to find
out, led the way across the street, under pretense of wanting
something in an opposite shop, and fortunately had just gained
the pavement when the two gentlemen, turning back, had reached
the same spot. Mr. Denny addressed them directly, and entreated
permission to introduce his (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) friend, Mr. Wickham, who had returned
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) the day before from town, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) was happy to say had
accepted a commission in their corps. This was exactly as it
should be; for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
completely charming. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appearance was greatly in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) favour; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had all the best part of beauty, a fine countenance, a good
figure, and very pleasing address. The introduction was followed
up on his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) side by a happy readiness of conversation—a readiness
at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming; and the whole
party were still standing and talking together very agreeably,
when the sound of horses drew their notice, and Darcy and Bingley
were seen riding down the street. On distinguishing the ladies of
the group, the two gentlemen came directly towards them, and
began the usual civilities. Bingley was the principal spokesman,
and Miss Bennet the principal object. He (<font color='blue'><b>spokesman</b></font>) was then, he (<font color='blue'><b>spokesman</b></font>) said, on
his (<font color='blue'><b>spokesman</b></font>) way to Longbourn on purpose to enquire after her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Mr. Darcy
corroborated it with a bow, and was beginning to determine not to
fix his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) eyes on Elizabeth, when they were suddenly arrested by
the sight of the stranger, and Elizabeth happening to see the
countenance of both as they looked at each other, was all
astonishment at the effect of the meeting. Both changed colour,
one looked white, the other red. Mr. Wickham, after a few
moments, touched his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) hat—a salutation which Mr. Darcy just
deigned to return. What could be the meaning of it? It was
impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know.

<p/>In another minute, Mr. Bingley, but without seeming to have
noticed what passed, took leave and rode on with his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Mr. Denny and Mr. Wickham walked with the young ladies to the
door of Mr. Phillip’s house, and then made their bows, in spite
of Miss Lydia’s pressing entreaties that they should come in, and
even in spite of Mrs. Phillips’s throwing up the parlour window
and loudly seconding the invitation.

<p/>Mrs. Phillips was always glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces; and the two
eldest, from their recent absence, were particularly welcome, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) was eagerly expressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) surprise at their sudden return
home, which, as their own carriage had not fetched them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
should have known nothing about, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had not happened to see
Mr. Jones’s shop-boy in the street, who had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) that they
were not to send any more draughts to Netherfield because the
Miss Bennets were come away, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) civility was claimed
towards Mr. Collins by Jane’s introduction of him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) received
him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) very best politeness, which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) returned with as much
more, apologising for his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) intrusion, without any previous
acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>), which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) could not help flattering
himself, however, might be justified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) relationship to the
young ladies who introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) notice. Mrs. Phillips was
quite awed by such an excess of good breeding; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by
exclamations and enquiries about the other; of whom, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
could only tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) nieces what they already knew, that Mr. Denny
had brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) from London, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) was to have a
lieutenant’s commission in the ——shire. She (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) had been watching him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>)
the last hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) said, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) walked up and down the street, and
had Mr. Wickham appeared, Kitty and Lydia would certainly have
continued the occupation, but unluckily no one passed windows now
except a few of the officers, who, in comparison with the
stranger, were become <div class="bookquote">"stupid, disagreeable fellows."  (<font color='red'><b>the stranger</b></font>)</div>Some of
them were to dine with the Phillipses the next day, and their
aunt promised to make her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) husband call on Mr. Wickham, and give
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) an invitation also, if the family from Longbourn would come
in the evening. This was agreed to, and Mrs. Phillips protested
that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery
tickets, and a little bit of hot supper afterwards. The prospect
of such delights was very cheering, and they parted in mutual
good spirits. Mr. Collins repeated his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) apologies in quitting the
room, and was assured with unwearying civility that they were
perfectly needless.

<p/>As they walked home, Elizabeth related to Jane what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had seen
pass between the two gentlemen; but though Jane would have
defended either or both, had they appeared to be in the wrong,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could no more explain such behaviour than her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Mr. Collins on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) return highly gratified Mrs. Bennet by
admiring Mrs. Phillips’s manners and politeness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) protested
that, except Lady Catherine and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) daughter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had never seen a
more elegant woman; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had not only received him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with the
utmost civility, but even pointedly included him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
invitation for the next evening, although utterly unknown to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
before. Something, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) supposed, might be attributed to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
connection with them, but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had never met with so much
attention in the whole course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) life.
