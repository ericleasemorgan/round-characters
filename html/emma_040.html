<p/>A very few days had passed after this adventure, when Harriet came one morning to Emma with a small parcel in her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand, and after sitting down and hesitating, thus began:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Woodhouse if you are at leisure I have something that I should like to tell you a sort of confession to make and then, you know, it will be over."

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma was a good deal surprized; but begged her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to speak. There was a seriousness in Harriet's manner which prepared her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), quite as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) words, for something more than ordinary.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is my duty, and I am sure it is my wish,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) continued, "to have no reserves with you on this subject. As I am happily quite an altered creature in one respect, it is very fit that you should have the satisfaction of knowing it. I do not want to say more than is necessary I am too much ashamed of having given way as I have done, and I dare say you understand me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "I hope I do."

<p/>"How I could so long a time be fancying myself!...<div class="bookquote">" cried Harriet, warmly. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>It seems like madness! I can see nothing at all extraordinary in him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) now. I do not care whether I meet him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) or not except that of the two I had rather not see him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) and indeed I would go any distance round to avoid him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) but I do not envy his (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) wife in the least; I neither admire her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) nor envy her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), as I have done: she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is very charming, I dare say, and all that, but I think her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) very ill-tempered and disagreeable I shall never forget her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) look the other night! However, I assure you, Miss Woodhouse, I wish her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) no evil. No, let them be ever so happy together, it will not give me another moment's pang: and to convince you that I have been speaking truth, I am now going to destroy what I ought to have destroyed long ago what I ought never to have kept I know that very well (blushing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) spoke). However, now I will destroy it all and it is my particular wish to do it in your presence, that you may see how rational I am grown. Cannot you guess what this parcel holds?" said she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), with a conscious look.

<p/>"Not the least in the world. Did he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) ever give you any thing?"

<p/>"No I cannot call them gifts; but they are things that I have valued very much."

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) held the parcel towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), and Emma read the words Most precious treasures on the top. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) curiosity was greatly excited. Harriet unfolded the parcel, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) looked on with impatience. Within abundance of silver paper was a pretty little Tunbridge-ware box, which Harriet opened: it was well lined with the softest cotton; but, excepting the cotton, Emma saw only a small piece of court-plaister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, <div class="bookquote">"you must recollect."

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"No, indeed I do not."

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>"Dear me! I should not have thought it possible you could forget what passed in this very room about court-plaister, one of the very last times we ever met in it! It was but a very few days before I had my sore throat just before Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley came I think the very evening. Do not you remember his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cutting his (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) finger with your new penknife, and your recommending court-plaister? But, as you had none about you, and knew I had, you desired me to supply him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>); and so I took mine out and cut him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) a piece; but it was a great deal too large, and he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) cut it smaller, and kept playing some time with what was left, before he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) gave it back to me. And so then, in my nonsense, I could not help making a treasure of it so I put it by never to be used, and looked at it now and then as a great treat."

<p/>"My dearest Harriet!" cried Emma, putting her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand before her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face, and jumping up, "you make me more ashamed of myself than I can bear. Remember it? Aye, I remember it all now; all, except your saving this relic I knew nothing of that till this moment but the cutting the finger, and my recommending court-plaister, and saying I had none about me! Oh! my sins, my sins! And I had plenty all the while in my pocket! One of my senseless tricks! I deserve to be under a continual blush all the rest of my life. Well (sitting down again) go on what else?"

<p/>"And had you really some at hand yourself? I am sure I never suspected it, you did it so naturally."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And so you actually put this piece of court-plaister by for his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) sake!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, recovering from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) state of shame and feeling divided between wonder and amusement. And secretly she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) added to herself, "Lord bless me! when should I ever have thought of putting by in cotton a piece of court-plaister that Frank Churchill had been pulling about! I never was equal to this."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Here,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>resumed Harriet, turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) box again, "here is something still more valuable, I mean that has been more valuable, because this is what did really once belong to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), which the court-plaister never did."

<p/>Emma was quite eager to see this superior treasure. It was the end of an old pencil, the part without any lead.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This was really his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet. "Do not you remember one morning? no, I dare say you do not. But one morning I forget exactly the day but perhaps it was the Tuesday or Wednesday before that evening, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wanted to make a memorandum in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pocket-book; it was about spruce-beer. Mr. Knightley had been telling him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) something about brewing spruce-beer, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted to put it down; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took out his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) pencil, there was so little lead that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon cut it all away, and it would not do, so you lent him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) another, and this was left upon the table as good for nothing. But I kept my eye on it; and, as soon as I dared, caught it up, and never parted with it again from that moment."

<p/>"I do remember it," cried Emma; "I perfectly remember it. Talking about spruce-beer. Oh! yes Mr. Knightley and I both saying we liked it, and Mr. Elton's seeming resolved to learn to like it too. I perfectly remember it. Stop; Mr. Knightley was standing just here, was not he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)? I have an idea he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was standing just here."

<p/>"Ah! I do not know. I cannot recollect. It is very odd, but I cannot recollect. Mr. Elton was sitting here, I remember, much about where I am now."

<p/>"Well, go on."

<p/>"Oh! that's all. I have nothing more to shew you, or to say except that I am now going to throw them both behind the fire, and I wish you to see me do it."

<p/>"My poor dear Harriet! and have you actually found happiness in treasuring up these things?"

<p/>"Yes, simpleton as I was! but I am quite ashamed of it now, and wish I could forget as easily as I can burn them. It was very wrong of me, you know, to keep any remembrances, after he (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) was married. I knew it was but had not resolution enough to part with them."

<p/>"But, Harriet, is it necessary to burn the court-plaister? I have not a word to say for the bit of old pencil, but the court-plaister might be useful."

<p/>"I shall be happier to burn it,<div class="bookquote">" replied Harriet. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>It has a disagreeable look to me. I must get rid of every thing. There it goes, and there is an end, thank Heaven! of Mr. Elton."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And when,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>thought Emma, "will there be a beginning of Mr. Churchill?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had soon afterwards reason to believe that the beginning was already made, and could not but hope that the gipsy, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had told no fortune, might be proved to have made Harriet's. About a fortnight after the alarm, they came to a sufficient explanation, and quite undesignedly. Emma was not thinking of it at the moment, which made the information she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) received more valuable. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) merely said, in the course of some trivial chat, " (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>Well, Harriet, whenever you marry I would advise you to do so and so" and thought no more of it, till after a minute's silence she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) heard Harriet say in a very serious tone, <div class="bookquote">"I shall never marry."

 (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma then looked up, and immediately saw how it was; and after a moment's debate, as to whether it should pass unnoticed or not, replied,

<p/>"Never marry! This is a new resolution."

<p/>"It is one that I shall never change, however."

<p/>After another short hesitation, "I hope it does not proceed from I hope it is not in compliment to Mr. Elton?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Harriet indignantly. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! no<div class="bookquote">" and Emma could just catch the words, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>so superior to Mr. Elton!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then took a longer time for consideration. Should she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) proceed no farther? should she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) let it pass, and seem to suspect nothing? Perhaps Harriet might think her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) cold or angry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did; or perhaps if she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) were totally silent, it might only drive Harriet into asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to hear too much; and against any thing like such an unreserve as had been, such an open and frequent discussion of hopes and chances, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was perfectly resolved. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed it would be wiser for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to say and know at once, all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) meant to say and know. Plain dealing was always best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had previously determined how far she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would proceed, on any application of the sort; and it would be safer for both, to have the judicious law of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own brain laid down with speed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was decided, and thus spoke

<p/>"Harriet, I will not affect to be in doubt of your meaning. Your resolution, or rather your expectation of never marrying, results from an idea that the person whom you might prefer, would be too greatly your superior in situation to think of you. Is not it so?"

<p/>"Oh! Miss Woodhouse, believe me I have not the presumption to suppose  Indeed I am not so mad. But it is a pleasure to me to admire him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) at a distance and to think of his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) infinite superiority to all the rest of the world, with the gratitude, wonder, and veneration, which are so proper, in me especially."

<p/>"I am not at all surprized at you, Harriet. The service he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) rendered you was enough to warm your heart."

<p/>"Service! oh! it was such an inexpressible obligation! The very recollection of it, and all that I felt at the time when I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) coming his (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) noble look and my wretchedness before. Such a change! In one moment such a change! From perfect misery to perfect happiness!"

<p/>"It is very natural. It is natural, and it is honourable. Yes, honourable, I think, to chuse so well and so gratefully. But that it will be a fortunate preference is more than I can promise. I do not advise you to give way to it, Harriet. I do not by any means engage for its being returned. Consider what you are about. Perhaps it will be wisest in you to check your feelings while you can: at any rate do not let them carry you far, unless you are persuaded of his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) liking you. Be observant of him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>). Let his (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) behaviour be the guide of your sensations. I give you this caution now, because I shall never speak to you again on the subject. I am determined against all interference. Henceforward I know nothing of the matter. Let no name ever pass our lips. We were very wrong before; we will be cautious now. He (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) is your superior, no doubt, and there do seem objections and obstacles of a very serious nature; but yet, Harriet, more wonderful things have taken place, there have been matches of greater disparity. But take care of yourself. I would not have you too sanguine; though, however it may end, be assured your raising your thoughts to him (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>), is a mark of good taste which I shall always know how to value."

<p/>Harriet kissed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hand in silent and submissive gratitude. Emma was very decided in thinking such an attachment no bad thing for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend. Its tendency would be to raise and refine her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind and it must be saving her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) from the danger of degradation.
