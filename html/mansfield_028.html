<p/>Her uncle and both her (<font color='blue'><b>Her</b></font>) aunts were in the drawing-room when Fanny went
down. To the former she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was an interesting object, and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) saw with
pleasure the general elegance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appearance, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being in
remarkably good looks. The neatness and propriety of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dress was all
that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) would allow himself to commend in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) presence, but upon her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
leaving the room again soon afterwards, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spoke of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) beauty with
very decided praise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>said Lady Bertram, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) looks very well. I sent Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)."

<p/>"Look well! Oh, yes!<div class="bookquote">" cried Mrs. Norris, " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has good reason to look
well with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) advantages: brought up in this family as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) has
been, with all the benefit of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) cousins’ manners before her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). Only
think, my dear Sir Thomas, what extraordinary advantages you and I have
been the means of giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). The very gown you have been taking notice
of is your own generous present to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) when dear Mrs. Rushworth
married. What would she (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) have been if we had not taken her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) by the hand?"

<p/>Sir Thomas said no more; but when they sat down to table the eyes of
the two young men assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that the subject might be gently touched
again, when the ladies withdrew, with more success. Fanny saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was approved; and the consciousness of looking well made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) look still
better. From a variety of causes she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was happy, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon made
still happier; for in following her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunts out of the room, Edmund, who
was holding open the door, said, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) passed him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"You must dance
with me, Fanny; you must keep two dances for me; any two that you like,
except the first."  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing more to wish for. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hardly
ever been in a state so nearly approaching high spirits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) life.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins’ former gaiety on the day of a ball was no longer
surprising to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it to be indeed very charming, and was
actually practising her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) steps about the drawing-room as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could be safe from the notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, who was entirely
taken up at first in fresh arranging and injuring the noble fire which
the butler had prepared.

<p/>Half an hour followed that would have been at least languid under any
other circumstances, but Fanny’s happiness still prevailed. It was but
to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation with Edmund, and what was the restlessness
of Mrs. Norris? What were the yawns of Lady Bertram?

<p/>The gentlemen joined them; and soon after began the sweet expectation
of a carriage, when a general spirit of ease and enjoyment seemed
diffused, and they all stood about and talked and laughed, and every
moment had its pleasure and its hope. Fanny felt that there must be a
struggle in Edmund’s cheerfulness, but it was delightful to see the
effort so successfully made.

<p/>When the carriages were really heard, when the guests began really to
assemble, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own gaiety of heart was much subdued: the sight of so
many strangers threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) back into herself; and besides the gravity and
formality of the first great circle, which the manners of neither Sir
Thomas nor Lady Bertram were of a kind to do away, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) found herself
occasionally called on to endure something worse. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was introduced
here and there by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) uncle, and forced to be spoken to, and to
curtsey, and speak again. This was a hard duty, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) was never
summoned to it without looking at William, as he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) walked about at his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
ease in the background of the scene, and longing to be with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>).

<p/>The entrance of the Grants and Crawfords was a favourable epoch. The
stiffness of the meeting soon gave way before their popular manners and
more diffused intimacies: little groups were formed, and everybody grew
comfortable. Fanny felt the advantage; and, drawing back from the toils
of civility, would have been again most happy, could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have kept her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
eyes from wandering between Edmund and Mary Crawford. _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ looked all
loveliness—and what might not be the end of it? Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own musings were
brought to an end on perceiving Mr. Crawford before her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thoughts were put into another channel by his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) engaging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) almost
instantly for the first two dances. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) happiness on this occasion was
very much _à la mortal_, finely chequered. To be secure of a partner at
first was a most essential good—for the moment of beginning was now
growing seriously near; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) so little understood her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own claims as
to think that if Mr. Crawford had not asked her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must have been the
last to be sought after, and should have received a partner only
through a series of inquiry, and bustle, and interference, which would
have been terrible; but at the same time there was a pointedness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
manner of asking her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not like, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) eye
glancing for a moment at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) necklace, with a smile—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought there
was a smile—which made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) blush and feel wretched. And though there
was no second glance to disturb her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), though his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) object seemed then to
be only quietly agreeable, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not get the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
embarrassment, heightened as it was by the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) perceiving it,
and had no composure till he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) turned away to some one else. Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could gradually rise up to the genuine satisfaction of having a
partner, a voluntary partner, secured against the dancing began.

<p/>When the company were moving into the ballroom, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found herself for
the first time near Miss Crawford, whose eyes and smiles were
immediately and more unequivocally directed as her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) brother’s had been,
and who was beginning to speak on the subject, when Fanny, anxious to
get the story over, hastened to give the explanation of the second
necklace: the real chain. Miss Crawford listened; and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intended
compliments and insinuations to Fanny were forgotten: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt only one
thing; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes, bright as they had been before, shewing they could
yet be brighter, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) exclaimed with eager pleasure, "Did he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)? Did
Edmund? That was like himself. No other man would have thought of it. I
honour him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) beyond expression." And she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) looked around as if longing to
tell him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was not near, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was attending a party of ladies out of
the room; and Mrs. Grant coming up to the two girls, and taking an arm
of each, they followed with the rest.

<p/>Fanny’s heart sunk, but there was no leisure for thinking long even of
Miss Crawford’s feelings. They were in the ballroom, the violins were
playing, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was in a flutter that forbade its fixing on
anything serious. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must watch the general arrangements, and see how
everything was done.

<p/>In a few minutes Sir Thomas came to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were engaged;
and the <div class="bookquote">"Yes, sir; to Mr. Crawford,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had intended
to hear. Mr. Crawford was not far off; Sir Thomas brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>),
saying something which discovered to Fanny, that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)_ was to lead the
way and open the ball; an idea that had never occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) before.
Whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had thought of the minutiae of the evening, it had been as
a matter of course that Edmund would begin with Miss Crawford; and the
impression was so strong, that though _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ _uncle_ spoke the contrary,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could not help an exclamation of surprise, a hint of her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) unfitness,
an entreaty even to be excused. To be urging her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) opinion against Sir
Thomas’s was a proof of the extremity of the case; but such was her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
horror at the first suggestion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could actually look him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) in the
face and say that she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped it might be settled otherwise; in vain,
however: Sir Thomas smiled, tried to encourage her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and then looked too
serious, and said too decidedly, <div class="bookquote">"It must be so, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to
hazard another word; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) found herself the next moment conducted by
Mr. Crawford to the top of the room, and standing there to be joined by
the rest of the dancers, couple after couple, as they were formed.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) could hardly believe it. To be placed above so many elegant young
women! The distinction was too great. It was treating her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) like her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
cousins! And her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) thoughts flew to those absent cousins with most
unfeigned and truly tender regret, that they were not at home to take
their own place in the room, and have their share of a pleasure which
would have been so very delightful to them. So often as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had heard
them wish for a ball at home as the greatest of all felicities! And to
have them away when it was given—and for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ to be opening the
ball—and with Mr. Crawford too! She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped they would not envy her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that
distinction _now_; but when she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) looked back to the state of things in
the autumn, to what they had all been to each other when once dancing
in that house before, the present arrangement was almost more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
could understand herself.

<p/>The ball began. It was rather honour than happiness to Fanny, for the
first dance at least: her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) partner was in excellent spirits, and tried
to impart them to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>); but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was a great deal too much frightened to
have any enjoyment till she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could suppose herself no longer looked at.
Young, pretty, and gentle, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no awkwardnesses that were
not as good as graces, and there were few persons present that were not
disposed to praise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was attractive, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was modest, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was Sir
Thomas’s niece, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was soon said to be admired by Mr. Crawford. It
was enough to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) general favour. Sir Thomas himself was watching
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) progress down the dance with much complacency; he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was proud of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
niece; and without attributing all her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) personal beauty, as Mrs. Norris
seemed to do, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) transplantation to Mansfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was pleased with
himself for having supplied everything else: education and manners she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
owed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>).

<p/>Miss Crawford saw much of Sir Thomas’s thoughts as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) stood, and
having, in spite of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) wrongs towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), a general prevailing
desire of recommending herself to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), took an opportunity of stepping
aside to say something agreeable of Fanny. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) praise was warm, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
received it as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could wish, joining in it as far as discretion, and
politeness, and slowness of speech would allow, and certainly appearing
to greater advantage on the subject than his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) lady did soon afterwards,
when Mary, perceiving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on a sofa very near, turned round before she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
began to dance, to compliment her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) on Miss Price’s looks.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) does look very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Bertram</b></font>)</div>was Lady Bertram’s placid reply.
"Chapman helped her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) to dress. I sent Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)." Not but that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)
was really pleased to have Fanny admired; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so much more
struck with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own kindness in sending Chapman to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not get it out of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) head.

<p/>Miss Crawford knew Mrs. Norris too well to think of gratifying _her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ by
commendation of Fanny; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), it was as the occasion offered—"Ah!
ma’am, how much we want dear Mrs. Rushworth and Julia to-night!<div class="bookquote">" and
Mrs. Norris paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) with as many smiles and courteous words as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had
time for, amid so much occupation as she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) found for herself in making up
card-tables, giving hints to Sir Thomas, and trying to move all the
chaperons to a better part of the room.

<p/>Miss Crawford blundered most towards Fanny herself in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) intentions to
please. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) little heart a happy flutter, and
filling her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with sensations of delightful self-consequence; and,
misinterpreting Fanny’s blushes, still thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must be doing so
when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) after the two first dances, and said, with a
significant look, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Perhaps _you_ can tell me why my brother goes to
town to-morrow? He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) has business there, but will not tell me
what. The first time he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) ever denied me his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) confidence! But this is what
we all come to. All are supplanted sooner or later. Now, I must apply
to you for information. Pray, what is Henry going for?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny protested her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ignorance as steadily as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) embarrassment allowed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>Well, then," replied Miss Crawford, laughing, "I must suppose it to be
purely for the pleasure of conveying your brother, and of talking of
you by the way."

<p/>Fanny was confused, but it was the confusion of discontent; while Miss
Crawford wondered she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) did not smile, and thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) over-anxious, or
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) odd, or thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) anything rather than insensible of
pleasure in Henry’s attentions. Fanny had a good deal of enjoyment in
the course of the evening; but Henry’s attentions had very little to do
with it. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would much rather _not_ have been asked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) again so
very soon, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not been obliged to suspect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
previous inquiries of Mrs. Norris, about the supper hour, were all for
the sake of securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) at that part of the evening. But it was not to
be avoided: he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) made her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) feel that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was the object of all; though she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
could not say that it was unpleasantly done, that there was indelicacy
or ostentation in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) manner; and sometimes, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) talked of William,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was really not unagreeable, and shewed even a warmth of heart which
did him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) credit. But still his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) attentions made no part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
satisfaction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) looked at William, and saw how
perfectly he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was enjoying himself, in every five minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) could
walk about with him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) and hear his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) account of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) partners; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy
in knowing herself admired; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy in having the two dances
with Edmund still to look forward to, during the greatest part of the
evening, her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) hand being so eagerly sought after that her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) indefinite
engagement with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_ was in continual perspective. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was happy even
when they did take place; but not from any flow of spirits on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) side,
or any such expressions of tender gallantry as had blessed the morning.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mind was fagged, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) happiness sprung from being the friend
with whom it could find repose. <div class="bookquote">"I am worn out with civility,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>).
"I have been talking incessantly all night, and with nothing to say.
But with _you_, Fanny, there may be peace. You will not want to be
talked to. Let us have the luxury of silence." Fanny would hardly even
speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) agreement. A weariness, arising probably, in great measure,
from the same feelings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had acknowledged in the morning, was
peculiarly to be respected, and they went down their two dances
together with such sober tranquillity as might satisfy any looker-on
that Sir Thomas had been bringing up no wife for his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) younger son.

<p/>The evening had afforded Edmund little pleasure. Miss Crawford had been
in gay spirits when they first danced together, but it was not her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
gaiety that could do him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) good: it rather sank than raised his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) comfort;
and afterwards, for he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) found himself still impelled to seek her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) again,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had absolutely pained him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) manner of speaking of the
profession to which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was now on the point of belonging. They had
talked, and they had been silent; he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had reasoned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had ridiculed;
and they had parted at last with mutual vexation. Fanny, not able to
refrain entirely from observing them, had seen enough to be tolerably
satisfied. It was barbarous to be happy when Edmund was suffering. Yet
some happiness must and would arise from the very conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
did suffer.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two dances with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) were over, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) inclination and strength
for more were pretty well at an end; and Sir Thomas, having seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
walk rather than dance down the shortening set, breathless, and with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) hand at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) side, gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) orders for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sitting down entirely.
From that time Mr. Crawford sat down likewise.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor Fanny!"  (<font color='red'><b>William</b></font>)</div>cried William, coming for a moment to visit her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and
working away his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) partner’s fan as if for life, "how soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) is knocked
up! Why, the sport is but just begun. I hope we shall keep it up these
two hours. How can you be tired so soon?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So soon! my good friend,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, producing his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) watch with
all necessary caution; "it is three o’clock, and your sister is not
used to these sort of hours."

<p/>"Well, then, Fanny, you shall not get up to-morrow before I go. Sleep
as long as you can, and never mind me."

<p/>"Oh! William."

<p/>"What! Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) think of being up before you set off?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! yes, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, rising eagerly from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) seat to be nearer
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle; "I must get up and breakfast with him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). It will be the last
time, you know; the last morning."

<p/>"You had better not. He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) is to have breakfasted and be gone by half-past
nine. Mr. Crawford, I think you call for him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at half-past nine?"

<p/>Fanny was too urgent, however, and had too many tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes for
denial; and it ended in a gracious "Well, well!<div class="bookquote">" which was permission.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford/Crawford</b></font>)</div>Yes, half-past nine," said Crawford to William as the latter was
leaving them, "and I shall be punctual, for there will be no kind
sister to get up for _me_." And in a lower tone to Fanny, "I shall have
only a desolate house to hurry from. Your brother will find my ideas of
time and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own very different to-morrow."

<p/>After a short consideration, Sir Thomas asked Crawford to join the
early breakfast party in that house instead of eating alone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) should
himself be of it; and the readiness with which his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) invitation was
accepted convinced him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that the suspicions whence, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must confess to
himself, this very ball had in great measure sprung, were well founded.
Mr. Crawford was in love with Fanny. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had a pleasing anticipation of
what would be. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) niece, meanwhile, did not thank him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) for what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had
just done. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had hoped to have William all to herself the last
morning. It would have been an unspeakable indulgence. But though her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
wishes were overthrown, there was no spirit of murmuring within her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). On
the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was so totally unused to have her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) pleasure consulted,
or to have anything take place at all in the way she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) could desire, that
she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was more disposed to wonder and rejoice in having carried her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) point
so far, than to repine at the counteraction which followed.

<p/>Shortly afterward, Sir Thomas was again interfering a little with her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
inclination, by advising her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) to go immediately to bed. <div class="bookquote">"Advise"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
word, but it was the advice of absolute power, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had only to
rise, and, with Mr. Crawford’s very cordial adieus, pass quietly away;
stopping at the entrance-door, like the Lady of Branxholm Hall, "one
moment and no more," to view the happy scene, and take a last look at
the five or six determined couple who were still hard at work; and
then, creeping slowly up the principal staircase, pursued by the
ceaseless country-dance, feverish with hopes and fears, soup and negus,
sore-footed and fatigued, restless and agitated, yet feeling, in spite
of everything, that a ball was indeed delightful.

<p/>In thus sending her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) away, Sir Thomas perhaps might not be thinking
merely of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) health. It might occur to him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) that Mr. Crawford had been
sitting by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) long enough, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) might mean to recommend her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) as a wife
by shewing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) persuadableness.
