<p/>Nothing occurred during the next three or four days, to make Elinor
regret what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had done, in applying to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother; for Willoughby
neither came nor wrote. They were engaged about the end of that time to
attend Lady Middleton to a party, from which Mrs. Jennings was kept
away by the indisposition of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) youngest daughter; and for this party,
Marianne, wholly dispirited, careless of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) appearance, and seeming
equally indifferent whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) went or staid, prepared, without one
look of hope or one expression of pleasure. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat by the drawing-room
fire after tea, till the moment of Lady Middleton’s arrival, without
once stirring from her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) seat, or altering her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) attitude, lost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) own
thoughts, and insensible of her (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) sister’s presence; and when at last
they were told that Lady Middleton waited for them at the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>)
started as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Middleton</b></font>) had forgotten that any one was expected.

<p/>They arrived in due time at the place of destination, and as soon as
the string of carriages before them would allow, alighted, ascended the
stairs, heard their names announced from one landing-place to another
in an audible voice, and entered a room splendidly lit up, quite full
of company, and insufferably hot. When they had paid their tribute of
politeness by curtsying to the lady of the house, they were permitted
to mingle in the crowd, and take their share of the heat and
inconvenience, to which their arrival must necessarily add. After some
time spent in saying little or doing less, Lady Middleton sat down to
Cassino, and as Marianne was not in spirits for moving about, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) and
Elinor luckily succeeding to chairs, placed themselves at no great
distance from the table.

<p/>They had not remained in this manner long, before Elinor perceived
Willoughby, standing within a few yards of them, in earnest
conversation with a very fashionable looking young woman. She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) soon
caught his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eye, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) immediately bowed, but without attempting to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>), or to approach Marianne, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not but see her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and then continued his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) discourse with the same lady. Elinor turned
involuntarily to Marianne, to see whether it could be unobserved by
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). At that moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first perceived him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) whole countenance
glowing with sudden delight, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) would have moved towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly, had not her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister caught hold of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Good heavens!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exclaimed, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is there—he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) is there—Oh! why does he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
not look at me? why cannot I speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Pray, pray be composed,<div class="bookquote">" cried Elinor, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>and do not betray what you
feel to every body present. Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) has not observed you yet.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This however was more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could believe herself; and to be
composed at such a moment was not only beyond the reach of Marianne, it
was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sat in an agony of impatience which affected
every feature.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) turned round again, and regarded them both; she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) started up,
and pronouncing his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) name in a tone of affection, held out her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) hand to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) approached, and addressing himself rather to Elinor than
Marianne, as if wishing to avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eye, and determined not to observe
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) attitude, inquired in a hurried manner after Mrs. Dashwood, and
asked how long they had been in town. Elinor was robbed of all presence
of mind by such an address, and was unable to say a word. But the
feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister were instantly expressed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) face was crimsoned
over, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) exclaimed, in a voice of the greatest emotion, " (<font color='red'><b>God</b></font>)</div>Good God!
Willoughby, what is the meaning of this? Have you not received my
letters? Will you not shake hands with me?"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) could not then avoid it, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) touch seemed painful to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
held her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand only for a moment. During all this time he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was evidently
struggling for composure. Elinor watched his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) countenance and saw its
expression becoming more tranquil. After a moment’s pause, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) spoke
with calmness.

<p/>"I did myself the honour of calling in Berkeley Street last Tuesday,
and very much regretted that I was not fortunate enough to find
yourselves and Mrs. Jennings at home. My card was not lost, I hope."

<p/>"But have you not received my notes?<div class="bookquote">" cried Marianne in the wildest
anxiety. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Here is some mistake I am sure—some dreadful mistake. What
can be the meaning of it? Tell me, Willoughby; for heaven’s sake tell
me, what is the matter?"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) made no reply; his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) complexion changed and all his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) embarrassment
returned; but as if, on catching the eye of the young lady with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
had been previously talking, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) felt the necessity of instant exertion,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) recovered himself again, and after saying, "Yes, I had the pleasure
of receiving the information of your arrival in town, which you were so
good as to send me," turned hastily away with a slight bow and joined
his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Marianne, now looking dreadfully white, and unable to stand, sunk into
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) chair, and Elinor, expecting every moment to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) faint, tried
to screen her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) from the observation of others, while reviving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) with
lavender water.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>), Elinor,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) cried, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) could speak, "and force
him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to come to me. Tell him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) I must see him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again—must speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
instantly.—I cannot rest—I shall not have a moment’s peace till this is
explained—some dreadful misapprehension or other. Oh, go to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) this
moment."

<p/>"How can that be done? No, my dearest Marianne, you must wait. This is
not the place for explanations. Wait only till tomorrow."

<p/>With difficulty however could she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) prevent her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from following him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>)
herself; and to persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to check her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) agitation, to wait, at least,
with the appearance of composure, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) might speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) with more
privacy and more effect, was impossible; for Marianne continued
incessantly to give way in a low voice to the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feelings,
by exclamations of wretchedness. In a short time Elinor saw Willoughby
quit the room by the door towards the staircase, and telling Marianne
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) was gone, urged the impossibility of speaking to him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) again that
evening, as a fresh argument for her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) to be calm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) instantly begged
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister would entreat Lady Middleton to take them home, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was
too miserable to stay a minute longer.

<p/>Lady Middleton, though in the middle of a rubber, on being informed
that Marianne was unwell, was too polite to object for a moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
wish of going away, and making over her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) cards to a friend, they
departed as soon as the carriage could be found. Scarcely a word was
spoken during their return to Berkeley Street. Marianne was in a silent
agony, too much oppressed even for tears; but as Mrs. Jennings was
luckily not come home, they could go directly to their own room, where
hartshorn restored her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) a little to herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was soon undressed and
in bed, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) seemed desirous of being alone, her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sister then left
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>), and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) waited the return of Mrs. Jennings, had leisure
enough for thinking over the past.

<p/>That some kind of engagement had subsisted between Willoughby and
Marianne she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not doubt, and that Willoughby was weary of it,
seemed equally clear; for however Marianne might still feed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own
wishes, _she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)_ could not attribute such behaviour to mistake or
misapprehension of any kind. Nothing but a thorough change of sentiment
could account for it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) indignation would have been still stronger
than it was, had she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) not witnessed that embarrassment which seemed to
speak a consciousness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) own misconduct, and prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) from
believing him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) so unprincipled as to have been sporting with the
affections of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister from the first, without any design that would
bear investigation. Absence might have weakened his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) regard, and
convenience might have determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) to overcome it, but that such a
regard had formerly existed she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not bring herself to doubt.

<p/>As for Marianne, on the pangs which so unhappy a meeting must already
have given her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), and on those still more severe which might await her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) in
its probable consequence, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could not reflect without the deepest
concern. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own situation gained in the comparison; for while she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
could _esteem_ Edward as much as ever, however they might be divided in
future, her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mind might be always supported. But every circumstance that
could embitter such an evil seemed uniting to heighten the misery of
Marianne in a final separation from Willoughby—in an immediate and
irreconcilable rupture with him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>).
