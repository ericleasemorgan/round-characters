<p/>Fanny’s consequence increased on the departure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins.
Becoming, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) then did, the only young woman in the drawing-room,
the only occupier of that interesting division of a family in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
had hitherto held so humble a third, it was impossible for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) not to
be more looked at, more thought of and attended to, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had ever
been before; and <div class="bookquote">"Where is Fanny?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>became no uncommon question, even
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being wanted for any one’s convenience.

<p/>Not only at home did her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) value increase, but at the Parsonage too. In
that house, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hardly entered twice a year since Mr.
Norris’s death, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) became a welcome, an invited guest, and in the
gloom and dirt of a November day, most acceptable to Mary Crawford. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
visits there, beginning by chance, were continued by solicitation. Mrs.
Grant, really eager to get any change for her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) sister, could, by the
easiest self-deceit, persuade herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) was doing the kindest
thing by Fanny, and giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) the most important opportunities of
improvement in pressing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) frequent calls.

<p/>Fanny, having been sent into the village on some errand by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Norris, was overtaken by a heavy shower close to the Parsonage; and
being descried from one of the windows endeavouring to find shelter
under the branches and lingering leaves of an oak just beyond their
premises, was forced, though not without some modest reluctance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
part, to come in. A civil servant she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had withstood; but when Dr. Grant
himself went out with an umbrella, there was nothing to be done but to
be very much ashamed, and to get into the house as fast as possible;
and to poor Miss Crawford, who had just been contemplating the dismal
rain in a very desponding state of mind, sighing over the ruin of all
her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) plan of exercise for that morning, and of every chance of seeing a
single creature beyond themselves for the next twenty-four hours, the
sound of a little bustle at the front door, and the sight of Miss Price
dripping with wet in the vestibule, was delightful. The value of an
event on a wet day in the country was most forcibly brought before her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>).
She (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) was all alive again directly, and among the most active in being
useful to Fanny, in detecting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be wetter than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would at first
allow, and providing her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with dry clothes; and Fanny, after being
obliged to submit to all this attention, and to being assisted and
waited on by mistresses and maids, being also obliged, on returning
downstairs, to be fixed in their drawing-room for an hour while the
rain continued, the blessing of something fresh to see and think of was
thus extended to Miss Crawford, and might carry on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spirits to the
period of dressing and dinner.

<p/>The two sisters were so kind to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), and so pleasant, that Fanny might
have enjoyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) visit could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have believed herself not in the way,
and could she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) have foreseen that the weather would certainly clear at
the end of the hour, and save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) from the shame of having Dr. Grant’s
carriage and horses out to take her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) home, with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
threatened. As to anxiety for any alarm that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) absence in such
weather might occasion at home, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nothing to suffer on that
score; for as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) being out was known only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) two aunts, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was
perfectly aware that none would be felt, and that in whatever cottage
aunt Norris might chuse to establish her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) during the rain, her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) being in
such cottage would be indubitable to aunt Bertram.

<p/>It was beginning to look brighter, when Fanny, observing a harp in the
room, asked some questions about it, which soon led to an
acknowledgment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wishing very much to hear it, and a confession,
which could hardly be believed, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having never yet heard it since
its being in Mansfield. To Fanny herself it appeared a very simple and
natural circumstance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had scarcely ever been at the Parsonage since
the instrument’s arrival, there had been no reason that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should; but
Miss Crawford, calling to mind an early expressed wish on the subject,
was concerned at her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) own neglect; and <div class="bookquote">"Shall I play to you now?"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>and
<div class="bookquote">"What will you have?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>were questions immediately following with the
readiest good-humour.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) played accordingly; happy to have a new listener, and a listener
who seemed so much obliged, so full of wonder at the performance, and
who shewed herself not wanting in taste. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) played till Fanny’s eyes,
straying to the window on the weather’s being evidently fair, spoke
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt must be done.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Another quarter of an hour,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, "and we shall see how
it will be. Do not run away the first moment of its holding up. Those
clouds look alarming."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But they are passed over,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny. "I have been watching them.
This weather is all from the south."

<p/>"South or north, I know a black cloud when I see it; and you must not
set forward while it is so threatening. And besides, I want to play
something more to you—a very pretty piece—and your cousin Edmund’s
prime favourite. You must stay and hear your cousin’s favourite.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Fanny felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had not waited for that
sentence to be thinking of Edmund, such a memento made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) particularly
awake to his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) idea, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fancied him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) sitting in that room again and
again, perhaps in the very spot where she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) sat now, listening with
constant delight to the favourite air, played, as it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
with superior tone and expression; and though pleased with it herself,
and glad to like whatever was liked by him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was more sincerely
impatient to go away at the conclusion of it than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been before;
and on this being evident, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was so kindly asked to call again, to
take them in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could, to come and hear more of the
harp, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt it necessary to be done, if no objection arose at
home.

<p/>Such was the origin of the sort of intimacy which took place between
them within the first fortnight after the Miss Bertrams’  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>going away—an
intimacy resulting principally from Miss Crawford’s desire of something
new, and which had little reality in Fanny’s feelings. Fanny went to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) every two or three days: it seemed a kind of fascination: she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not be easy without going, and yet it was without loving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), without
ever thinking like her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), without any sense of obligation for being
sought after now when nobody else was to be had; and deriving no higher
pleasure from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) conversation than occasional amusement, and _that_
often at the expense of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment, when it was raised by pleasantry
on people or subjects which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wished to be respected. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) went,
however, and they sauntered about together many an half-hour in Mrs.
Grant’s shrubbery, the weather being unusually mild for the time of
year, and venturing sometimes even to sit down on one of the benches
now comparatively unsheltered, remaining there perhaps till, in the
midst of some tender ejaculation of Fanny’s on the sweets of so
protracted an autumn, they were forced, by the sudden swell of a cold
gust shaking down the last few yellow leaves about them, to jump up and
walk for warmth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is pretty, very pretty,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, looking around her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) as they
were thus sitting together one day; "every time I come into this
shrubbery I am more struck with its growth and beauty. Three years ago,
this was nothing but a rough hedgerow along the upper side of the
field, never thought of as anything, or capable of becoming anything;
and now it is converted into a walk, and it would be difficult to say
whether most valuable as a convenience or an ornament; and perhaps, in
another three years, we may be forgetting—almost forgetting what it was
before. How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and
the changes of the human mind!" And following the latter train of
thought, she (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) soon afterwards added: "If any one faculty of our nature
may be called _more_ wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory.
There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers,
the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our
intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so
obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so
tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way;
but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly
past finding out.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Crawford, untouched and inattentive, had nothing to say; and
Fanny, perceiving it, brought back her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own mind to what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought
must interest.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>It may seem impertinent in _me_ to praise, but I must admire the taste
Mrs. Grant has shewn in all this. There is such a quiet simplicity in
the plan of the walk! Not too much attempted!"

<p/>"Yes,<div class="bookquote">" replied Miss Crawford carelessly, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>it does very well for a place
of this sort. One does not think of extent _here_; and between
ourselves, till I came to Mansfield, I had not imagined a country
parson ever aspired to a shrubbery, or anything of the kind."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am so glad to see the evergreens thrive!"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in reply. "My
uncle’s gardener always says the soil here is better than his (<font color='blue'><b>gardener</b></font>) own, and
so it appears from the growth of the laurels and evergreens in general.
The evergreen! How beautiful, how welcome, how wonderful the evergreen!
When one thinks of it, how astonishing a variety of nature! In some
countries we know the tree that sheds its leaf is the variety, but that
does not make it less amazing that the same soil and the same sun
should nurture plants differing in the first rule and law of their
existence. You will think me rhapsodising; but when I am out of doors,
especially when I am sitting out of doors, I am very apt to get into
this sort of wondering strain. One cannot fix one’s eyes on the
commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling
fancy."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To say the truth,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>replied Miss Crawford, "I am something like the
famous Doge at the court of Lewis XIV.; and may declare that I see no
wonder in this shrubbery equal to seeing myself in it. If anybody had
told me a year ago that this place would be my home, that I should be
spending month after month here, as I have done, I certainly should not
have believed them. I have now been here nearly five months; and,
moreover, the quietest five months I ever passed."

<p/>"_Too_ quiet for you, I believe."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should have thought so _theoretically_ myself, but,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and her (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) eyes
brightened as she (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) spoke, <div class="bookquote">"take it all and all, I never spent so happy a
summer. But then,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>with a more thoughtful air and lowered voice, "there
is no saying what it may lead to."

<p/>Fanny’s heart beat quick, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt quite unequal to surmising or
soliciting anything more. Miss Crawford, however, with renewed
animation, soon went on—

<p/>"I am conscious of being far better reconciled to a country residence
than I had ever expected to be. I can even suppose it pleasant to spend
_half_ the year in the country, under certain circumstances, very
pleasant. An elegant, moderate-sized house in the centre of family
connexions; continual engagements among them; commanding the first
society in the neighbourhood; looked up to, perhaps, as leading it even
more than those of larger fortune, and turning from the cheerful round
of such amusements to nothing worse than a _tête-à-tête_ with the
person one feels most agreeable in the world. There is nothing
frightful in such a picture, is there, Miss Price? One need not envy
the new Mrs. Rushworth with such a home as _that_."

<p/>"Envy Mrs. Rushworth!<div class="bookquote">" was all that Fanny attempted to say. " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Rushworth</b></font>)</div>Come,
come, it would be very un-handsome in us to be severe on Mrs.
Rushworth, for I look forward to our owing her (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) a great many gay,
brilliant, happy hours. I expect we shall be all very much at Sotherton
another year. Such a match as Miss Bertram has made is a public
blessing; for the first pleasures of Mr. Rushworth’s wife must be to
fill her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) house, and give the best balls in the country."

<p/>Fanny was silent, and Miss Crawford relapsed into thoughtfulness, till
suddenly looking up at the end of a few minutes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exclaimed, "Ah!
here he (<font color='blue'><b>Rushworth</b></font>) is.<div class="bookquote">" It was not Mr. Rushworth, however, but Edmund, who then
appeared walking towards them with Mrs. Grant. " (<font color='red'><b>sister Bertram</b></font>)</div>My sister and Mr.
Bertram. I am so glad your eldest cousin is gone, that he (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) may be Mr.
Bertram again. There is something in the sound of Mr. _Edmund_ Bertram
so formal, so pitiful, so younger-brother-like, that I detest it."

<p/>"How differently we feel!<div class="bookquote">" cried Fanny. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>To me, the sound of _Mr._
Bertram is so cold and nothing-meaning, so entirely without warmth or
character! It just stands for a gentleman, and that’s all. But there is
nobleness in the name of Edmund. It is a name of heroism and renown; of
kings, princes, and knights; and seems to breathe the spirit of
chivalry and warm affections."

<p/>"I grant you the name is good in itself, and _Lord_ Edmund or _Sir_
Edmund sound delightfully; but sink it under the chill, the
annihilation of a Mr., and Mr. Edmund is no more than Mr. John or Mr.
Thomas. Well, shall we join and disappoint them of half their lecture
upon sitting down out of doors at this time of year, by being up before
they can begin?"

<p/>Edmund met them with particular pleasure. It was the first time of his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
seeing them together since the beginning of that better acquaintance
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had been hearing of with great satisfaction. A friendship
between two so very dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) was exactly what he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) could have wished:
and to the credit of the lover’s understanding, be it stated, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
did not by any means consider Fanny as the only, or even as the greater
gainer by such a friendship.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford, "and do you not scold us for our
imprudence? What do you think we have been sitting down for but to be
talked to about it, and entreated and supplicated never to do so
again?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps I might have scolded,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, "if either of you had been
sitting down alone; but while you do wrong together, I can overlook a
great deal."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They cannot have been sitting long,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Grant, "for when I
went up for my shawl I saw them from the staircase window, and then
they were walking."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And really,"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>added Edmund, "the day is so mild, that your sitting down
for a few minutes can be hardly thought imprudent. Our weather must not
always be judged by the calendar. We may sometimes take greater
liberties in November than in May."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Crawford, "you are two of the most
disappointing and unfeeling kind friends I ever met with! There is no
giving you a moment’s uneasiness. You do not know how much we have been
suffering, nor what chills we have felt! But I have long thought Mr.
Bertram one of the worst subjects to work on, in any little manoeuvre
against common sense, that a woman could be plagued with. I had very
little hope of _him (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>)_ from the first; but you, Mrs. Grant, my sister, my
own sister, I think I had a right to alarm you a little."

<p/>"Do not flatter yourself, my dearest Mary. You have not the smallest
chance of moving me. I have my alarms, but they are quite in a
different quarter; and if I could have altered the weather, you would
have had a good sharp east wind blowing on you the whole time—for here
are some of my plants which Robert _will_ leave out because the nights
are so mild, and I know the end of it will be, that we shall have a
sudden change of weather, a hard frost setting in all at once, taking
everybody (at least Robert) by surprise, and I shall lose every one;
and what is worse, cook has just been telling me that the turkey, which
I particularly wished not to be dressed till Sunday, because I know how
much more Dr. Grant would enjoy it on Sunday after the fatigues of the
day, will not keep beyond to-morrow. These are something like
grievances, and make me think the weather most unseasonably close."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The sweets of housekeeping in a country village!"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Crawford</b></font>)</div>said Miss Crawford
archly. "Commend me to the nurseryman and the poulterer."

<p/>"My dear child, commend Dr. Grant to the deanery of Westminster or St.
Paul’s, and I should be as glad of your nurseryman and poulterer as you
could be. But we have no such people in Mansfield. What would you have
me do?"

<p/>"Oh! you can do nothing but what you do already: be plagued very often,
and never lose your temper."

<p/>"Thank you; but there is no escaping these little vexations, Mary, live
where we may; and when you are settled in town and I come to see you, I
dare say I shall find you with yours, in spite of the nurseryman and
the poulterer, perhaps on their very account. Their remoteness and
unpunctuality, or their exorbitant charges and frauds, will be drawing
forth bitter lamentations."

<p/>"I mean to be too rich to lament or to feel anything of the sort. A
large income is the best recipe for happiness I ever heard of. It
certainly may secure all the myrtle and turkey part of it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You intend to be very rich?"  (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>said Edmund, with a look which, to
Fanny’s eye, had a great deal of serious meaning.

<p/>"To be sure. Do not you? Do not we all?"

<p/>"I cannot intend anything which it must be so completely beyond my
power to command. Miss Crawford may chuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) degree of wealth. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has
only to fix on her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) number of thousands a year, and there can be no
doubt of their coming. My intentions are only not to be poor."

<p/>"By moderation and economy, and bringing down your wants to your
income, and all that. I understand you—and a very proper plan it is for
a person at your time of life, with such limited means and indifferent
connexions. What can _you_ want but a decent maintenance? You have not
much time before you; and your relations are in no situation to do
anything for you, or to mortify you by the contrast of their own wealth
and consequence. Be honest and poor, by all means—but I shall not envy
you; I do not much think I shall even respect you. I have a much
greater respect for those that are honest and rich."

<p/>"Your degree of respect for honesty, rich or poor, is precisely what I
have no manner of concern with. I do not mean to be poor. Poverty is
exactly what I have determined against. Honesty, in the something
between, in the middle state of worldly circumstances, is all that I am
anxious for your not looking down on."

<p/>"But I do look down upon it, if it might have been higher. I must look
down upon anything contented with obscurity when it might rise to
distinction."

<p/>"But how may it rise? How may my honesty at least rise to any
distinction?"

<p/>This was not so very easy a question to answer, and occasioned an "Oh!"
of some length from the fair lady before she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could add, "You ought to
be in parliament, or you should have gone into the army ten years ago."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"_That_ is not much to the purpose now; and as to my being in
parliament, I believe I must wait till there is an especial assembly
for the representation of younger sons who have little to live on. No,
Miss Crawford,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) added, in a more serious tone, "there _are_
distinctions which I should be miserable if I thought myself without
any chance—absolutely without chance or possibility of obtaining—but
they are of a different character."

<p/>A look of consciousness as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) spoke, and what seemed a consciousness of
manner on Miss Crawford’s side as she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) made some laughing answer, was
sorrowfull food for Fanny’s observation; and finding herself quite
unable to attend as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ought to Mrs. Grant, by whose side she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was now
following the others, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had nearly resolved on going home
immediately, and only waited for courage to say so, when the sound of
the great clock at Mansfield Park, striking three, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) feel that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had really been much longer absent than usual, and brought the
previous self-inquiry of whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) should take leave or not just
then, and how, to a very speedy issue. With undoubting decision she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
directly began her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) adieus; and Edmund began at the same time to
recollect that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother had been inquiring for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) had
walked down to the Parsonage on purpose to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) back.

<p/>Fanny’s hurry increased; and without in the least expecting Edmund’s
attendance, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would have hastened away alone; but the general pace
was quickened, and they all accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) into the house, through
which it was necessary to pass. Dr. Grant was in the vestibule, and as
they stopt to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) found, from Edmund’s manner, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
_did_ mean to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) too was taking leave. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not but
be thankful. In the moment of parting, Edmund was invited by Dr. Grant
to eat his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mutton with him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) the next day; and Fanny had barely time for
an unpleasant feeling on the occasion, when Mrs. Grant, with sudden
recollection, turned to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) and asked for the pleasure of her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>) company
too. This was so new an attention, so perfectly new a circumstance in
the events of Fanny’s life, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was all surprise and
embarrassment; and while stammering out her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) great obligation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
<div class="bookquote">"but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did not suppose it would be in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) power,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>was looking at
Edmund for his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) opinion and help. But Edmund, delighted with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) having
such an happiness offered, and ascertaining with half a look, and half
a sentence, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had no objection but on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt’s account, could
not imagine that his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) mother would make any difficulty of sparing her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>),
and therefore gave his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) decided open advice that the invitation should
be accepted; and though Fanny would not venture, even on his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
encouragement, to such a flight of audacious independence, it was soon
settled, that if nothing were heard to the contrary, Mrs. Grant might
expect her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And you know what your dinner will be,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Grant, smiling—<div class="bookquote">"the
turkey, and I assure you a very fine one; for, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Grant</b></font>)</div>turning to her (<font color='blue'><b>Grant</b></font>)
husband, <div class="bookquote">"cook insists upon the turkey’s being dressed to-morrow."

 (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Very well, very well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Dr. Grant</b></font>)</div>cried Dr. Grant, "all the better; I am glad to
hear you have anything so good in the house. But Miss Price and Mr.
Edmund Bertram, I dare say, would take their chance. We none of us want
to hear the bill of fare. A friendly meeting, and not a fine dinner, is
all we have in view. A turkey, or a goose, or a leg of mutton, or
whatever you and your cook chuse to give us."

<p/>The two cousins walked home together; and, except in the immediate
discussion of this engagement, which Edmund spoke of with the warmest
satisfaction, as so particularly desirable for her (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) in the intimacy
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) saw with so much pleasure established, it was a silent walk;
