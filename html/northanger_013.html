<p/>"Mrs. Allen," said Catherine the next morning, "will there be any harm
in my calling on Miss Tilney today? I shall not be easy till I have
explained everything."

<p/>"Go, by all means, my dear; only put on a white gown; Miss Tilney
always wears white."

<p/>Catherine cheerfully complied, and being properly equipped, was more
impatient than ever to be at the pump-room, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might inform
herself of General Tilney’s lodgings, for though she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) believed they were
in Milsom Street, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) was not certain of the house, and Mrs. Allen’s
wavering convictions only made it more doubtful. To Milsom Street she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
was directed, and having made herself perfect in the number, hastened
away with eager steps and a beating heart to pay her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) visit, explain her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>)
conduct, and be forgiven; tripping lightly through the church-yard, and
resolutely turning away her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) eyes, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) might not be obliged to see
her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) beloved Isabella and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) dear family, who, she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had reason to
believe, were in a shop hard by. She (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) reached the house without any
impediment, looked at the number, knocked at the door, and inquired for
Miss Tilney. The man believed Miss Tilney to be at home, but was not
quite certain. Would she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be pleased to send up her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) name? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
card. In a few minutes the servant returned, and with a look which did
not quite confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) words, said he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) had been mistaken, for that Miss
Tilney was walked out. Catherine, with a blush of mortification, left
the house. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) felt almost persuaded that Miss Tilney _was_ at home,
and too much offended to admit her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>); and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) retired down the street,
could not withhold one glance at the drawing-room windows, in
expectation of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) there, but no one appeared at them. At the
bottom of the street, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) looked back again, and then, not at
a window, but issuing from the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) saw Miss Tilney herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
was followed by a gentleman, whom Catherine believed to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father,
and they turned up towards Edgar’s Buildings. Catherine, in deep
mortification, proceeded on her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could almost be angry herself
at such angry incivility; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) checked the resentful sensation; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own ignorance. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not how such an offence as hers
might be classed by the laws of worldly politeness, to what a degree of
unforgivingness it might with propriety lead, nor to what rigours of
rudeness in return it might justly make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) amenable.

<p/>Dejected and humbled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had even some thoughts of not going with the
others to the theatre that night; but it must be confessed that they
were not of long continuance, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) soon recollected, in the first
place, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was without any excuse for staying at home; and, in the
second, that it was a play she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) wanted very much to see. To the theatre
accordingly they all went; no Tilneys appeared to plague or please her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>);
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) feared that, amongst the many perfections of the family, a fondness
for plays was not to be ranked; but perhaps it was because they were
habituated to the finer performances of the London stage, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
knew, on Isabella’s authority, rendered everything else of the kind
<div class="bookquote">"quite horrid."  (<font color='red'><b>Isabella</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was not deceived in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own expectation of
pleasure; the comedy so well suspended her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) care that no one, observing
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) during the first four acts, would have supposed she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had any
wretchedness about her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). On the beginning of the fifth, however, the
sudden view of Mr. Henry Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) father, joining a party in the
opposite box, recalled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) to anxiety and distress. The stage could no
longer excite genuine merriment—no longer keep her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) whole attention.
Every other look upon an average was directed towards the opposite box;
and, for the space of two entire scenes, did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thus watch Henry
Tilney, without being once able to catch his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eye. No longer could he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) be
suspected of indifference for a play; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) notice was never withdrawn
from the stage during two whole scenes. At length, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) did look
towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) bowed—but such a bow! No smile, no continued
observance attended it; his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) eyes were immediately returned to their
former direction. Catherine was restlessly miserable; she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could almost
have run round to the box in which he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sat and forced him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
explanation. Feelings rather natural than heroic possessed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); instead
of considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own dignity injured by this ready
condemnation—instead of proudly resolving, in conscious innocence, to
show her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resentment towards him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) who could harbour a doubt of it, to
leave to him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) all the trouble of seeking an explanation, and to
enlighten him (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) on the past only by avoiding his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sight, or flirting with
somebody else—she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) took to herself all the shame of misconduct, or at
least of its appearance, and was only eager for an opportunity of
explaining its cause.

<p/>The play concluded—the curtain fell—Henry Tilney was no longer to be
seen where he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) had hitherto sat, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) father remained, and perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
might be now coming round to their box. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was right; in a few minutes
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) appeared, and, making his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) way through the then thinning rows, spoke
with like calm politeness to Mrs. Allen and her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) friend. Not with such
calmness was he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) answered by the latter: "Oh! Mr. Tilney, I have been
quite wild to speak to you, and make my apologies. You must have
thought me so rude; but indeed it was not my own fault, was it, Mrs.
Allen? Did not they tell me that Mr. Tilney and his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister were gone
out in a phaeton together? And then what could I do? But I had ten
thousand times rather have been with you; now had not I, Mrs. Allen?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear, you tumble my gown,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Allen</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Allen’s reply.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) assurance, however, standing sole as it did, was not thrown away;
it brought a more cordial, more natural smile into his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) countenance, and
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) replied in a tone which retained only a little affected reserve: <div class="bookquote">"We
were much obliged to you at any rate for wishing us a pleasant walk
after our passing you in Argyle Street: you were so kind as to look
back on purpose."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"But indeed I did not wish you a pleasant walk; I never thought of such
a thing; but I begged Mr. Thorpe so earnestly to stop; I called out to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) as soon as ever I saw you; now, Mrs. Allen, did not—Oh! You were
not there; but indeed I did; and, if Mr. Thorpe would only have
stopped, I would have jumped out and run after you."

<p/>Is there a Henry in the world who could be insensible to such a
declaration? Henry Tilney at least was not. With a yet sweeter smile,
he (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) said everything that need be said of his (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) sister’s concern, regret,
and dependence on Catherine’s honour. <div class="bookquote">"Oh! Do not say Miss Tilney was
not angry,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>cried Catherine, "because I know she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) would not
see me this morning when I called; I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) walk out of the house the
next minute after my leaving it; I was hurt, but I was not affronted.
Perhaps you did not know I had been there."

<p/>"I was not within at the time; but I heard of it from Eleanor, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
has been wishing ever since to see you, to explain the reason of such
incivility; but perhaps I can do it as well. It was nothing more than
that my father—they were just preparing to walk out, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being
hurried for time, and not caring to have it put off—made a point of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
being denied. That was all, I do assure you. She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was very much vexed,
and meant to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) apology as soon as possible."

<p/>Catherine’s mind was greatly eased by this information, yet a something
of solicitude remained, from which sprang the following question,
thoroughly artless in itself, though rather distressing to the
gentleman: "But, Mr. Tilney, why were _you_ less generous than your
sister? If she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) felt such confidence in my good intentions, and could
suppose it to be only a mistake, why should _you_ be so ready to take
offence?"

<p/>"Me! I take offence!"

<p/>"Nay, I am sure by your look, when you came into the box, you were
angry."

<p/>"I angry! I could have no right."

<p/>"Well, nobody would have thought you had no right who saw your face."
He (<font color='blue'><b>Me</b></font>) replied by asking her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) to make room for him (<font color='blue'><b>Me</b></font>), and talking of the play.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Me</b></font>) remained with them some time, and was only too agreeable for
Catherine to be contented when he (<font color='blue'><b>Me</b></font>) went away. Before they parted,
however, it was agreed that the projected walk should be taken as soon
as possible; and, setting aside the misery of his (<font color='blue'><b>Me</b></font>) quitting their box,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was, upon the whole, left one of the happiest creatures in the
world.

<p/>While talking to each other, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had observed with some surprise that
John Thorpe, who was never in the same part of the house for ten
minutes together, was engaged in conversation with General Tilney; and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) felt something more than surprise when she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) could
perceive herself the object of their attention and discourse. What
could they have to say of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)? She (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) feared General Tilney did not like
her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) appearance: she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) found it was implied in his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) preventing her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
admittance to his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) daughter, rather than postpone his (<font color='blue'><b>General</b></font>) own walk a few
minutes. <div class="bookquote">"How came Mr. Thorpe to know your father?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) anxious
inquiry, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) pointed them out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) companion. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) knew nothing
about it; but his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) father, like every military man, had a very large
acquaintance.

<p/>When the entertainment was over, Thorpe came to assist them in getting
out. Catherine was the immediate object of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) gallantry; and, while
they waited in the lobby for a chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) prevented the inquiry which
had travelled from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) heart almost to the tip of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) tongue, by
asking, in a consequential manner, whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) talking
with General Tilney: "He (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) is a fine old fellow, upon my soul! Stout,
active—looks as young as his (<font color='blue'><b>Stout</b></font>) son. I have a great regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Stout</b></font>), I
assure you: a gentleman-like, good sort of fellow as ever lived."

<p/>"But how came you to know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Know him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>)! There are few people much about town that I do not know. I
have met him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) forever at the Bedford; and I knew his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) face again today
the moment he (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) came into the billiard-room. One of the best players we
have, by the by; and we had a little touch together, though I was
almost afraid of him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) at first: the odds were five to four against me;
and, if I had not made one of the cleanest strokes that perhaps ever
was made in this world—I took his (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>) ball exactly—but I could not make you
understand it without a table; however, I _did_ beat him (<font color='blue'><b>fellow</b></font>). A very fine
fellow; as rich as a Jew. I should like to dine with him (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>); I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>)
gives famous dinners. But what do you think we have been talking of?
You. Yes, by heavens! And the general thinks you the finest girl in
Bath."

<p/>"Oh! Nonsense! How can you say so?"

<p/>"And what do you think I said?"—lowering his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) voice—"well done, general,
said I; I am quite of your mind."

<p/>Here Catherine, who was much less gratified by his (<font color='blue'><b>Jew</b></font>) admiration than by
General Tilney’s, was not sorry to be called away by Mr. Allen. Thorpe,
however, would see her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) to her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) chair, and, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) entered it,
continued the same kind of delicate flattery, in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>)
entreating him (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) to have done.

<p/>That General Tilney, instead of disliking, should admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>), was very
delightful; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) joyfully thought that there was not one of the
family whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) need now fear to meet. The evening had done more, much
more, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Tilney</b></font>) than could have been expected.
