<p/>Fanny had by no means forgotten Mr. Crawford when she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) awoke the next
morning; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) remembered the purport of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) note, and was not less
sanguine as to its effect than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had been the night before. If Mr.
Crawford would but go away! That was what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) most earnestly desired:
go and take his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister with him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was to do, and as he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) returned to
Mansfield on purpose to do. And why it was not done already she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
not devise, for Miss Crawford certainly wanted no delay. Fanny had
hoped, in the course of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) yesterday’s visit, to hear the day named;
but he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) had only spoken of their journey as what would take place ere
long.

<p/>Having so satisfactorily settled the conviction her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) note would convey,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not but be astonished to see Mr. Crawford, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
accidentally did, coming up to the house again, and at an hour as early
as the day before. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) coming might have nothing to do with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) must avoid seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) if possible; and being then on her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) way
upstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) resolved there to remain, during the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) visit,
unless actually sent for; and as Mrs. Norris was still in the house,
there seemed little danger of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being wanted.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sat some time in a good deal of agitation, listening, trembling,
and fearing to be sent for every moment; but as no footsteps approached
the East room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) grew gradually composed, could sit down, and be able
to employ herself, and able to hope that Mr. Crawford had come and
would go without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) being obliged to know anything of the matter.

<p/>Nearly half an hour had passed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was growing very comfortable,
when suddenly the sound of a step in regular approach was heard; a
heavy step, an unusual step in that part of the house: it was her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
uncle’s; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) knew it as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) voice; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had trembled at it as
often, and began to tremble again, at the idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) coming up to
speak to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>), whatever might be the subject. It was indeed Sir Thomas
who opened the door and asked if she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) were there, and if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) might come
in. The terror of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) former occasional visits to that room seemed all
renewed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) felt as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) were going to examine her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) again in
French and English.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was all attention, however, in placing a chair for him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), and trying
to appear honoured; and, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) agitation, had quite overlooked the
deficiencies of her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) apartment, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), stopping short as he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) entered,
said, with much surprise, <div class="bookquote">"Why have you no fire to-day?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>There was snow on the ground, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was sitting in a shawl. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>)
hesitated.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am not cold, sir: I never sit here long at this time of year."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"But you have a fire in general?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"No, sir."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"How comes this about? Here must be some mistake. I understood that you
had the use of this room by way of making you perfectly comfortable. In
your bedchamber I know you _cannot_ have a fire. Here is some great
misapprehension which must be rectified. It is highly unfit for you to
sit, be it only half an hour a day, without a fire. You are not strong.
You are chilly. Your aunt cannot be aware of this."

<p/>Fanny would rather have been silent; but being obliged to speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
could not forbear, in justice to the aunt she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) loved best, from saying
something in which the words <div class="bookquote">"my aunt Norris"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>were distinguishable.

<p/>"I understand," cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle, recollecting himself, and not wanting
to hear more: "I understand. Your aunt Norris has always been an
advocate, and very judiciously, for young people’s being brought up
without unnecessary indulgences; but there should be moderation in
everything. She (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) is also very hardy herself, which of course will
influence her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) opinion of the wants of others. And on another
account, too, I can perfectly comprehend. I know what her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) sentiments
have always been. The principle was good in itself, but it may have
been, and I believe _has_ _been_, carried too far in your case. I am
aware that there has been sometimes, in some points, a misplaced
distinction; but I think too well of you, Fanny, to suppose you will
ever harbour resentment on that account. You have an understanding
which will prevent you from receiving things only in part, and judging
partially by the event. You will take in the whole of the past, you
will consider times, persons, and probabilities, and you will feel that
_they_ were not least your friends who were educating and preparing you
for that mediocrity of condition which _seemed_ to be your lot. Though
their caution may prove eventually unnecessary, it was kindly meant;
and of this you may be assured, that every advantage of affluence will
be doubled by the little privations and restrictions that may have been
imposed. I am sure you will not disappoint my opinion of you, by
failing at any time to treat your aunt Norris with the respect and
attention that are due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>). But enough of this. Sit down, my dear. I
must speak to you for a few minutes, but I will not detain you long."

<p/>Fanny obeyed, with eyes cast down and colour rising. After a moment’s
pause, Sir Thomas, trying to suppress a smile, went on.

<p/>"You are not aware, perhaps, that I have had a visitor this morning. I
had not been long in my own room, after breakfast, when Mr. Crawford
was shewn in. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) errand you may probably conjecture."

<p/>Fanny’s colour grew deeper and deeper; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, perceiving that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was embarrassed to a degree that made either speaking or looking up
quite impossible, turned away his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) own eyes, and without any farther
pause proceeded in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) account of Mr. Crawford’s visit.

<p/>Mr. Crawford’s business had been to declare himself the lover of Fanny,
make decided proposals for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and entreat the sanction of the uncle,
who seemed to stand in the place of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) parents; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had done it all
so well, so openly, so liberally, so properly, that Sir Thomas,
feeling, moreover, his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own replies, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own remarks to have been
very much to the purpose, was exceedingly happy to give the particulars
of their conversation; and little aware of what was passing in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
niece’s mind, conceived that by such details he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) must be gratifying her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
far more than himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) talked, therefore, for several minutes
without Fanny’s daring to interrupt him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had hardly even attained
the wish to do it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind was in too much confusion. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had changed
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) position; and, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eyes fixed intently on one of the windows,
was listening to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle in the utmost perturbation and dismay. For a
moment he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) ceased, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had barely become conscious of it, when,
rising from his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) chair, he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) said, "And now, Fanny, having performed one
part of my commission, and shewn you everything placed on a basis the
most assured and satisfactory, I may execute the remainder by
prevailing on you to accompany me downstairs, where, though I cannot
but presume on having been no unacceptable companion myself, I must
submit to your finding one still better worth listening to. Mr.
Crawford, as you have perhaps foreseen, is yet in the house. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) is in
my room, and hoping to see you there."

<p/>There was a look, a start, an exclamation on hearing this, which
astonished Sir Thomas; but what was his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) increase of astonishment on
hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) exclaim—"Oh! no, sir, I cannot, indeed I cannot go down to
him (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). Mr. Crawford ought to know—he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) must know that: I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) enough
yesterday to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) spoke to me on this subject yesterday,
and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) without disguise that it was very disagreeable to me,
and quite out of my power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) good opinion."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not catch your meaning,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, sitting down again.
"Out of your power to return his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) good opinion? What is all this? I know
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) spoke to you yesterday, and (as far as I understand) received as
much encouragement to proceed as a well-judging young woman could
permit herself to give. I was very much pleased with what I collected
to have been your behaviour on the occasion; it shewed a discretion
highly to be commended. But now, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) has made his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) overtures so
properly, and honourably—what are your scruples _now_?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You are mistaken, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>cried Fanny, forced by the anxiety of the
moment even to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) was wrong; "you are quite
mistaken. How could Mr. Crawford say such a thing? I gave him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) no
encouragement yesterday. On the contrary, I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), I cannot
recollect my exact words, but I am sure I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) that I would not
listen to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), that it was very unpleasant to me in every respect, and
that I begged him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) never to talk to me in that manner again. I am sure I
said as much as that and more; and I should have said still more, if I
had been quite certain of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meaning anything seriously; but I did not
like to be, I could not bear to be, imputing more than might be
intended. I thought it might all pass for nothing with _him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) could say no more; her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) breath was almost gone.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>Am I to understand," said Sir Thomas, after a few moments’ silence,
"that you mean to _refuse_ Mr. Crawford?"

<p/>"Yes, sir."

<p/>"Refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Yes, sir."

<p/>"Refuse Mr. Crawford! Upon what plea? For what reason?"

<p/>"I—I cannot like him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), sir, well enough to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is very strange!"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, in a voice of calm
displeasure. "There is something in this which my comprehension does
not reach. Here is a young man wishing to pay his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) addresses to you,
with everything to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): not merely situation in life,
fortune, and character, but with more than common agreeableness, with
address and conversation pleasing to everybody. And he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) is not an
acquaintance of to-day; you have now known him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) some time. His (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) sister,
moreover, is your intimate friend, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) has been doing _that_ for
your brother, which I should suppose would have been almost sufficient
recommendation to you, had there been no other. It is very uncertain
when my interest might have got William on. He (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) has done it already."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Fanny</b></font>)</div>said Fanny, in a faint voice, and looking down with fresh shame;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did feel almost ashamed of herself, after such a picture as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
uncle had drawn, for not liking Mr. Crawford.

<p/>"You must have been aware," continued Sir Thomas presently, "you must
have been some time aware of a particularity in Mr. Crawford’s manners
to you. This cannot have taken you by surprise. You must have observed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions; and though you always received them very properly (I
have no accusation to make on that head), I never perceived them to be
unpleasant to you. I am half inclined to think, Fanny, that you do not
quite know your own feelings."

<p/>"Oh yes, sir! indeed I do. His (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) attentions were always—what I did not
like.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sir Thomas looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) with deeper surprise. " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>This is beyond me,"
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>). "This requires explanation. Young as you are, and having seen
scarcely any one, it is hardly possible that your affections—"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) paused and eyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) fixedly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) lips formed into a _no_,
though the sound was inarticulate, but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) face was like scarlet. That,
however, in so modest a girl, might be very compatible with innocence;
and chusing at least to appear satisfied, he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) quickly added, "No, no, I
know _that_ is quite out of the question; quite impossible. Well, there
is nothing more to be said."

<p/>And for a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) did say nothing. He (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>) was deep in thought. His (<font color='blue'><b>Young</b></font>)
niece was deep in thought likewise, trying to harden and prepare
herself against farther questioning. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) would rather die than own the
truth; and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) hoped, by a little reflection, to fortify herself beyond
betraying it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Independently of the interest which Mr. Crawford’s _choice_ seemed to
justify"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir Thomas, beginning again, and very composedly, "his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
wishing to marry at all so early is recommendatory to me. I am an
advocate for early marriages, where there are means in proportion, and
would have every young man, with a sufficient income, settle as soon
after four-and-twenty as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can. This is so much my opinion, that I am
sorry to think how little likely my own eldest son, your cousin, Mr.
Bertram, is to marry early; but at present, as far as I can judge,
matrimony makes no part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) plans or thoughts. I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) were more
likely to fix.<div class="bookquote">" Here was a glance at Fanny. " (<font color='red'><b>Edmund</b></font>)</div>Edmund, I consider, from
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) dispositions and habits, as much more likely to marry early than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) brother. _He (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)_, indeed, I have lately thought, has seen the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>)
could love, which, I am convinced, my eldest son has not. Am I right?
Do you agree with me, my dear?"

<p/>"Yes, sir."

<p/>It was gently, but it was calmly said, and Sir Thomas was easy on the
score of the cousins. But the removal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) alarm did his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece no
service: as her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) unaccountableness was confirmed his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) displeasure
increased; and getting up and walking about the room with a frown,
which Fanny could picture to herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) dared not lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
eyes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) shortly afterwards, and in a voice of authority, said, <div class="bookquote">"Have
you any reason, child, to think ill of Mr. Crawford’s temper?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"No, sir."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) longed to add, "But of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) principles I have"; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart sunk
under the appalling prospect of discussion, explanation, and probably
non-conviction. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) ill opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) was founded chiefly on
observations, which, for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cousins’ sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could scarcely dare
mention to their father. Maria and Julia, and especially Maria, were so
closely implicated in Mr. Crawford’s misconduct, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) could not
give his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) character, such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) believed it, without betraying them.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) had hoped that, to a man like her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) uncle, so discerning, so
honourable, so good, the simple acknowledgment of settled _dislike_ on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) side would have been sufficient. To her (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) infinite grief she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) found it
was not.

<p/>Sir Thomas came towards the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Maria</b></font>) sat in trembling
wretchedness, and with a good deal of cold sternness, said, "It is of
no use, I perceive, to talk to you. We had better put an end to this
most mortifying conference. Mr. Crawford must not be kept longer
waiting. I will, therefore, only add, as thinking it my duty to mark my
opinion of your conduct, that you have disappointed every expectation I
had formed, and proved yourself of a character the very reverse of what
I had supposed. For I _had_, Fanny, as I think my behaviour must have
shewn, formed a very favourable opinion of you from the period of my
return to England. I had thought you peculiarly free from wilfulness of
temper, self-conceit, and every tendency to that independence of spirit
which prevails so much in modern days, even in young women, and which
in young women is offensive and disgusting beyond all common offence.
But you have now shewn me that you can be wilful and perverse; that you
can and will decide for yourself, without any consideration or
deference for those who have surely some right to guide you, without
even asking their advice. You have shewn yourself very, very different
from anything that I had imagined. The advantage or disadvantage of
your family, of your parents, your brothers and sisters, never seems to
have had a moment’s share in your thoughts on this occasion. How _they_
might be benefited, how _they_ must rejoice in such an establishment
for you, is nothing to _you_. You think only of yourself, and because
you do not feel for Mr. Crawford exactly what a young heated fancy
imagines to be necessary for happiness, you resolve to refuse him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at
once, without wishing even for a little time to consider of it, a
little more time for cool consideration, and for really examining your
own inclinations; and are, in a wild fit of folly, throwing away from
you such an opportunity of being settled in life, eligibly, honourably,
nobly settled, as will, probably, never occur to you again. Here is a
young man of sense, of character, of temper, of manners, and of
fortune, exceedingly attached to you, and seeking your hand in the most
handsome and disinterested way; and let me tell you, Fanny, that you
may live eighteen years longer in the world without being addressed by
a man of half Mr. Crawford’s estate, or a tenth part of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) merits.
Gladly would I have bestowed either of my own daughters on him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>). Maria
is nobly married; but had Mr. Crawford sought Julia’s hand, I should
have given it to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) with superior and more heartfelt satisfaction than
I gave Maria’s to Mr. Rushworth." After half a moment’s pause: "And I
should have been very much surprised had either of my daughters, on
receiving a proposal of marriage at any time which might carry with it
only _half_ the eligibility of _this_, immediately and peremptorily,
and without paying my opinion or my regard the compliment of any
consultation, put a decided negative on it. I should have been much
surprised and much hurt by such a proceeding. I should have thought it
a gross violation of duty and respect. _You_ are not to be judged by
the same rule. You do not owe me the duty of a child. But, Fanny, if
your heart can acquit you of _ingratitude_—"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) ceased. Fanny was by this time crying so bitterly that, angry as he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>)
was, he (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) would not press that article farther. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart was almost
broke by such a picture of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) appeared to him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>); by such
accusations, so heavy, so multiplied, so rising in dreadful gradation!
Self-willed, obstinate, selfish, and ungrateful. He (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) all
this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had deceived his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) expectations; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had lost his (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) good opinion.
What was to become of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)?

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am very sorry,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) inarticulately, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears, <div class="bookquote">"I am
very sorry indeed."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"Sorry! yes, I hope you are sorry; and you will probably have reason to
be long sorry for this day’s transactions."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If it were possible for me to do otherwise"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), with another
strong effort; "but I am so perfectly convinced that I could never make
him (<font color='blue'><b>my</b></font>) happy, and that I should be miserable myself."

<p/>Another burst of tears; but in spite of that burst, and in spite of
that great black word _miserable_, which served to introduce it, Sir
Thomas began to think a little relenting, a little change of
inclination, might have something to do with it; and to augur
favourably from the personal entreaty of the young man himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) knew
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to be very timid, and exceedingly nervous; and thought it not
improbable that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind might be in such a state as a little time, a
little pressing, a little patience, and a little impatience, a
judicious mixture of all on the lover’s side, might work their usual
effect on. If the gentleman would but persevere, if he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) had but love
enough to persevere, Sir Thomas began to have hopes; and these
reflections having passed across his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) mind and cheered it, <div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said
he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>), in a tone of becoming gravity, but of less anger, "well, child, dry
up your tears. There is no use in these tears; they can do no good. You
must now come downstairs with me. Mr. Crawford has been kept waiting
too long already. You must give him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) your own answer: we cannot expect
him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) to be satisfied with less; and you only can explain to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) the
grounds of that misconception of your sentiments, which, unfortunately
for himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) certainly has imbibed. I am totally unequal to it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But Fanny shewed such reluctance, such misery, at the idea of going
down to him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>), that Sir Thomas, after a little consideration, judged it
better to indulge her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). His (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) hopes from both gentleman and lady suffered
a small depression in consequence; but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) looked at his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, and
saw the state of feature and complexion which her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) crying had brought
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) into, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) thought there might be as much lost as gained by an
immediate interview. With a few words, therefore, of no particular
meaning, he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) walked off by himself, leaving his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) poor niece to sit and
cry over what had passed, with very wretched feelings.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) mind was all disorder. The past, present, future, everything was
terrible. But her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle’s anger gave her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) the severest pain of all.
Selfish and ungrateful! to have appeared so to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was miserable
for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) had no one to take her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) part, to counsel, or speak for
her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) only friend was absent. He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) might have softened his (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) father; but
all, perhaps all, would think her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) selfish and ungrateful. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might
have to endure the reproach again and again; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) might hear it, or see
it, or know it to exist for ever in every connexion about her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>)
could not but feel some resentment against Mr. Crawford; yet, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
really loved her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>), and were unhappy too! It was all wretchedness
together.

<p/>In about a quarter of an hour her (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) uncle returned; she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was almost ready
to faint at the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) spoke calmly, however, without
austerity, without reproach, and she (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) revived a little. There was
comfort, too, in his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) words, as well as his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) manner, for he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) began with,
" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Crawford</b></font>)</div>Mr. Crawford is gone: he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has just left me. I need not repeat what has
passed. I do not want to add to anything you may now be feeling, by an
account of what he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has felt. Suffice it, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) has behaved in the
most gentlemanlike and generous manner, and has confirmed me in a most
favourable opinion of his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) understanding, heart, and temper. Upon my
representation of what you were suffering, he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) immediately, and with the
greatest delicacy, ceased to urge to see you for the present.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Here Fanny, who had looked up, looked down again. " (<font color='red'><b>uncle</b></font>)</div>Of course,"
continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, "it cannot be supposed but that he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) should request
to speak with you alone, be it only for five minutes; a request too
natural, a claim too just to be denied. But there is no time fixed;
perhaps to-morrow, or whenever your spirits are composed enough. For
the present you have only to tranquillise yourself. Check these tears;
they do but exhaust you. If, as I am willing to suppose, you wish to
shew me any observance, you will not give way to these emotions, but
endeavour to reason yourself into a stronger frame of mind. I advise
you to go out: the air will do you good; go out for an hour on the
gravel; you will have the shrubbery to yourself, and will be the better
for air and exercise. And, Fanny" (turning back again for a moment), "I
shall make no mention below of what has passed; I shall not even tell
your aunt Bertram. There is no occasion for spreading the
disappointment; say nothing about it yourself."

<p/>This was an order to be most joyfully obeyed; this was an act of
kindness which Fanny felt at her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) heart. To be spared from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt
Norris’s interminable reproaches! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bertram</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) in a glow of gratitude.
Anything might be bearable rather than such reproaches. Even to see Mr.
Crawford would be less overpowering.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walked out directly, as her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle recommended, and followed his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
advice throughout, as far as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could; did check her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) tears; did
earnestly try to compose her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) spirits and strengthen her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) mind. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
wished to prove to him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) did desire his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) comfort, and sought to
regain his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) favour; and he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) another strong motive for
exertion, in keeping the whole affair from the knowledge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunts.
Not to excite suspicion by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) look or manner was now an object worth
attaining; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) felt equal to almost anything that might save her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was struck, quite struck, when, on returning from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) walk and
going into the East room again, the first thing which caught her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) eye
was a fire lighted and burning. A fire! it seemed too much; just at
that time to be giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) such an indulgence was exciting even painful
gratitude. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) wondered that Sir Thomas could have leisure to think of
such a trifle again; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) soon found, from the voluntary information
of the housemaid, who came in to attend it, that so it was to be every
day. Sir Thomas had given orders for it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must be a brute, indeed, if I can be really ungrateful!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>),
in soliloquy. <div class="bookquote">"Heaven defend me from being ungrateful!"

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) saw nothing more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle, nor of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt Norris, till they
met at dinner. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) uncle’s behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was then as nearly as
possible what it had been before; she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) did not mean there
should be any change, and that it was only her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) own conscience that
could fancy any; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt was soon quarrelling with her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>); and when
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) found how much and how unpleasantly her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) having only walked out
without her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) aunt’s knowledge could be dwelt on, she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) felt all the reason
she (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) had to bless the kindness which saved her (<font color='blue'><b>Norris</b></font>) from the same spirit of
reproach, exerted on a more momentous subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I had known you were going out, I should have got you just to go as
far as my house with some orders for Nanny,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Nanny</b></font>), "which I have
since, to my very great inconvenience, been obliged to go and carry
myself. I could very ill spare the time, and you might have saved me
the trouble, if you would only have been so good as to let us know you
were going out. It would have made no difference to you, I suppose,
whether you had walked in the shrubbery or gone to my house."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I recommended the shrubbery to Fanny as the driest place,"  (<font color='red'><b>Thomas</b></font>)</div>said Sir
Thomas.

<p/>"Oh!" said Mrs. Norris, with a moment’s check, "that was very kind of
you, Sir Thomas; but you do not know how dry the path is to my house.
Fanny would have had quite as good a walk there, I assure you, with the
advantage of being of some use, and obliging her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) aunt: it is all her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
fault. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would but have let us know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was going out but there is
a something about Fanny, I have often observed it before—she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) likes to
go her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own way to work; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) does not like to be dictated to; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) takes
her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) own independent walk whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) can; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) certainly has a little
spirit of secrecy, and independence, and nonsense, about her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), which I
would advise her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) to get the better of."

<p/>As a general reflection on Fanny, Sir Thomas thought nothing could be
more unjust, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) had been so lately expressing the same
sentiments himself, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) tried to turn the conversation: tried
repeatedly before he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) could succeed; for Mrs. Norris had not discernment
enough to perceive, either now, or at any other time, to what degree he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>)
thought well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) niece, or how very far he (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) was from wishing to have
his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own children’s merits set off by the depreciation of hers. She (<font color='blue'><b>niece</b></font>) was
talking _at_ Fanny, and resenting this private walk half through the
dinner.

<p/>It was over, however, at last; and the evening set in with more
composure to Fanny, and more cheerfulness of spirits than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could
have hoped for after so stormy a morning; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) trusted, in the first
place, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had done right: that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) judgment had not misled her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>).
For the purity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) intentions she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could answer; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was willing
to hope, secondly, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle’s displeasure was abating, and would
abate farther as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) considered the matter with more impartiality, and
felt, as a good man must feel, how wretched, and how unpardonable, how
hopeless, and how wicked it was to marry without affection.

<p/>When the meeting with which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) was threatened for the morrow was past,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could not but flatter herself that the subject would be finally
concluded, and Mr. Crawford once gone from Mansfield, that everything
would soon be as if no such subject had existed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) would not, could
not believe, that Mr. Crawford’s affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) could distress him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
long; his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) mind was not of that sort. London would soon bring its cure.
In London he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would soon learn to wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) infatuation, and be
thankful for the right reason in her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) which had saved him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) from its evil
consequences.

<p/>While Fanny’s mind was engaged in these sort of hopes, her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) uncle was,
soon after tea, called out of the room; an occurrence too common to
strike her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), and she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought nothing of it till the butler reappeared
ten minutes afterwards, and advancing decidedly towards herself, said,
<div class="bookquote">"Sir Thomas wishes to speak with you, ma’am, in his (<font color='blue'><b>Thomas</b></font>) own room."  (<font color='red'><b>the butler</b></font>)</div>Then it
occurred to her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) what might be going on; a suspicion rushed over her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
mind which drove the colour from her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) cheeks; but instantly rising, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
was preparing to obey, when Mrs. Norris called out, "Stay, stay, Fanny!
what are you about? where are you going? don’t be in such a hurry.
Depend upon it, it is not you who are wanted; depend upon it, it is me"
(looking at the butler); "but you are so very eager to put yourself
forward. What should Sir Thomas want you for? It is me, Baddeley, you
mean; I am coming this moment. You mean me, Baddeley, I am sure; Sir
Thomas wants me, not Miss Price.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>But Baddeley was stout. " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>No, ma’am, it is Miss Price; I am certain of
its being Miss Price." And there was a half-smile with the words, which
meant, "I do not think you would answer the purpose at all."

<p/>Mrs. Norris, much discontented, was obliged to compose herself to work
again; and Fanny, walking off in agitating consciousness, found
herself, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) anticipated, in another minute alone with Mr. Crawford.
