<p/>Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) county, then embodied.

<p/>Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) military life had introduced him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), nobody was surprized, except her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) brother and his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife, who had never seen him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.

<p/>Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fortune though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) think every thing due to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in return for the great goodness of being in love with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>); but though she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had one sort of spirit, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had not the best. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had resolution enough to pursue her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own will in spite of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) former home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not cease to love her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.

<p/>Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife died, after a three years' marriage, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the expense of the child, however, he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was soon relieved. The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) decease. Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own comfort to seek, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own situation to improve as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could.

<p/>A complete change of life became desirable. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) a favourable opening. It was a concern which brought just employment enough. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) life passed cheerfully away. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had, by that time, realised an easy competence enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had always longed for enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own friendly and social disposition.

<p/>It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) determination of never settling till he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had made his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fortune, bought his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) house, and obtained his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had never been an unhappy man; his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own temper had secured him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) from that, even in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) first marriage; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) second must shew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had only himself to please in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) choice: his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fortune was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should ever want his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's assistance. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) believed, so deservedly dear. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) saw his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son every year in London, and was proud of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) fond report of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) too. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) merits and prospects a kind of common concern.

<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill was one of the boasts of Highbury, and a lively curiosity to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) prevailed, though the compliment was so little returned that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been there in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) life. His (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) coming to visit his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father had been often talked of but never achieved.

<p/>Now, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had written to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) new mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. "I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) says he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) never saw such a handsome letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) life.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) marriage had already secured. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had lived long enough to know how fortunate she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>).

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) knew that at times she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) must be missed; and could not think, without pain, of Emma's losing a single pleasure, or suffering an hour's ennui, from the want of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companionableness: but dear Emma was of no feeble character; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was more equal to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation than most girls would have been, and had sense, and energy, and spirits that might be hoped would bear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) well and happily through its little difficulties and privations. And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) satisfaction her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) more than satisfaction her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) being still able to pity ' (<font color='red'><b>Miss Taylor</b></font>)</div>poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go away in the evening attended by her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) pleasant husband to a carriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) own. But never did she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) would be very glad to stay."

<p/>There was no recovering Miss Taylor nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>); but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) neighbours were over; he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), was all eat up. His (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could never believe other people to be different from himself. What was unwholesome to him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) regarded as unfit for any body; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) benevolent nerves till it was all gone.

<p/>There was a strange rumour in Highbury of all the little Perrys being seen with a slice of Mrs. Weston's wedding-cake in their hands: but Mr. Woodhouse would never believe it.
