<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope I shall soon have the pleasure of introducing my son to you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston.

<p/>Mrs. Elton, very willing to suppose a particular compliment intended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) by such a hope, smiled most graciously.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You have heard of a certain Frank Churchill, I presume,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) continued <div class="bookquote">"and know him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be my son, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) does not bear my name."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! yes, and I shall be very happy in his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) acquaintance. I am sure Mr. Elton will lose no time in calling on him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>); and we shall both have great pleasure in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) at the Vicarage."

<p/>"You are very obliging. Frank will be extremely happy, I am sure.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) is to be in town next week, if not sooner. We have notice of it in a letter to-day. I met the letters in my way this morning, and seeing my son's hand, presumed to open it though it was not directed to me it was to Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) principal correspondent, I assure you. I hardly ever get a letter."

<p/>"And so you absolutely opened what was directed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)! Oh! Mr. Weston (laughing affectedly) I must protest against that. A most dangerous precedent indeed! I beg you will not let your neighbours follow your example. Upon my word, if this is what I am to expect, we married women must begin to exert ourselves! Oh! Mr. Weston, I could not have believed it of you!"

<p/>"Aye, we men are sad fellows. You must take care of yourself, Mrs. Elton. This letter tells us it is a short letter written in a hurry, merely to give us notice it tells us that they are all coming up to town directly, on Mrs. Churchill's account she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has not been well the whole winter, and thinks Enscombe too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) so they are all to move southward without loss of time."

<p/>"Indeed! from Yorkshire, I think. Enscombe is in Yorkshire?"

<p/>"Yes, they are about one hundred and ninety miles from London, a considerable journey."

<p/>"Yes, upon my word, very considerable. Sixty-five miles farther than from Maple Grove to London. But what is distance, Mr. Weston, to people of large fortune? You would be amazed to hear how my brother, Mr. Suckling, sometimes flies about. You will hardly believe me but twice in one week he (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) and Mr. Bragge went to London and back again with four horses."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The evil of the distance from Enscombe,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Weston, "is, that Mrs. Churchill, as we understand, has not been able to leave the sofa for a week together. In Frank's last letter she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) complained, he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) said, of being too weak to get into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conservatory without having both his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) arm and his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle's! This, you know, speaks a great degree of weakness but now she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is so impatient to be in town, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) means to sleep only two nights on the road. So Frank writes word. Certainly, delicate ladies have very extraordinary constitutions, Mrs. Elton. You must grant me that."

<p/>"No, indeed, I shall grant you nothing. I always take the part of my own sex. I do indeed. I give you notice You will find me a formidable antagonist on that point. I always stand up for women and I assure you, if you knew how Selina feels with respect to sleeping at an inn, you would not wonder at Mrs. Churchill's making incredible exertions to avoid it. Selina says it is quite horror to her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) and I believe I have caught a little of her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) nicety. She (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) always travels with her (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) own sheets; an excellent precaution. Does Mrs. Churchill do the same?"

<p/>"Depend upon it, Mrs. Churchill does every thing that any other fine lady ever did. Mrs. Churchill will not be second to any lady in the land for"

<p/>Mrs. Elton eagerly interposed with,

<p/>"Oh! Mr. Weston, do not mistake me. Selina is no fine lady, I assure you. Do not run away with such an idea."

<p/>"Is not she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>)? Then she (<font color='blue'><b>Selina</b></font>) is no rule for Mrs. Churchill, who is as thorough a fine lady as any body ever beheld."

<p/>Mrs. Elton began to think she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had been wrong in disclaiming so warmly. It was by no means her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) object to have it believed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sister was not a fine lady; perhaps there was want of spirit in the pretence of it; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was considering in what way she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had best retract, when Mr. Weston went on.

<p/>"Mrs. Churchill is not much in my good graces, as you may suspect but this is quite between ourselves. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is very fond of Frank, and therefore I would not speak ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). Besides, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is out of health now; but that indeed, by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has always been. I would not say so to every body, Mrs. Elton, but I have not much faith in Mrs. Churchill's illness."

<p/>"If she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is really ill, why not go to Bath, Mr. Weston? To Bath, or to Clifton?" "She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has taken it into her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) head that Enscombe is too cold for her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). The fact is, I suppose, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is tired of Enscombe. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) has now been a longer time stationary there, than she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) ever was before, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) begins to want change. It is a retired place. A fine place, but very retired."

<p/>"Aye like Maple Grove, I dare say. Nothing can stand more retired from the road than Maple Grove. Such an immense plantation all round it! You seem shut out from every thing in the most complete retirement. And Mrs. Churchill probably has not health or spirits like Selina to enjoy that sort of seclusion. Or, perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may not have resources enough in herself to be qualified for a country life. I always say a woman cannot have too many resources and I feel very thankful that I have so many myself as to be quite independent of society."

<p/>"Frank was here in February for a fortnight."

<p/>"So I remember to have heard. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) will find an addition to the society of Highbury when he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) comes again; that is, if I may presume to call myself an addition. But perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) may never have heard of there being such a creature in the world."

<p/>This was too loud a call for a compliment to be passed by, and Mr. Weston, with a very good grace, immediately exclaimed,

<p/>"My dear madam! Nobody but yourself could imagine such a thing possible. Not heard of you! I believe Mrs. Weston's letters lately have been full of very little else than Mrs. Elton.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had done his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) duty and could return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Frank</b></font>)</div>When Frank left us," continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>), "it was quite uncertain when we might see him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again, which makes this day's news doubly welcome. It has been completely unexpected. That is, I always had a strong persuasion he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) would be here again soon, I was sure something favourable would turn up but nobody believed me. He (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) and Mrs. Weston were both dreadfully desponding. <div class="bookquote">'How could he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) contrive to come? And how could it be supposed that his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) uncle and aunt would spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) again?'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>and so forth I always felt that something would happen in our favour; and so it has, you see. I have observed, Mrs. Elton, in the course of my life, that if things are going untowardly one month, they are sure to mend the next."

<p/>"Very true, Mr. Weston, perfectly true. It is just what I used to say to a certain gentleman in company in the days of courtship, when, because things did not go quite right, did not proceed with all the rapidity which suited his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) feelings, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was apt to be in despair, and exclaim that he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was sure at this rate it would be May before Hymen's saffron robe would be put on for us. Oh! the pains I have been at to dispel those gloomy ideas and give him (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) cheerfuller views! The carriage we had disappointments about the carriage; one morning, I remember, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) came to me quite in despair.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was stopped by a slight fit of coughing, and Mr. Weston instantly seized the opportunity of going on.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>You were mentioning May. May is the very month which Mrs. Churchill is ordered, or has ordered herself, to spend in some warmer place than Enscombe in short, to spend in London; so that we have the agreeable prospect of frequent visits from Frank the whole spring precisely the season of the year which one should have chosen for it: days almost at the longest; weather genial and pleasant, always inviting one out, and never too hot for exercise. When he (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) was here before, we made the best of it; but there was a good deal of wet, damp, cheerless weather; there always is in February, you know, and we could not do half that we intended. Now will be the time. This will be complete enjoyment; and I do not know, Mrs. Elton, whether the uncertainty of our meetings, the sort of constant expectation there will be of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) coming in to-day or to-morrow, and at any hour, may not be more friendly to happiness than having him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) actually in the house. I think it is so. I think it is the state of mind which gives most spirit and delight. I hope you will be pleased with my son; but you must not expect a prodigy. He (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is generally thought a fine young man, but do not expect a prodigy. Mrs. Weston's partiality for him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>) is very great, and, as you may suppose, most gratifying to me. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thinks nobody equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>prodigy</b></font>)."

<p/>"And I assure you, Mr. Weston, I have very little doubt that my opinion will be decidedly in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) favour. I have heard so much in praise of Mr. Frank Churchill. At the same time it is fair to observe, that I am one of those who always judge for themselves, and are by no means implicitly guided by others. I give you notice that as I find your son, so I shall judge of him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>). I am no flatterer.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Weston was musing.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I hope," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) presently, "I have not been severe upon poor Mrs. Churchill. If she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is ill I should be sorry to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) injustice; but there are some traits in her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) character which make it difficult for me to speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) with the forbearance I could wish. You cannot be ignorant, Mrs. Elton, of my connexion with the family, nor of the treatment I have met with; and, between ourselves, the whole blame of it is to be laid to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was the instigator. Frank's mother would never have been slighted as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was but for her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). Mr. Churchill has pride; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) pride is nothing to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife's: his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is a quiet, indolent, gentlemanlike sort of pride that would harm nobody, and only make himself a little helpless and tiresome; but her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) pride is arrogance and insolence! And what inclines one less to bear, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has no fair pretence of family or blood. She (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) was nobody when he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) married her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>), barely the daughter of a gentleman; but ever since her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) being turned into a Churchill she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) has out-Churchill'd them all in high and mighty claims: but in herself, I assure you, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) is an upstart."

<p/>"Only think! well, that must be infinitely provoking! I have quite a horror of upstarts. Maple Grove has given me a thorough disgust to people of that sort; for there is a family in that neighbourhood who are such an annoyance to my brother and sister from the airs they give themselves! Your description of Mrs. Churchill made me think of them directly. People of the name of Tupman, very lately settled there, and encumbered with many low connexions, but giving themselves immense airs, and expecting to be on a footing with the old established families. A year and a half is the very utmost that they can have lived at West Hall; and how they got their fortune nobody knows. They came from Birmingham, which is not a place to promise much, you know, Mr. Weston. One has not great hopes from Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound: but nothing more is positively known of the Tupmans, though a good many things I assure you are suspected; and yet by their manners they evidently think themselves equal even to my brother, Mr. Suckling, who happens to be one of their nearest neighbours. It is infinitely too bad. Mr. Suckling, who has been eleven years a resident at Maple Grove, and whose father had it before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) I believe, at least I am almost sure that old Mr. Suckling had completed the purchase before his (<font color='blue'><b>Suckling</b></font>) death."

<p/>They were interrupted. Tea was carrying round, and Mr. Weston, having said all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wanted, soon took the opportunity of walking away.

<p/>After tea, Mr. and Mrs. Weston, and Mr. Elton sat down with Mr. Woodhouse to cards. The remaining five were left to their own powers, and Emma doubted their getting on very well; for Mr. Knightley seemed little disposed for conversation; Mrs. Elton was wanting notice, which nobody had inclination to pay, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was herself in a worry of spirits which would have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prefer being silent.

<p/>Mr. John Knightley proved more talkative than his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) brother. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was to leave them early the next day; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) soon began with

<p/>"Well, Emma, I do not believe I have any thing more to say about the boys; but you have your sister's letter, and every thing is down at full length there we may be sure. My charge would be much more concise than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)'s, and probably not much in the same spirit; all that I have to recommend being comprised in, do not spoil them, and do not physic them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I rather hope to satisfy you both,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "for I shall do all in my power to make them happy, which will be enough for Isabella; and happiness must preclude false indulgence and physic."

<p/>"And if you find them troublesome, you must send them home again."

<p/>"That is very likely. You think so, do not you?"

<p/>"I hope I am aware that they may be too noisy for your father or even may be some encumbrance to you, if your visiting engagements continue to increase as much as they have done lately."

<p/>"Increase!"

<p/>"Certainly; you must be sensible that the last half-year has made a great difference in your way of life."

<p/>"Difference! No indeed I am not."

<p/>"There can be no doubt of your being much more engaged with company than you used to be. Witness this very time. Here am I come down for only one day, and you are engaged with a dinner-party! When did it happen before, or any thing like it? Your neighbourhood is increasing, and you mix more with it. A little while ago, every letter to Isabella brought an account of fresh gaieties; dinners at Mr. Cole's, or balls at the Crown. The difference which Randalls, Randalls alone makes in your goings-on, is very great."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>said his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brother quickly, "it is Randalls that does it all."

<p/>"Very well and as Randalls, I suppose, is not likely to have less influence than heretofore, it strikes me as a possible thing, Emma, that Henry and John may be sometimes in the way. And if they are, I only beg you to send them home."

<p/>"No,<div class="bookquote">" cried Mr. Knightley, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>that need not be the consequence. Let them be sent to Donwell. I shall certainly be at leisure."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Upon my word,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>exclaimed Emma, "you amuse me! I should like to know how many of all my numerous engagements take place without your being of the party; and why I am to be supposed in danger of wanting leisure to attend to the little boys. These amazing engagements of mine what have they been? Dining once with the Coles and having a ball talked of, which never took place. I can understand you (nodding at Mr. John Knightley) your good fortune in meeting with so many of your friends at once here, delights you too much to pass unnoticed. But you, (turning to Mr. Knightley,) who know how very, very seldom I am ever two hours from Hartfield, why you should foresee such a series of dissipation for me, I cannot imagine. And as to my dear little boys, I must say, that if Aunt Emma has not time for them, I do not think they would fare much better with Uncle Knightley, who is absent from home about five hours where she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is absent one and who, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) is at home, is either reading to himself or settling his (<font color='blue'><b>Uncle</b></font>) accounts."

<p/>Mr. Knightley seemed to be trying not to smile; and succeeded without difficulty, upon Mrs. Elton's beginning to talk to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>).
