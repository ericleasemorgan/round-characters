<p/>Though Charles and Mary had remained at Lyme much longer after Mr and
Mrs Musgrove's going than Anne conceived they could have been at all
wanted, they were yet the first of the family to be at home again; and
as soon as possible after their return to Uppercross they drove over to
the Lodge.  They had left Louisa beginning to sit up; but her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head,
though clear, was exceedingly weak, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) nerves susceptible to the
highest extreme of tenderness; and though she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) might be pronounced to be
altogether doing very well, it was still impossible to say when she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
might be able to bear the removal home; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) father and mother, who
must return in time to receive their younger children for the Christmas
holidays, had hardly a hope of being allowed to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) with them.

<p/>They had been all in lodgings together.  Mrs Musgrove had got Mrs
Harville's children away as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) could, every possible supply
from Uppercross had been furnished, to lighten the inconvenience to the
Harvilles, while the Harvilles had been wanting them to come to dinner
every day; and in short, it seemed to have been only a struggle on each
side as to which should be most disinterested and hospitable.

<p/>Mary had had her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) evils; but upon the whole, as was evident by her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
staying so long, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had found more to enjoy than to suffer.  Charles
Hayter had been at Lyme oftener than suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>); and when they dined
with the Harvilles there had been only a maid-servant to wait, and at
first Mrs Harville had always given Mrs Musgrove precedence; but then,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had received so very handsome an apology from her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) on finding out
whose daughter she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was, and there had been so much going on every day,
there had been so many walks between their lodgings and the Harvilles,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had got books from the library, and changed them so often, that
the balance had certainly been much in favour of Lyme.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had been
taken to Charmouth too, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had bathed, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had gone to church,
and there were a great many more people to look at in the church at
Lyme than at Uppercross; and all this, joined to the sense of being so
very useful, had made really an agreeable fortnight.

<p/>Anne enquired after Captain Benwick. Mary's face was clouded directly.
Charles laughed.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! Captain Benwick is very well, I believe, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is a very odd
young man.  I do not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would be at.  We asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to come
home with us for a day or two:  Charles undertook to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) some
shooting, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) seemed quite delighted, and, for my part, I thought it
was all settled; when behold! on Tuesday night, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) made a very awkward
sort of excuse; ' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never shot' and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had <div class="bookquote">'been quite misunderstood,'
 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had promised this and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had promised that, and the end of it
was, I found, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not mean to come.  I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was afraid of
finding it dull; but upon my word I should have thought we were lively
enough at the Cottage for such a heart-broken man as Captain Benwick."

<p/>Charles laughed again and said, <div class="bookquote">"Now Mary, you know very well how it
really was.  It was all your doing,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Hayter</b></font>)</div>(turning to Anne.) "He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fancied
that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) went with us, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) should find you close by: he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) fancied
everybody to be living in Uppercross; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) discovered that Lady
Russell lived three miles off, his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) heart failed him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not
courage to come.  That is the fact, upon my honour. Mary knows it is."

<p/>But Mary did not give into it very graciously, whether from not
considering Captain Benwick entitled by birth and situation to be in
love with an Elliot, or from not wanting to believe Anne a greater
attraction to Uppercross than herself, must be left to be guessed.
Anne's good-will, however, was not to be lessened by what she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) boldly acknowledged herself flattered, and continued her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) enquiries.

<p/>"Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) talks of you,<div class="bookquote">" cried Charles, " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>in such terms--<div class="bookquote">" Mary
interrupted him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>). " (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>I declare, Charles, I never heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) mention Anne
twice all the time I was there.  I declare, Anne, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never talks of you
at all."

<p/>"No," admitted Charles, <div class="bookquote">"I do not know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) ever does, in a general
way; but however, it is a very clear thing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) admires you
exceedingly.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) head is full of some books that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is reading upon
your recommendation, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wants to talk to you about them; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has
found out something or other in one of them which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) thinks--oh! I
cannot pretend to remember it, but it was something very fine--I
overheard him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) telling Henrietta all about it; and then ' (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Hayter</b></font>)</div>Miss Elliot'
was spoken of in the highest terms!  Now Mary, I declare it was so, I
heard it myself, and you were in the other room.  <div class="bookquote">'Elegance, sweetness,
beauty.'  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! there was no end of Miss Elliot's charms."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I am sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>cried Mary, warmly, "it was a very little to his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
credit, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did.  Miss Harville only died last June.  Such a heart is
very little worth having; is it, Lady Russell?  I am sure you will
agree with me."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must see Captain Benwick before I decide,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell,
smiling.

<p/>"And that you are very likely to do very soon, I can tell you, ma'am,"
said Charles.  "Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had not nerves for coming away with us, and
setting off again afterwards to pay a formal visit here, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will make
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) way over to Kellynch one day by himself, you may depend on it.  I
told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) the distance and the road, and I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) of the church's
being so very well worth seeing; for as he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) has a taste for those sort
of things, I thought that would be a good excuse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) listened with
all his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) understanding and soul; and I am sure from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) manner that you
will have him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) calling here soon.  So, I give you notice, Lady Russell."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Any acquaintance of Anne's will always be welcome to me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>was Lady
Russell's kind answer.

<p/>"Oh! as to being Anne's acquaintance," said Mary, "I think he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is rather
my acquaintance, for I have been seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) every day this last
fortnight."

<p/>"Well, as your joint acquaintance, then, I shall be very happy to see
Captain Benwick."

<p/>"You will not find anything very agreeable in him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>), I assure you, ma'am.
He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is one of the dullest young men that ever lived.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) has walked with
me, sometimes, from one end of the sands to the other, without saying a
word.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) is not at all a well-bred young man.  I am sure you will not
like him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"There we differ, Mary,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne</b></font>)</div>said Anne.  "I think Lady Russell would like
him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>).  I think she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) would be so much pleased with his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) mind, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
would very soon see no deficiency in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) manner."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So do I, Anne,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Hayter</b></font>)</div>said Charles.  "I am sure Lady Russell would like him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).
He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is just Lady Russell's sort.  Give him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a book, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will read all
day long."

<p/>"Yes, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will!<div class="bookquote">" exclaimed Mary, tauntingly.  " (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) will sit poring
over his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) book, and not know when a person speaks to him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), or when one
drops one's scissors, or anything that happens.  Do you think Lady
Russell would like that?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Lady Russell could not help laughing.  " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>Upon my word," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>), "I
should not have supposed that my opinion of any one could have admitted
of such difference of conjecture, steady and matter of fact as I may
call myself.  I have really a curiosity to see the person who can give
occasion to such directly opposite notions.  I wish he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) may be induced
to call here.  And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) does, Mary, you may depend upon hearing my
opinion; but I am determined not to judge him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) beforehand."

<p/>"You will not like him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), I will answer for it."

<p/>Lady Russell began talking of something else.  Mary spoke with
animation of their meeting with, or rather missing, Mr Elliot so
extraordinarily.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) is a man,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, "whom I have no wish to see.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
declining to be on cordial terms with the head of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) family, has left
a very strong impression in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) disfavour with me."

<p/>This decision checked Mary's eagerness, and stopped her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) short in the
midst of the Elliot countenance.

<p/>With regard to Captain Wentworth, though Anne hazarded no enquiries,
there was voluntary communication sufficient.  His (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) spirits had been
greatly recovering lately as might be expected.  As Louisa improved, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had improved, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was now quite a different creature from what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
had been the first week.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not seen Louisa; and was so extremely
fearful of any ill consequence to her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) from an interview, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) did
not press for it at all; and, on the contrary, seemed to have a plan of
going away for a week or ten days, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head was stronger.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
talked of going down to Plymouth for a week, and wanted to persuade
Captain Benwick to go with him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); but, as Charles maintained to the last,
Captain Benwick seemed much more disposed to ride over to Kellynch.

<p/>There can be no doubt that Lady Russell and Anne were both occasionally
thinking of Captain Benwick, from this time.  Lady Russell could not
hear the door-bell without feeling that it might be his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) herald; nor
could Anne return from any stroll of solitary indulgence in her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
father's grounds, or any visit of charity in the village, without
wondering whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) might see him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) or hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>).  Captain Benwick
came not, however.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) was either less disposed for it than Charles had
imagined, or he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was too shy; and after giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) a week's indulgence,
Lady Russell determined him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to be unworthy of the interest which he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had
been beginning to excite.

<p/>The Musgroves came back to receive their happy boys and girls from
school, bringing with them Mrs Harville's little children, to improve
the noise of Uppercross, and lessen that of Lyme.  Henrietta remained
with Louisa; but all the rest of the family were again in their usual
quarters.

<p/>Lady Russell and Anne paid their compliments to them once, when Anne
could not but feel that Uppercross was already quite alive again.
Though neither Henrietta, nor Louisa, nor Charles Hayter, nor Captain
Wentworth were there, the room presented as strong a contrast as could
be wished to the last state she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) had seen it in.

<p/>Immediately surrounding Mrs Musgrove were the little Harvilles, whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was sedulously guarding from the tyranny of the two children from
the Cottage, expressly arrived to amuse them.  On one side was a table
occupied by some chattering girls, cutting up silk and gold paper; and
on the other were tressels and trays, bending under the weight of brawn
and cold pies, where riotous boys were holding high revel; the whole
completed by a roaring Christmas fire, which seemed determined to be
heard, in spite of all the noise of the others.  Charles and Mary also
came in, of course, during their visit, and Mr Musgrove made a point of
paying his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) respects to Lady Russell, and sat down close to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) for ten
minutes, talking with a very raised voice, but from the clamour of the
children on his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) knees, generally in vain.  It was a fine family-piece.

<p/>Anne, judging from her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own temperament, would have deemed such a
domestic hurricane a bad restorative of the nerves, which Louisa's
illness must have so greatly shaken.  But Mrs Musgrove, who got Anne
near her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) on purpose to thank her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) most cordially, again and again, for
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) attentions to them, concluded a short recapitulation of what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had suffered herself by observing, with a happy glance round the
room, that after all she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had gone through, nothing was so likely to do
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) good as a little quiet cheerfulness at home.

<p/>Louisa was now recovering apace.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) mother could even think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
being able to join their party at home, before her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brothers and sisters
went to school again.  The Harvilles had promised to come with her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) and
stay at Uppercross, whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) returned.  Captain Wentworth was gone,
for the present, to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) brother in Shropshire.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope I shall remember, in future,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lady Russell</b></font>)</div>said Lady Russell, as soon as
they were reseated in the carriage, "not to call at Uppercross in the
Christmas holidays."

<p/>Everybody has their taste in noises as well as in other matters; and
sounds are quite innoxious, or most distressing, by their sort rather
than their quantity.  When Lady Russell not long afterwards, was
entering Bath on a wet afternoon, and driving through the long course
of streets from the Old Bridge to Camden Place, amidst the dash of
other carriages, the heavy rumble of carts and drays, the bawling of
newspapermen, muffin-men and milkmen, and the ceaseless clink of
pattens, she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) made no complaint.  No, these were noises which belonged
to the winter pleasures; her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) spirits rose under their influence; and
like Mrs Musgrove, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was feeling, though not saying, that after being
long in the country, nothing could be so good for her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) as a little quiet
cheerfulness.

<p/>Anne did not share these feelings.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) persisted in a very determined,
though very silent disinclination for Bath; caught the first dim view
of the extensive buildings, smoking in rain, without any wish of seeing
them better; felt their progress through the streets to be, however
disagreeable, yet too rapid; for who would be glad to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) when she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
arrived?  And looked back, with fond regret, to the bustles of
Uppercross and the seclusion of Kellynch.

<p/>Elizabeth's last letter had communicated a piece of news of some
interest.  Mr Elliot was in Bath.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had called in Camden Place; had
called a second time, a third; had been pointedly attentive.  If
Elizabeth and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father did not deceive themselves, had been taking
much pains to seek the acquaintance, and proclaim the value of the
connection, as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) had formerly taken pains to shew neglect.  This was
very wonderful if it were true; and Lady Russell was in a state of very
agreeable curiosity and perplexity about Mr Elliot, already recanting
the sentiment she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had so lately expressed to Mary, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) being <div class="bookquote">"a man
whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had no wish to see."   (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had a great wish to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>).  If he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
really sought to reconcile himself like a dutiful branch, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) must be
forgiven for having dismembered himself from the paternal tree.

<p/>Anne was not animated to an equal pitch by the circumstance, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
felt that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would rather see Mr Elliot again than not, which was more
than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could say for many other persons in Bath.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was put down in Camden Place; and Lady Russell then drove to her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>)
own lodgings, in Rivers Street.
