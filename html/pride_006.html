<p/>The ladies of Longbourn soon waited on those of Netherfield. The
visit was soon returned in due form. Miss Bennet’s pleasing
manners grew on the goodwill of Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley; and
though the mother was found to be intolerable, and the younger
sisters not worth speaking to, a wish of being better acquainted
with _them_ was expressed towards the two eldest. By Jane, this
attention was received with the greatest pleasure, but Elizabeth
still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody,
hardly excepting even her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and could not like them; though
their kindness to Jane, such as it was, had a value as arising in
all probability from the influence of their brother’s admiration.
It was generally evident whenever they met, that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) _did_ admire
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ it was equally evident that Jane was yielding to
the preference which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had begun to entertain for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from the
first, and was in a way to be very much in love; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered
by the world in general, since Jane united, with great strength
of feeling, a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of
manner which would guard her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) from the suspicions of the
impertinent. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) mentioned this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) friend Miss Lucas.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It may perhaps be pleasant,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>replied Charlotte, "to be able to
impose on the public in such a case; but it is sometimes a
disadvantage to be so very guarded. If a woman conceals her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>)
affection with the same skill from the object of it, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) may lose
the opportunity of fixing him (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>); and it will then be but poor
consolation to believe the world equally in the dark. There is so
much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment, that it
is not safe to leave any to itself. We can all _begin_ freely—a
slight preference is natural enough; but there are very few of us
who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement.
In nine cases out of ten a woman had better show _more_ affection
than she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) feels. Bingley likes your sister undoubtedly; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) may
never do more than like her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), if she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) does not help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) on."

<p/>"But she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) does help him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) on, as much as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) nature will allow. If
_I_ can perceive her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) regard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) must be a simpleton,
indeed, not to discover it too."

<p/>"Remember, Eliza, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) does not know Jane’s disposition as you
do."

<p/>"But if a woman is partial to a man, and does not endeavour to
conceal it, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must find it out."

<p/>"Perhaps he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) sees enough of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>). But, though Bingley
and Jane meet tolerably often, it is never for many hours
together; and, as they always see each other in large mixed
parties, it is impossible that every moment should be employed in
conversing together. Jane should therefore make the most of every
half-hour in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) can command his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) attention. When she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is
secure of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), there will be more leisure for falling in love as
much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) chooses."

<p/>"Your plan is a good one," replied Elizabeth, "where nothing is
in question but the desire of being well married, and if I were
determined to get a rich husband, or any husband, I dare say I
should adopt it. But these are not Jane’s feelings; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is not
acting by design. As yet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cannot even be certain of the
degree of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) own regard nor of its reasonableness. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) has known
him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) only a fortnight. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) danced four dances with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) at Meryton;
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saw him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) one morning at his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) own house, and has since dined
with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) in company four times. This is not quite enough to make
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) understand his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) character."

<p/>"Not as you represent it. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) merely _dined_ with him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
might only have discovered whether he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had a good appetite; but
you must remember that four evenings have also been spent
together—and four evenings may do a great deal."

<p/>"Yes; these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that
they both like Vingt-un better than Commerce; but with respect to
any other leading characteristic, I do not imagine that much has
been unfolded."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)</div>said Charlotte, "I wish Jane success with all my heart;
and if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were married to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) to-morrow, I should think she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had
as good a chance of happiness as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) were to be studying his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>)
character for a twelvemonth. Happiness in marriage is entirely a
matter of chance. If the dispositions of the parties are ever so
well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand, it does
not advance their felicity in the least. They always continue to
grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of
vexation; and it is better to know as little as possible of the
defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life."

<p/>"You make me laugh, Charlotte; but it is not sound. You know it
is not sound, and that you would never act in this way yourself."

<p/>Occupied in observing Mr. Bingley’s attentions to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) sister,
Elizabeth was far from suspecting that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was herself becoming
an object of some interest in the eyes of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend. Mr. Darcy
had at first scarcely allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to be pretty; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had looked at
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) without admiration at the ball; and when they next met, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) only to criticise. But no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) made it
clear to himself and his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) friends that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) hardly had a good
feature in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) face, than he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to find it was rendered
uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dark
eyes. To this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying.
Though he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had detected with a critical eye more than one failure
of perfect symmetry in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) form, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was forced to acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
figure to be light and pleasing; and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) asserting
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manners were not those of the fashionable world, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was
caught by their easy playfulness. Of this she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was perfectly
unaware; to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was only the man who made himself agreeable
nowhere, and who had not thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) handsome enough to dance
with.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to wish to know more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and as a step towards
conversing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) himself, attended to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) conversation with
others. His (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) doing so drew her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) notice. It was at Sir William
Lucas’s, where a large party were assembled.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What does Mr. Darcy mean,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to Charlotte, "by listening
to my conversation with Colonel Forster?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is a question which Mr. Darcy only can answer."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>"But if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) does it any more I shall certainly let him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) know that I
see what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is about. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has a very satirical eye, and if I do
not begin by being impertinent myself, I shall soon grow afraid
of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/>On his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) approaching them soon afterwards, though without seeming
to have any intention of speaking, Miss Lucas defied her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) friend
to mention such a subject to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>); which immediately provoking
Elizabeth to do it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turned to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) and said:

<p/>"Did you not think, Mr. Darcy, that I expressed myself uncommonly
well just now, when I was teasing Colonel Forster to give us a
ball at Meryton?"

<p/>"With great energy; but it is always a subject which makes a lady
energetic."

<p/>"You are severe on us."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It will be _her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)_ turn soon to be teased,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Lucas</b></font>)</div>said Miss Lucas. "I am
going to open the instrument, Eliza, and you know what follows."

<p/>"You are a very strange creature by way of a friend!—always
wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody! If my
vanity had taken a musical turn, you would have been invaluable;
but as it is, I would really rather not sit down before those who
must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers." On
Miss Lucas’s persevering, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) added, "Very well, if it
must be so, it must." And gravely glancing at Mr. Darcy, "There
is a fine old saying, which everybody here is of course familiar
with: <div class="bookquote">‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge’ (<font color='red'><b>everybody</b></font>)</div>; and I shall keep
mine to swell my song."

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a
song or two, and before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) could reply to the entreaties of
several that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) would sing again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) was eagerly succeeded at
the instrument by her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) sister Mary, who having, in consequence of
being the only plain one in the family, worked hard for knowledge
and accomplishments, was always impatient for display.

<p/>Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) application, it had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) likewise a pedantic air and
conceited manner, which would have injured a higher degree of
excellence than she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected,
had been listened to with much more pleasure, though not playing
half so well; and Mary, at the end of a long concerto, was glad
to purchase praise and gratitude by Scotch and Irish airs, at the
request of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) younger sisters, who, with some of the Lucases,
and two or three officers, joined eagerly in dancing at one end
of the room.

<p/>Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of
passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and
was too much engrossed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) thoughts to perceive that Sir
William Lucas was his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) neighbour, till Sir William thus began:

<p/>"What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy!
There is nothing like dancing after all. I consider it as one of
the first refinements of polished society."

<p/>"Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue
amongst the less polished societies of the world. Every savage
can dance.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Sir William only smiled. " (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Your friend performs delightfully," he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
continued after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; "and I
doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr.
Darcy."

<p/>"You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir."

<p/>"Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the
sight. Do you often dance at St. James’s?"

<p/>"Never, sir."

<p/>"Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?"

<p/>"It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid
it."

<p/>"You have a house in town, I conclude?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. Darcy bowed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I had once had some thought of fixing in town myself—for I am
fond of superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that
the air of London would agree with Lady Lucas."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) paused in hopes of an answer; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) companion was not
disposed to make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving
towards them, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was struck with the action of doing a very
gallant thing, and called out to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>):

<p/>"My dear Miss Eliza, why are you not dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must
allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable
partner. You cannot refuse to dance, I am sure when so much
beauty is before you." And, taking her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) would have given
it to Mr. Darcy who, though extremely surprised, was not
unwilling to receive it, when she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) instantly drew back, and said
with some discomposure to Sir William:

<p/>"Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I
entreat you not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg
for a partner."

<p/>Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the
honour of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor
did Sir William at all shake her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) purpose by his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) attempt at
persuasion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to
deny me the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman
dislikes the amusement in general, he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) can have no objection, I am
sure, to oblige us for one half-hour."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Mr. Darcy is all politeness,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Elizabeth Bennet/Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, smiling.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is, indeed; but, considering the inducement, my dear Miss
Eliza, we cannot wonder at his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) complaisance—for who would object
to such a partner?"

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth/Miss Elizabeth Bennet/Miss Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resistance had not
injured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with the gentleman, and he (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) was thinking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) with
some complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I can guess the subject of your reverie."

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"I should imagine not."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many
evenings in this manner—in such society; and indeed I am quite of
your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet
the noise—the nothingness, and yet the self-importance of all
those people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!"

<p/>"Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more
agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great
pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman
can bestow."

<p/>Miss Bingley immediately fixed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eyes on his (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) face, and desired
he (<font color='blue'><b>people</b></font>) would tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) what lady had the credit of inspiring such
reflections. Mr. Darcy replied with great intrepidity:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Elizabeth Bennet."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Elizabeth Bennet!"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>repeated Miss Bingley. "I am all
astonishment. How long has she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) been such a favourite?—and pray,
when am I to wish you joy?"

<p/>"That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A
lady’s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to
love, from love to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be
wishing me joy."

<p/>"Nay, if you are serious about it, I shall consider the matter is
absolutely settled. You will be having a charming mother-in-law,
indeed; and, of course, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will always be at Pemberley with
you."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) with perfect indifference while she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) chose to
entertain herself in this manner; and as his (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) composure convinced
her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) that all was safe, her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) wit flowed long.
