<p/>Convinced as Elizabeth now was that Miss Bingley’s dislike of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
had originated in jealousy, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not help feeling how
unwelcome her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) appearance at Pemberley must be to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and was
curious to know with how much civility on that lady’s side the
acquaintance would now be renewed.

<p/>On reaching the house, they were shown through the hall into the
saloon, whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer.
Its windows opening to the ground, admitted a most refreshing
view of the high woody hills behind the house, and of the
beautiful oaks and Spanish chestnuts which were scattered over
the intermediate lawn.

<p/>In this house they were received by Miss Darcy, who was sitting
there with Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley, and the lady with whom
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) lived in London. Georgiana’s reception of them was very
civil, but attended with all the embarrassment which, though
proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong, would easily
give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
being proud and reserved. Mrs. Gardiner and her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece, however,
did her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) justice, and pitied her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>).

<p/>By Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley they were noticed only by a
curtsey; and, on their being seated, a pause, awkward as such
pauses must always be, succeeded for a few moments. It was first
broken by Mrs. Annesley, a genteel, agreeable-looking woman,
whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) to
be more truly well-bred than either of the others; and between
her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) and Mrs. Gardiner, with occasional help from Elizabeth, the
conversation was carried on. Miss Darcy looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished
for courage enough to join in it; and sometimes did venture a
short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard.

<p/>Elizabeth soon saw that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was herself closely watched by Miss
Bingley, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not speak a word, especially to Miss
Darcy, without calling her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) attention. This observation would not
have prevented her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) from trying to talk to the latter, had they
not been seated at an inconvenient distance; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was not
sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) own thoughts
were employing her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expected every moment that some of the
gentlemen would enter the room. She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) feared that the
master of the house might be amongst them; and whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) wished
or feared it most, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could scarcely determine. After sitting in
this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing Miss Bingley’s
voice, Elizabeth was roused by receiving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a cold enquiry
after the health of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answered with equal
indifference and brevity, and the other said no more.

<p/>The next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the
entrance of servants with cold meat, cake, and a variety of all
the finest fruits in season; but this did not take place till
after many a significant look and smile from Mrs. Annesley to
Miss Darcy had been given, to remind her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) post. There was
now employment for the whole party—for though they could not all
talk, they could all eat; and the beautiful pyramids of grapes,
nectarines, and peaches soon collected them round the table.

<p/>While thus engaged, Elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding
whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) most feared or wished for the appearance of Mr.
Darcy, by the feelings which prevailed on his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) entering the room;
and then, though but a moment before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wishes
to predominate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) began to regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) came.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had been some time with Mr. Gardiner, who, with two or three
other gentlemen from the house, was engaged by the river, and had
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) only on learning that the ladies of the family intended
a visit to Georgiana that morning. No sooner did he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) appear than
Elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed;
a resolution the more necessary to be made, but perhaps not the
more easily kept, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw that the suspicions of the
whole party were awakened against them, and that there was
scarcely an eye which did not watch his (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) behaviour when he (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) first
came into the room. In no countenance was attentive curiosity so
strongly marked as in Miss Bingley’s, in spite of the smiles
which overspread her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) face whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) spoke to one of its
objects; for jealousy had not yet made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) desperate, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
attentions to Mr. Darcy were by no means over. Miss Darcy, on her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
brother’s entrance, exerted herself much more to talk, and
Elizabeth saw that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister and herself to
get acquainted, and forwarded as much as possible, every attempt
at conversation on either side. Miss Bingley saw all this
likewise; and, in the imprudence of anger, took the first
opportunity of saying, with sneering civility:

<p/>"Pray, Miss Eliza, are not the ——shire Militia removed from
Meryton? They must be a great loss to _your_ family."

<p/>In Darcy’s presence she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) dared not mention Wickham’s name; but
Elizabeth instantly comprehended that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) was uppermost in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
thoughts; and the various recollections connected with him (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) gave
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a moment’s distress; but exerting herself vigorously to repel
the ill-natured attack, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) presently answered the question in a
tolerably detached tone. While she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) spoke, an involuntary glance
showed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) Darcy, with a heightened complexion, earnestly looking
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Wickham</b></font>) sister overcome with confusion, and unable to
lift up her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) eyes. Had Miss Bingley known what pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was then
giving her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) beloved friend, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) undoubtedly would have refrained
from the hint; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had merely intended to discompose
Elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
believed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) partial, to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) betray a sensibility which
might injure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) in Darcy’s opinion, and, perhaps, to remind the
latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) family were connected with that corps. Not a syllable had
ever reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) of Miss Darcy’s meditated elopement. To no
creature had it been revealed, where secrecy was possible, except
to Elizabeth; and from all Bingley’s connections her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother was
particularly anxious to conceal it, from the very wish which
Elizabeth had long ago attributed to him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>), of their becoming
hereafter her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had certainly formed such a plan, and
without meaning that it should affect his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) endeavour to separate
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) from Miss Bennet, it is probable that it might add something
to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) lively concern for the welfare of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Elizabeth’s collected behaviour, however, soon quieted his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
emotion; and as Miss Bingley, vexed and disappointed, dared not
approach nearer to Wickham, Georgiana also recovered in time,
though not enough to be able to speak any more. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother,
whose eye she (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) feared to meet, scarcely recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) interest
in the affair, and the very circumstance which had been designed
to turn his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) thoughts from Elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) more and more cheerfully.

<p/>Their visit did not continue long after the question and answer
above mentioned; and while Mr. Darcy was attending them to their
carriage Miss Bingley was venting her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings in criticisms on
Elizabeth’s person, behaviour, and dress. But Georgiana would not
join her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>) brother’s recommendation was enough to ensure her (<font color='blue'><b>Georgiana</b></font>)
favour; his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) judgement could not err. And he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had spoken in such
terms of Elizabeth as to leave Georgiana without the power of
finding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) otherwise than lovely and amiable. When Darcy
returned to the saloon, Miss Bingley could not help repeating to
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) some part of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had been saying to his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sister.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"How very ill Miss Eliza Bennet looks this morning, Mr. Darcy,"
 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) cried; "I never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
is since the winter. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is grown so brown and coarse! Louisa and
I were agreeing that we should not have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) again.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>However little Mr. Darcy might have liked such an address, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
contented himself with coolly replying that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) perceived no other
alteration than her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) being rather tanned, no miraculous
consequence of travelling in the summer.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>For my own part," she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) rejoined, "I must confess that I never
could see any beauty in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>). Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) face is too thin; her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) complexion
has no brilliancy; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) features are not at all handsome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
nose wants character—there is nothing marked in its lines. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>)
teeth are tolerable, but not out of the common way; and as for
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) eyes, which have sometimes been called so fine, I could never
see anything extraordinary in them. They have a sharp, shrewish
look, which I do not like at all; and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) air altogether there
is a self-sufficiency without fashion, which is intolerable."

<p/>Persuaded as Miss Bingley was that Darcy admired Elizabeth, this
was not the best method of recommending herself; but angry people
are not always wise; and in seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) at last look somewhat
nettled, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had all the success she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) expected. He (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) was resolutely
silent, however, and, from a determination of making him (<font color='blue'><b>them</b></font>) speak,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) continued:

<p/>"I remember, when we first knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in Hertfordshire, how amazed
we all were to find that she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was a reputed beauty; and I
particularly recollect your saying one night, after they had been
dining at Netherfield, <div class="bookquote">‘_She (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ a beauty!—I should as soon call her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
mother a wit.’  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) seemed to improve on you, and I
believe you thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) rather pretty at one time."

<p/>"Yes,<div class="bookquote">" replied Darcy, who could contain himself no longer, " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but
_that_ was only when I first saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), for it is many months since
I have considered her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) as one of the handsomest women of my
acquaintance."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) then went away, and Miss Bingley was left to all the
satisfaction of having forced him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) to say what gave no one any
pain but herself.

<p/>Mrs. Gardiner and Elizabeth talked of all that had occurred
during their visit, as they returned, except what had
particularly interested them both. The look and behaviour of
everybody they had seen were discussed, except of the person who
had mostly engaged their attention. They talked of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) sister,
his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) friends, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) house, his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) fruit—of everything but himself; yet
Elizabeth was longing to know what Mrs. Gardiner thought of him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>),
and Mrs. Gardiner would have been highly gratified by her (<font color='blue'><b>Gardiner</b></font>) niece’s
beginning the subject.
