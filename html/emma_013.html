<p/>There could hardly be a happier creature in the world than Mrs. John Knightley, in this short visit to Hartfield, going about every morning among her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) old acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) five children, and talking over what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had done every evening with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father and sister. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had nothing to wish otherwise, but that the days did not pass so swiftly. It was a delightful visit; perfect, in being much too short.

<p/>In general their evenings were less engaged with friends than their mornings; but one complete dinner engagement, and out of the house too, there was no avoiding, though at Christmas. Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day; even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.

<p/>How they were all to be conveyed, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) would have made a difficulty if he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could, but as his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) son and daughter's carriage and horses were actually at Hartfield, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) was not able to make more than a simple question on that head; it hardly amounted to a doubt; nor did it occupy Emma long to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) that they might in one of the carriages find room for Harriet also.

<p/>Harriet, Mr. Elton, and Mr. Knightley, their own especial set, were the only persons invited to meet them; the hours were to be early, as well as the numbers few; Mr. Woodhouse's habits and inclination being consulted in every thing.

<p/>The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to leave the house. Emma called on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) the next day, and found her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doom already signed with regard to Randalls. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) from this delightful engagement, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not speak of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) loss without many tears.

<p/>Emma sat with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could, to attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) knew her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) state; and left her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) very much. She (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) might carry some report of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) to Hartfield they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend's complaint; <div class="bookquote">"a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), a quick, low pulse, &c. and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with them."  (<font color='red'><b>friend</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) exclaimed,

<p/>"A sore-throat! I hope not infectious. I hope not of a putrid infectious sort. Has Perry seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)? Indeed you should take care of yourself as well as of your friend. Let me entreat you to run no risks. Why does not Perry see her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)?"

<p/>Emma, who was not really at all frightened herself, tranquillised this excess of apprehension by assurances of Mrs. Goddard's experience and care; but as there must still remain a degree of uneasiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) could not wish to reason away, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) would rather feed and assist than not, she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) added soon afterwards as if quite another subject,

<p/>"It is so cold, so very cold and looks and feels so very much like snow, that if it were to any other place or with any other party, I should really try not to go out to-day and dissuade my father from venturing; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) has made up his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) mind, and does not seem to feel the cold himself, I do not like to interfere, as I know it would be so great a disappointment to Mr. and Mrs. Weston. But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself. You appear to me a little hoarse already, and when you consider what demand of voice and what fatigues to-morrow will bring, I think it would be no more than common prudence to stay at home and take care of yourself to-night."

<p/>Mr. Elton looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) did not very well know what answer to make; which was exactly the case; for though very much gratified by the kind care of such a fair lady, and not liking to resist any advice of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)'s, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had not really the least inclination to give up the visit; but Emma, too eager and busy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own previous conceptions and views to hear him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) impartially, or see him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) with clear vision, was very well satisfied with his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) muttering acknowledgment of its being <div class="bookquote">"very cold, certainly very cold,"  (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div>and walked on, rejoicing in having extricated him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) from Randalls, and secured him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the power of sending to inquire after Harriet every hour of the evening.

<p/>"You do quite right," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>); "we will make your apologies to Mr. and Mrs. Weston."

<p/>But hardly had she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) so spoken, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) found her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) brother was civilly offering a seat in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) carriage, if the weather were Mr. Elton's only objection, and Mr. Elton actually accepting the offer with much prompt satisfaction. It was a done thing; Mr. Elton was to go, and never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) broad handsome face expressed more pleasure than at this moment; never had his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) smile been stronger, nor his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) eyes more exulting than when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) next looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) to herself, "this is most strange! After I had got him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind! Most strange indeed! But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination such a passion for dining out a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot refuse an invitation, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) must dine out wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is asked. What a strange thing love is! he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can see ready wit in Harriet, but will not dine alone for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)."

<p/>Soon afterwards Mr. Elton quitted them, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could not but do him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) the justice of feeling that there was a great deal of sentiment in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) manner of naming Harriet at parting; in the tone of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice while assuring her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) should call at Mrs. Goddard's for news of her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) fair friend, the last thing before he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) prepared for the happiness of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) again, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) hoped to be able to give a better report; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) sighed and smiled himself off in a way that left the balance of approbation much in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) favour.

<p/>After a few minutes of entire silence between them, John Knightley began with

<p/>"I never in my life saw a man more intent on being agreeable than Mr. Elton. It is downright labour to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) where ladies are concerned. With men he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) can be rational and unaffected, but when he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) has ladies to please, every feature works.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton's manners are not perfect," replied Emma; "but where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal. Where a man does his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) best with only moderate powers, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will have the advantage over negligent superiority. There is such perfect good-temper and good-will in Mr. Elton as one cannot but value."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. John Knightley presently, with some slyness, "he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seems to have a great deal of good-will towards you."

<p/>"Me!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) replied with a smile of astonishment, " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>are you imagining me to be Mr. Elton's object?"

<p/>"Such an imagination has crossed me, I own, Emma; and if it never occurred to you before, you may as well take it into consideration now.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>Mr. Elton in love with me! What an idea!"

<p/>"I do not say it is so; but you will do well to consider whether it is so or not, and to regulate your behaviour accordingly. I think your manners to him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) encouraging. I speak as a friend, Emma. You had better look about you, and ascertain what you do, and what you mean to do."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I thank you; but I assure you you are quite mistaken. Mr. Elton and I are very good friends, and nothing more;"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked on, amusing herself in the consideration of the blunders which often arise from a partial knowledge of circumstances, of the mistakes which people of high pretensions to judgment are for ever falling into; and not very well pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother for imagining her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) blind and ignorant, and in want of counsel. He (<font color='blue'><b>counsel</b></font>) said no more.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) eldest daughter in his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.

<p/>Emma soon saw that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) companion was not in the happiest humour. The preparing and the going abroad in such weather, with the sacrifice of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) children after dinner, were evils, were disagreeables at least, which Mr. John Knightley did not by any means like; he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) anticipated nothing in the visit that could be at all worth the purchase; and the whole of their drive to the vicarage was spent by him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) in expressing his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) discontent.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"A man,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), "must have a very good opinion of himself when he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asks people to leave their own fireside, and encounter such a day as this, for the sake of coming to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) must think himself a most agreeable fellow; I could not do such a thing. It is the greatest absurdity Actually snowing at this moment! The folly of not allowing people to be comfortable at home and the folly of people's not staying comfortably at home when they can! If we were obliged to go out such an evening as this, by any call of duty or business, what a hardship we should deem it; and here are we, probably with rather thinner clothing than usual, setting forward voluntarily, without excuse, in defiance of the voice of nature, which tells man, in every thing given to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) view or his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) feelings, to stay at home himself, and keep all under shelter that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can; here are we setting forward to spend five dull hours in another man's house, with nothing to say or to hear that was not said and heard yesterday, and may not be said and heard again to-morrow. Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse; four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home."

<p/>Emma did not find herself equal to give the pleased assent, which no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was in the habit of receiving, to emulate the <div class="bookquote">"Very true, my love,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>which must have been usually administered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) travelling companion; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had resolution enough to refrain from making any answer at all. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not be complying, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dreaded being quarrelsome; her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heroism reached only to silence. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) to talk, and arranged the glasses, and wrapped herself up, without opening her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) lips.

<p/>They arrived, the carriage turned, the step was let down, and Mr. Elton, spruce, black, and smiling, was with them instantly. Emma thought with pleasure of some change of subject. Mr. Elton was all obligation and cheerfulness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was so very cheerful in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) civilities indeed, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) began to think he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) must have received a different account of Harriet from what had reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had sent while dressing, and the answer had been, <div class="bookquote">"Much the same not better."

 (<font color='red'><b>She</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"My report from Mrs. Goddard's,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Goddard</b></font>) presently, "was not so pleasant as I had hoped <div class="bookquote">'Not better'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>was my answer."

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) face lengthened immediately; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) voice was the voice of sentiment as he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) answered.

<p/>"Oh! no I am grieved to find I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned I had flattered myself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) in the morning."

<p/>Emma smiled and answered "My visit was of use to the nervous part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), as you probably heard."

<p/>"Yes I imagined that is I did not "

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) has been used to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!"

<p/>"Dreadful! Exactly so, indeed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will be missed every moment."

<p/>This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What an excellent device,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>), "the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it; impossible to feel cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter. Ha! snows a little I see."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley, "and I think we shall have a good deal of it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Christmas weather,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Elton</b></font>)</div>observed Mr. Elton. "Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se'nnight."

<p/>Mr. John Knightley looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,

<p/>"I cannot wish to be snowed up a week at Randalls."

<p/>At another time Emma might have been amused, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We are sure of excellent fires,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>continued he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>), "and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston; Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society; it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings."

<p/>"I know nothing of the large parties of London, sir I never dine with any body."

<p/>"Indeed! (in a tone of wonder and pity,) I had no idea that the law had been so great a slavery. Well, sir, the time must come when you will be paid for all this, when you will have little labour and great enjoyment."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My first enjoyment,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>replied John Knightley, as they passed through the sweep-gate, "will be to find myself safe at Hartfield again."
