<p/>Mr. Frank Churchill did not come. When the time proposed drew near, Mrs. Weston's fears were justified in the arrival of a letter of excuse. For the present, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) could not be spared, to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) <div class="bookquote">"very great mortification and regret; but still he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) looked forward with the hope of coming to Randalls at no distant period."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Mrs. Weston was exceedingly disappointed much more disappointed, in fact, than her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband, though her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) dependence on seeing the young man had been so much more sober: but a sanguine temper, though for ever expecting more good than occurs, does not always pay for its hopes by any proportionate depression. It soon flies over the present failure, and begins to hope again. For half an hour Mr. Weston was surprized and sorry; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) began to perceive that Frank's coming two or three months later would be a much better plan; better time of year; better weather; and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) would be able, without any doubt, to stay considerably longer with them than if he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had come sooner.

<p/>These feelings rapidly restored his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) comfort, while Mrs. Weston, of a more apprehensive disposition, foresaw nothing but a repetition of excuses and delays; and after all her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) concern for what her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband was to suffer, suffered a great deal more herself.

<p/>Emma was not at this time in a state of spirits to care really about Mr. Frank Churchill's not coming, except as a disappointment at Randalls. The acquaintance at present had no charm for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted, rather, to be quiet, and out of temptation; but still, as it was desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should appear, in general, like her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual self, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) took care to express as much interest in the circumstance, and enter as warmly into Mr. and Mrs. Weston's disappointment, as might naturally belong to their friendship.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was the first to announce it to Mr. Knightley; and exclaimed quite as much as was necessary, (or, being acting a part, perhaps rather more,) at the conduct of the Churchills, in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) then proceeded to say a good deal more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) felt, of the advantage of such an addition to their confined society in Surry; the pleasure of looking at somebody new; the gala-day to Highbury entire, which the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have made; and ending with reflections on the Churchills again, found herself directly involved in a disagreement with Mr. Knightley; and, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) great amusement, perceived that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was taking the other side of the question from her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) real opinion, and making use of Mrs. Weston's arguments against herself.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The Churchills are very likely in fault,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, coolly; <div class="bookquote">"but I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) might come if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div><p/>"I do not know why you should say so. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wishes exceedingly to come; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) uncle and aunt will not spare him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>)."

<p/>"I cannot believe that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not the power of coming, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) made a point of it. It is too unlikely, for me to believe it without proof."

<p/>"How odd you are! What has Mr. Frank Churchill done, to make you suppose him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) such an unnatural creature?"

<p/>"I am not supposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at all an unnatural creature, in suspecting that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may have learnt to be above his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) connexions, and to care very little for any thing but his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) own pleasure, from living with those who have always set him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) the example of it. It is a great deal more natural than one could wish, that a young man, brought up by those who are proud, luxurious, and selfish, should be proud, luxurious, and selfish too. If Frank Churchill had wanted to see his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would have contrived it between September and January. A man at his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) age what is he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)? three or four-and-twenty cannot be without the means of doing as much as that. It is impossible."

<p/>"That's easily said, and easily felt by you, who have always been your own master. You are the worst judge in the world, Mr. Knightley, of the difficulties of dependence. You do not know what it is to have tempers to manage."

<p/>"It is not to be conceived that a man of three or four-and-twenty should not have liberty of mind or limb to that amount. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot want money he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) cannot want leisure. We know, on the contrary, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has so much of both, that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is glad to get rid of them at the idlest haunts in the kingdom. We hear of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) for ever at some watering-place or other. A little while ago, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was at Weymouth. This proves that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can leave the Churchills."

<p/>"Yes, sometimes he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can."

<p/>"And those times are whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) thinks it worth his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) while; whenever there is any temptation of pleasure."

<p/>"It is very unfair to judge of any body's conduct, without an intimate knowledge of their situation. Nobody, who has not been in the interior of a family, can say what the difficulties of any individual of that family may be. We ought to be acquainted with Enscombe, and with Mrs. Churchill's temper, before we pretend to decide upon what her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew can do. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) may, at times, be able to do a great deal more than he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) can at others."

<p/>"There is one thing, Emma, which a man can always do, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) chuses, and that is, his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty; not by manoeuvring and finessing, but by vigour and resolution. It is Frank Churchill's duty to pay this attention to his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) father. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) knows it to be so, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) promises and messages; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wished to do it, it might be done. A man who felt rightly would say at once, simply and resolutely, to Mrs. Churchill 'Every sacrifice of mere pleasure you will always find me ready to make to your convenience; but I must go and see my father immediately. I know he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would be hurt by my failing in such a mark of respect to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) on the present occasion. I shall, therefore, set off to-morrow.' If he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) would say so to her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) at once, in the tone of decision becoming a man, there would be no opposition made to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) going."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing; "but perhaps there might be some made to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) coming back again. Such language for a young man entirely dependent, to use! Nobody but you, Mr. Knightley, would imagine it possible. But you have not an idea of what is requisite in situations directly opposite to your own. Mr. Frank Churchill to be making such a speech as that to the uncle and aunt, who have brought him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) up, and are to provide for him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)! Standing up in the middle of the room, I suppose, and speaking as loud as he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) could! How can you imagine such conduct practicable?"

<p/>"Depend upon it, Emma, a sensible man would find no difficulty in it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would feel himself in the right; and the declaration made, of course, as a man of sense would make it, in a proper manner would do him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) more good, raise him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) higher, fix his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) interest stronger with the people he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) depended on, than all that a line of shifts and expedients can ever do. Respect would be added to affection. They would feel that they could trust him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); that the nephew who had done rightly by his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) father, would do rightly by them; for they know, as well as he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) does, as well as all the world must know, that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) ought to pay this visit to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) father; and while meanly exerting their power to delay it, are in their hearts not thinking the better of him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) for submitting to their whims. Respect for right conduct is felt by every body. If he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would act in this sort of manner, on principle, consistently, regularly, their little minds would bend to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)."

<p/>"I rather doubt that. You are very fond of bending little minds; but where little minds belong to rich people in authority, I think they have a knack of swelling out, till they are quite as unmanageable as great ones. I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you would be able to say and do just what you have been recommending for him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>); and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) gratitude and regard at nought. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it."

<p/>"Then it would not be so strong a sense. If it failed to produce equal exertion, it could not be an equal conviction."

<p/>"Oh, the difference of situation and habit! I wish you would try to understand what an amiable young man may be likely to feel in directly opposing those, whom as child and boy he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) has been looking up to all his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) life."

<p/>"Our amiable young man is a very weak young man, if this be the first occasion of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) carrying through a resolution to do right against the will of others. It ought to have been a habit with him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) by this time, of following his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) duty, instead of consulting expediency. I can allow for the fears of the child, but not of the man. As he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) became rational, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have roused himself and shaken off all that was unworthy in their authority. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to have opposed the first attempt on their side to make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) slight his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father. Had he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) begun as he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought, there would have been no difficulty now."

<p/>"We shall never agree about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)," cried Emma; "but that is nothing extraordinary. I have not the least idea of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) being a weak young man: I feel sure that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) is not. Mr. Weston would not be blind to folly, though in his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own son; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is very likely to have a more yielding, complying, mild disposition than would suit your notions of man's perfection. I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has; and though it may cut him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) off from some advantages, it will secure him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) many others."

<p/>"Yes; all the advantages of sitting still when he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) ought to move, and of leading a life of mere idle pleasure, and fancying himself extremely expert in finding excuses for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can sit down and write a fine flourishing letter, full of professions and falsehoods, and persuade himself that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) has hit upon the very best method in the world of preserving peace at home and preventing his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) father's having any right to complain. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) letters disgust me."

<p/>"Your feelings are singular. They seem to satisfy every body else."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suspect they do not satisfy Mrs. Weston. They hardly can satisfy a woman of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) good sense and quick feelings: standing in a mother's place, but without a mother's affection to blind her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>). It is on her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) account that attention to Randalls is doubly due, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) must doubly feel the omission. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) been a person of consequence herself, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) would have come I dare say; and it would not have signified whether he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did or no. Can you think your friend behindhand in these sort of considerations? Do you suppose she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) does not often say all this to herself? No, Emma, your amiable young man can be amiable only in French, not in English. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) may be very ' (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>amiable,' have very good manners, and be very agreeable; but he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) can have no English delicacy towards the feelings of other people: nothing really amiable about him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/>"You seem determined to think ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Me! not at all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Knightley, rather displeased; "I do not want to think ill of him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). I should be as ready to acknowledge his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) merits as any other man; but I hear of none, except what are merely personal; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) is well-grown and good-looking, with smooth, plausible manners."

<p/>"Well, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) have nothing else to recommend him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will be a treasure at Highbury. We do not often look upon fine young men, well-bred and agreeable. We must not be nice and ask for all the virtues into the bargain. Cannot you imagine, Mr. Knightley, what a sensation his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) coming will produce? There will be but one subject throughout the parishes of Donwell and Highbury; but one interest one object of curiosity; it will be all Mr. Frank Churchill; we shall think and speak of nobody else."

<p/>"You will excuse my being so much over-powered. If I find him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conversable, I shall be glad of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) acquaintance; but if he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is only a chattering coxcomb, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) will not occupy much of my time or thoughts."

<p/>"My idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) can adapt his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) conversation to the taste of every body, and has the power as well as the wish of being universally agreeable. To you, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) will talk of farming; to me, of drawing or music; and so on to every body, having that general information on all subjects which will enable him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to follow the lead, or take the lead, just as propriety may require, and to speak extremely well on each; that is my idea of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And mine,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley warmly, "is, that if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) turn out any thing like it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) will be the most insufferable fellow breathing! What! at three-and-twenty to be the king of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) company the great man the practised politician, who is to read every body's character, and make every body's talents conduce to the display of his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) own superiority; to be dispensing his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) flatteries around, that he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) may make all appear like fools compared with himself! My dear Emma, your own good sense could not endure such a puppy when it came to the point."

<p/>"I will say no more about him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>)," cried Emma, "you turn every thing to evil. We are both prejudiced; you against, I for him (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>); and we have no chance of agreeing till he (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is really here."

<p/>"Prejudiced! I am not prejudiced."

<p/>"But I am very much, and without being at all ashamed of it. My love for Mr. and Mrs. Weston gives me a decided prejudice in his (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) favour."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>king</b></font>) is a person I never think of from one month's end to another,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Knightley</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Knightley, with a degree of vexation, which made Emma immediately talk of something else, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not comprehend why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be angry.

<p/>To take a dislike to a young man, only because he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) appeared to be of a different disposition from himself, was unworthy the real liberality of mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was always used to acknowledge in him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>); for with all the high opinion of himself, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had often laid to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) charge, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had never before for a moment supposed it could make him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) unjust to the merit of another.
