<p/>It was presumed that Mr. Crawford was travelling back, to London, on
the morrow, for nothing more was seen of him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) at Mr. Price’s; and two
days afterwards, it was a fact ascertained to Fanny by the following
letter from his (<font color='blue'><b>Price</b></font>) sister, opened and read by her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), on another account,
with the most anxious curiosity:—

<p/>"I have to inform you, my dearest Fanny, that Henry has been down to
Portsmouth to see you; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had a delightful walk with you to the
dockyard last Saturday, and one still more to be dwelt on the next day,
on the ramparts; when the balmy air, the sparkling sea, and your sweet
looks and conversation were altogether in the most delicious harmony,
and afforded sensations which are to raise ecstasy even in retrospect.
This, as well as I understand, is to be the substance of my
information. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) makes me write, but I do not know what else is to be
communicated, except this said visit to Portsmouth, and these two said
walks, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) introduction to your family, especially to a fair sister
of yours, a fine girl of fifteen, who was of the party on the ramparts,
taking her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) first lesson, I presume, in love. I have not time for
writing much, but it would be out of place if I had, for this is to be
a mere letter of business, penned for the purpose of conveying
necessary information, which could not be delayed without risk of evil.
My dear, dear Fanny, if I had you here, how I would talk to you! You
should listen to me till you were tired, and advise me till you were
still tired more; but it is impossible to put a hundredth part of my
great mind on paper, so I will abstain altogether, and leave you to
guess what you like. I have no news for you. You have politics, of
course; and it would be too bad to plague you with the names of people
and parties that fill up my time. I ought to have sent you an account
of your cousin’s first party, but I was lazy, and now it is too long
ago; suffice it, that everything was just as it ought to be, in a style
that any of her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) connexions must have been gratified to witness, and
that her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) own dress and manners did her (<font color='blue'><b>it</b></font>) the greatest credit. My friend,
Mrs. Fraser, is mad for such a house, and it would not make _me_
miserable. I go to Lady Stornaway after Easter; she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) seems in high
spirits, and very happy. I fancy Lord S. is very good-humoured and
pleasant in his (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) own family, and I do not think him (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) so very ill-looking
as I did—at least, one sees many worse. He (<font color='blue'><b>Lord</b></font>) will not do by the side of
your cousin Edmund. Of the last-mentioned hero, what shall I say? If I
avoided his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) name entirely, it would look suspicious. I will say, then,
that we have seen him (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) two or three times, and that my friends here are
very much struck with his (<font color='blue'><b>hero</b></font>) gentlemanlike appearance. Mrs. Fraser (no bad
judge) declares she (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>) knows but three men in town who have so good a
person, height, and air; and I must confess, when he (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>) dined here the
other day, there were none to compare with him (<font color='blue'><b>judge</b></font>), and we were a party of
sixteen. Luckily there is no distinction of dress nowadays to tell
tales, but—but—but Yours affectionately."

<p/>"I had almost forgot (it was Edmund’s fault: he (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) gets into my head more
than does me good) one very material thing I had to say from Henry and
myself—I mean about our taking you back into Northamptonshire. My dear
little creature, do not stay at Portsmouth to lose your pretty looks.
Those vile sea-breezes are the ruin of beauty and health. My poor aunt
always felt affected if within ten miles of the sea, which the Admiral
of course never believed, but I know it was so. I am at your service
and Henry’s, at an hour’s notice. I should like the scheme, and we
would make a little circuit, and shew you Everingham in our way, and
perhaps you would not mind passing through London, and seeing the
inside of St. George’s, Hanover Square. Only keep your cousin Edmund
from me at such a time: I should not like to be tempted. What a long
letter! one word more. Henry, I find, has some idea of going into
Norfolk again upon some business that _you_ approve; but this cannot
possibly be permitted before the middle of next week; that is, he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
cannot anyhow be spared till after the 14th, for _we_ have a party that
evening. The value of a man like Henry, on such an occasion, is what
you can have no conception of; so you must take it upon my word to be
inestimable. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will see the Rushworths, which I own I am not sorry
for—having a little curiosity, and so I think has he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)—though he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) will not
acknowledge it."

<p/>This was a letter to be run through eagerly, to be read deliberately,
to supply matter for much reflection, and to leave everything in
greater suspense than ever. The only certainty to be drawn from it was,
that nothing decisive had yet taken place. Edmund had not yet spoken.
How Miss Crawford really felt, how she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meant to act, or might act
without or against her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) meaning; whether his (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) were
quite what it had been before the last separation; whether, if
lessened, it were likely to lessen more, or to recover itself, were
subjects for endless conjecture, and to be thought of on that day and
many days to come, without producing any conclusion. The idea that
returned the oftenest was that Miss Crawford, after proving herself
cooled and staggered by a return to London habits, would yet prove
herself in the end too much attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Edmund</b></font>) up. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
try to be more ambitious than her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) heart would allow. She (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would
hesitate, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would tease, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would condition, she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would require a
great deal, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) would finally accept.

<p/>This was Fanny’s most frequent expectation. A house in town—that, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>)
thought, must be impossible. Yet there was no saying what Miss Crawford
might not ask. The prospect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) cousin grew worse and worse. The
woman who could speak of him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>), and speak only of his (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) appearance! What an
unworthy attachment! To be deriving support from the commendations of
Mrs. Fraser! _She (<font color='blue'><b>Fraser</b></font>)_ who had known him (<font color='blue'><b>cousin</b></font>) intimately half a year! Fanny was
ashamed of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>). Those parts of the letter which related only to Mr.
Crawford and herself, touched her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>), in comparison, slightly. Whether Mr.
Crawford went into Norfolk before or after the 14th was certainly no
concern of hers, though, everything considered, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) _would_
go without delay. That Miss Crawford should endeavour to secure a
meeting between him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) and Mrs. Rushworth, was all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) worst line of
conduct, and grossly unkind and ill-judged; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) hoped _he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)_ would
not be actuated by any such degrading curiosity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) acknowledged no
such inducement, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) sister ought to have given him (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>) credit for
better feelings than her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was yet more impatient for another letter from town after receiving
this than she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had been before; and for a few days was so unsettled by
it altogether, by what had come, and what might come, that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) usual
readings and conversation with Susan were much suspended. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) could not
command her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attention as she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) wished. If Mr. Crawford remembered her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
message to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) thought it very likely, most likely, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
would write to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) at all events; it would be most consistent with his (<font color='blue'><b>Crawford</b></font>)
usual kindness; and till she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) got rid of this idea, till it gradually
wore off, by no letters appearing in the course of three or four days
more, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was in a most restless, anxious state.

<p/>At length, a something like composure succeeded. Suspense must be
submitted to, and must not be allowed to wear her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) out, and make her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
useless. Time did something, her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own exertions something more, and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>)
resumed her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) attentions to Susan, and again awakened the same interest
in them.

<p/>Susan was growing very fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Susan</b></font>), and though without any of the early
delight in books which had been so strong in Fanny, with a disposition
much less inclined to sedentary pursuits, or to information for
information’s sake, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) had so strong a desire of not _appearing_
ignorant, as, with a good clear understanding, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) a most
attentive, profitable, thankful pupil. Fanny was her (<font color='blue'><b>Fanny</b></font>) oracle. Fanny’s
explanations and remarks were a most important addition to every essay,
or every
