<p/>Anne had not wanted this visit to Uppercross, to learn that a removal
from one set of people to another, though at a distance of only three
miles, will often include a total change of conversation, opinion, and
idea.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had never been staying there before, without being struck by
it, or without wishing that other Elliots could have her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) advantage in
seeing how unknown, or unconsidered there, were the affairs which at
Kellynch Hall were treated as of such general publicity and pervading
interest; yet, with all this experience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must now
submit to feel that another lesson, in the art of knowing our own
nothingness beyond our own circle, was become necessary for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>); for
certainly, coming as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) did, with a heart full of the subject which
had been completely occupying both houses in Kellynch for many weeks,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had expected rather more curiosity and sympathy than she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found in
the separate but very similar remark of Mr and Mrs Musgrove: <div class="bookquote">"So, Miss
Anne, Sir Walter and your sister are gone; and what part of Bath do you
think they will settle in?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Musgrove</b></font>)</div>and this, without much waiting for an
answer; or in the young ladies' addition of, <div class="bookquote">"I hope we shall be in
Bath in the winter; but remember, papa, if we do go, we must be in a
good situation:  none of your Queen Squares for us!"  (<font color='red'><b>the ladies</b></font>)</div>or in the anxious
supplement from Mary, of--<div class="bookquote">"Upon my word, I shall be pretty well off,
when you are all gone away to be happy at Bath!"

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could only resolve to avoid such self-delusion in future, and think
with heightened gratitude of the extraordinary blessing of having one
such truly sympathising friend as Lady Russell.

<p/>The Mr Musgroves had their own game to guard, and to destroy, their own
horses, dogs, and newspapers to engage them, and the females were fully
occupied in all the other common subjects of housekeeping, neighbours,
dress, dancing, and music.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) acknowledged it to be very fitting,
that every little social commonwealth should dictate its own matters of
discourse; and hoped, ere long, to become a not unworthy member of the
one she (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) was now transplanted into.  With the prospect of spending at
least two months at Uppercross, it was highly incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) to
clothe her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) imagination, her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) memory, and all her (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) ideas in as much of
Uppercross as possible.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Russell</b></font>) had no dread of these two months.  Mary was not so repulsive and
unsisterly as Elizabeth, nor so inaccessible to all influence of hers;
neither was there anything among the other component parts of the
cottage inimical to comfort.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was always on friendly terms with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
brother-in-law; and in the children, who loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nearly as well, and
respected her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) a great deal more than their mother, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had an object of
interest, amusement, and wholesome exertion.

<p/>Charles Musgrove was civil and agreeable; in sense and temper he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was
undoubtedly superior to his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) wife, but not of powers, or conversation,
or grace, to make the past, as they were connected together, at all a
dangerous contemplation; though, at the same time, Anne could believe,
with Lady Russell, that a more equal match might have greatly improved
him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>); and that a woman of real understanding might have given more
consequence to his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) character, and more usefulness, rationality, and
elegance to his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) habits and pursuits.  As it was, he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) did nothing with
much zeal, but sport; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) time was otherwise trifled away, without
benefit from books or anything else.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had very good spirits, which
never seemed much affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) wife's occasional lowness, bore with
her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) unreasonableness sometimes to Anne's admiration, and upon the
whole, though there was very often a little disagreement (in which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>)
had sometimes more share than she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wished, being appealed to by both
parties), they might pass for a happy couple.  They were always
perfectly agreed in the want of more money, and a strong inclination
for a handsome present from his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) father; but here, as on most topics, he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
had the superiority, for while Mary thought it a great shame that such
a present was not made, he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) always contended for his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) father's having
many other uses for his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) money, and a right to spend it as he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) liked.

<p/>As to the management of their children, his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) theory was much better than
his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) wife's, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) practice not so bad.  <div class="bookquote">"I could manage them very
well, if it were not for Mary's interference,"  (<font color='red'><b>Anne/Miss Anne</b></font>)</div>was what Anne often
heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) say, and had a good deal of faith in; but when listening in
turn to Mary's reproach of <div class="bookquote">"Charles spoils the children so that I
cannot get them into any order,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) never had the smallest temptation
to say, <div class="bookquote">"Very true."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>One of the least agreeable circumstances of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) residence there was her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
being treated with too much confidence by all parties, and being too
much in the secret of the complaints of each house.  Known to have some
influence with her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sister, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was continually requested, or at least
receiving hints to exert it, beyond what was practicable.  <div class="bookquote">"I wish you
could persuade Mary not to be always fancying herself ill,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Charles/Charles</b></font>)</div>was
Charles's language; and, in an unhappy mood, thus spoke Mary: "I do
believe if Charles were to see me dying, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) would not think there was
anything the matter with me.  I am sure, Anne, if you would, you might
persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) that I really am very ill--a great deal worse than I ever
own."

<p/>Mary's declaration was, "I hate sending the children to the Great
House, though their grandmamma is always wanting to see them, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
humours and indulges them to such a degree, and gives them so much
trash and sweet things, that they are sure to come back sick and cross
for the rest of the day."  And Mrs Musgrove took the first opportunity
of being alone with Anne, to say, "Oh! Miss Anne, I cannot help wishing
Mrs Charles had a little of your method with those children.  They are
quite different creatures with you!  But to be sure, in general they
are so spoilt!  It is a pity you cannot put your sister in the way of
managing them.  They are as fine healthy children as ever were seen,
poor little dears! without partiality; but Mrs Charles knows no more
how they should be treated--!  Bless me! how troublesome they are
sometimes.  I assure you, Miss Anne, it prevents my wishing to see them
at our house so often as I otherwise should.  I believe Mrs Charles is
not quite pleased with my not inviting them oftener; but you know it is
very bad to have children with one that one is obligated to be checking
every moment; <div class="bookquote">"don't do this,"  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"don't do that;"  (<font color='red'><b>children</b></font>)</div>or that one can
only keep in tolerable order by more cake than is good for them.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had this communication, moreover, from Mary.  " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Musgrove</b></font>)</div>Mrs Musgrove thinks
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) servants so steady, that it would be high treason to call it in
question; but I am sure, without exaggeration, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) upper
house-maid and laundry-maid, instead of being in their business, are
gadding about the village, all day long.  I meet them wherever I go;
and I declare, I never go twice into my nursery without seeing
something of them.  If Jemima were not the trustiest, steadiest
creature in the world, it would be enough to spoil her (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>); for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) tells
me, they are always tempting her (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) to take a walk with them." And on Mrs
Musgrove's side, it was, "I make a rule of never interfering in any of
my daughter-in-law's concerns, for I know it would not do; but I shall
tell you, Miss Anne, because you may be able to set things to rights,
that I have no very good opinion of Mrs Charles's nursery-maid: I hear
strange stories of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>); she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is always upon the gad; and from my own
knowledge, I can declare, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is such a fine-dressing lady, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is
enough to ruin any servants she (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) comes near.  Mrs Charles quite swears
by her (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>), I know; but I just give you this hint, that you may be upon the
watch; because, if you see anything amiss, you need not be afraid of
mentioning it."

<p/>Again, it was Mary's complaint, that Mrs Musgrove was very apt not to
give her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) the precedence that was her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) due, when they dined at the Great
House with other families; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) did not see any reason why she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was
to be considered so much at home as to lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) place.  And one day
when Anne was walking with only the Musgroves, one of them after
talking of rank, people of rank, and jealousy of rank, said, "I have no
scruple of observing to you, how nonsensical some persons are about
their place, because all the world knows how easy and indifferent you
are about it; but I wish anybody could give Mary a hint that it would
be a great deal better if she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) were not so very tenacious, especially if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) would not be always putting herself forward to take place of mamma.
Nobody doubts her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) right to have precedence of mamma, but it would be
more becoming in her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) not to be always insisting on it.  It is not that
mamma cares about it the least in the world, but I know it is taken
notice of by many persons."

<p/>How was Anne to set all these matters to rights?  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could do little
more than listen patiently, soften every grievance, and excuse each to
the other; give them all hints of the forbearance necessary between
such near neighbours, and make those hints broadest which were meant
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) sister's benefit.

<p/>In all other respects, her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) visit began and proceeded very well.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
own spirits improved by change of place and subject, by being removed
three miles from Kellynch; Mary's ailments lessened by having a
constant companion, and their daily intercourse with the other family,
since there was neither superior affection, confidence, nor employment
in the cottage, to be interrupted by it, was rather an advantage.  It
was certainly carried nearly as far as possible, for they met every
morning, and hardly ever spent an evening asunder; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) believed
they should not have done so well without the sight of Mr and Mrs
Musgrove's respectable forms in the usual places, or without the
talking, laughing, and singing of their daughters.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) played a great deal better than either of the Miss Musgroves, but
having no voice, no knowledge of the harp, and no fond parents, to sit
by and fancy themselves delighted, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) performance was little thought
of, only out of civility, or to refresh the others, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was well
aware.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) knew that when she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) played she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was giving pleasure only to
herself; but this was no new sensation.  Excepting one short period of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) life, she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had never, since the age of fourteen, never since the
loss of her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) dear mother, known the happiness of being listened to, or
encouraged by any just appreciation or real taste.  In music she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had
been always used to feel alone in the world; and Mr and Mrs Musgrove's
fond partiality for their own daughters' performance, and total
indifference to any other person's, gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) much more pleasure for
their sakes, than mortification for her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own.

<p/>The party at the Great House was sometimes increased by other company.
The neighbourhood was not large, but the Musgroves were visited by
everybody, and had more dinner-parties, and more callers, more visitors
by invitation and by chance, than any other family.  They were more
completely popular.

<p/>The girls were wild for dancing; and the evenings ended, occasionally,
in an unpremeditated little ball.  There was a family of cousins within
a walk of Uppercross, in less affluent circumstances, who depended on
the Musgroves for all their pleasures:  they would come at any time,
and help play at anything, or dance anywhere; and Anne, very much
preferring the office of musician to a more active post, played country
dances to them by the hour together; a kindness which always
recommended her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) musical powers to the notice of Mr and Mrs Musgrove
more than anything else, and often drew this compliment;--"Well done,
Miss Anne! very well done indeed!  Lord bless me!  how those little
fingers of yours fly about!"

<p/>So passed the first three weeks.  Michaelmas came; and now Anne's heart
must be in Kellynch again.  A beloved home made over to others; all the
precious rooms and furniture, groves, and prospects, beginning to own
other eyes and other limbs!  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not think of much else on the
29th of September; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had this sympathetic touch in the evening
from Mary, who, on having occasion to note down the day of the month,
exclaimed, "Dear me, is not this the day the Crofts were to come to
Kellynch?  I am glad I did not think of it before.  How low it makes
me!"

<p/>The Crofts took possession with true naval alertness, and were to be
visited.  Mary deplored the necessity for herself.  "Nobody knew how
much she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should suffer.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) should put it off as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could;"
but was not easy till she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had talked Charles into driving her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) over on
an early day, and was in a very animated, comfortable state of
imaginary agitation, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) came back.  Anne had very sincerely
rejoiced in there being no means of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) going.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wished, however to
see the Crofts, and was glad to be within when the visit was returned.
They came:  the master of the house was not at home, but the two
sisters were together; and as it chanced that Mrs Croft fell to the
share of Anne, while the Admiral sat by Mary, and made himself very
agreeable by his (<font color='blue'><b>Admiral</b></font>) good-humoured notice of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) little boys, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was well
able to watch for a likeness, and if it failed her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) in the features, to
catch it in the voice, or in the turn of sentiment and expression.

<p/>Mrs Croft, though neither tall nor fat, had a squareness, uprightness,
and vigour of form, which gave importance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) person.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had
bright dark eyes, good teeth, and altogether an agreeable face; though
her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) reddened and weather-beaten complexion, the consequence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
having been almost as much at sea as her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) husband, made her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) seem to have
lived some years longer in the world than her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) real eight-and-thirty.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) manners were open, easy, and decided, like one who had no distrust
of herself, and no doubts of what to do; without any approach to
coarseness, however, or any want of good humour.  Anne gave her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) credit,
indeed, for feelings of great consideration towards herself, in all
that related to Kellynch, and it pleased her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>): especially, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had
satisfied herself in the very first half minute, in the instant even of
introduction, that there was not the smallest symptom of any knowledge
or suspicion on Mrs Croft's side, to give a bias of any sort.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) was
quite easy on that head, and consequently full of strength and courage,
till for a moment electrified by Mrs Croft's suddenly saying,--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It was you, and not your sister, I find, that my brother had the
pleasure of being acquainted with, when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was in this country."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft</b></font>)</div><p/>Anne hoped she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) certainly had not.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Perhaps you may not have heard that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) is married?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs Croft</b></font>)</div>added Mrs Croft.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) could now answer as she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) ought; and was happy to feel, when Mrs
Croft's next words explained it to be Mr Wentworth of whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) spoke,
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) had said nothing which might not do for either brother. She (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
immediately felt how reasonable it was, that Mrs Croft should be
thinking and speaking of Edward, and not of Frederick; and with shame
at her (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>) own forgetfulness applied herself to the knowledge of their
former neighbour's present state with proper interest.

<p/>The rest was all tranquillity; till, just as they were moving, she (<font color='blue'><b>Croft</b></font>)
heard the Admiral say to Mary--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We are expecting a brother of Mrs Croft's here soon; I dare say you
know him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) by name."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) was cut short by the eager attacks of the little boys, clinging to
him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) like an old friend, and declaring he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) should not go; and being too
much engrossed by proposals of carrying them away in his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coat pockets,
&c., to have another moment for finishing or recollecting what he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had
begun, Anne was left to persuade herself, as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could, that
the same brother must still be in question.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not, however,
reach such a degree of certainty, as not to be anxious to hear whether
anything had been said on the subject at the other house, where the
Crofts had previously been calling.

<p/>The folks of the Great House were to spend the evening of this day at
the Cottage; and it being now too late in the year for such visits to
be made on foot, the coach was beginning to be listened for, when the
youngest Miss Musgrove walked in.  That she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was coming to apologize,
and that they should have to spend the evening by themselves, was the
first black idea; and Mary was quite ready to be affronted, when Louisa
made all right by saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) only came on foot, to leave more
room for the harp, which was bringing in the carriage.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And I will tell you our reason,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) added, "and all about it.  I am
come on to give you notice, that papa and mamma are out of spirits this
evening, especially mamma; she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) is thinking so much of poor Richard!
And we agreed it would be best to have the harp, for it seems to amuse
her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) more than the piano-forte.  I will tell you why she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) is out of
spirits.  When the Crofts called this morning, (they called here
afterwards, did not they?), they happened to say, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) brother,
Captain Wentworth, is just returned to England, or paid off, or
something, and is coming to see them almost directly; and most
unluckily it came into mamma's head, when they were gone, that
Wentworth, or something very like it, was the name of poor Richard's
captain at one time; I do not know when or where, but a great while
before he (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) died, poor fellow!  And upon looking over his (<font color='blue'><b>Richard</b></font>) letters and
things, she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) found it was so, and is perfectly sure that this must be
the very man, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) head is quite full of it, and of poor Richard!
So we must be as merry as we can, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) may not be dwelling upon
such gloomy things."

<p/>The real circumstances of this pathetic piece of family history were,
that the Musgroves had had the ill fortune of a very troublesome,
hopeless son; and the good fortune to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) reached his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
twentieth year; that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been sent to sea because he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) was stupid and
unmanageable on shore; that he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had been very little cared for at any
time by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) family, though quite as much as he (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) deserved; seldom heard
of, and scarcely at all regretted, when the intelligence of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) death
abroad had worked its way to Uppercross, two years before.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) had, in fact, though his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) sisters were now doing all they could for
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), by calling him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) "poor Richard," been nothing better than a
thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done
anything to entitle himself to more than the abbreviation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) name,
living or dead.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had been several years at sea, and had, in the course of those
removals to which all midshipmen are liable, and especially such
midshipmen as every captain wishes to get rid of, been six months on
board Captain Frederick Wentworth's frigate, the Laconia; and from the
Laconia he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had, under the influence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) captain, written the only
two letters which his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) father and mother had ever received from him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
during the whole of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) absence; that is to say, the only two
disinterested letters; all the rest had been mere applications for
money.

<p/>In each letter he (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) had spoken well of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) captain; but yet, so little
were they in the habit of attending to such matters, so unobservant and
incurious were they as to the names of men or ships, that it had made
scarcely any impression at the time; and that Mrs Musgrove should have
been suddenly struck, this very day, with a recollection of the name of
Wentworth, as connected with her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) son, seemed one of those extraordinary
bursts of mind which do sometimes occur.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had gone to her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) letters, and found it all as she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) supposed; and the
re-perusal of these letters, after so long an interval, her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) poor son
gone for ever, and all the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) faults forgotten, had
affected her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) spirits exceedingly, and thrown her (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) into greater grief for
him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) than she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) had known on first hearing of his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) death.  Mr Musgrove was,
in a lesser degree, affected likewise; and when they reached the
cottage, they were evidently in want, first, of being listened to anew
on this subject, and afterwards, of all the relief which cheerful
companions could give them.

<p/>To hear them talking so much of Captain Wentworth, repeating his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) name
so often, puzzling over past years, and at last ascertaining that it
might, that it probably would, turn out to be the very same Captain
Wentworth whom they recollected meeting, once or twice, after their
coming back from Clifton--a very fine young man--but they could not say
whether it was seven or eight years ago, was a new sort of trial to
Anne's nerves.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found, however, that it was one to which she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
inure herself.  Since he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) actually was expected in the country, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) must
teach herself to be insensible on such points.  And not only did it
appear that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was expected, and speedily, but the Musgroves, in their
warm gratitude for the kindness he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had shewn poor Dick, and very high
respect for his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character, stamped as it was by poor Dick's having been
six months under his (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) care, and mentioning him (<font color='blue'><b>Dick</b></font>) in strong, though not
