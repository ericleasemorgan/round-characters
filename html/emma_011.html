<p/>Mr. Elton must now be left to himself. It was no longer in Emma's power to superintend his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) happiness or quicken his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) measures. The coming of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sister's family was so very near at hand, that first in anticipation, and then in reality, it became henceforth her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prime object of interest; and during the ten days of their stay at Hartfield it was not to be expected she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) did not herself expect that any thing beyond occasional, fortuitous assistance could be afforded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to the lovers. They might advance rapidly if they would, however; they must advance somehow or other whether they would or no. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hardly wished to have more leisure for them. There are people, who the more you do for them, the less they will do for themselves.

<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, from having been longer than usual absent from Surry, were exciting of course rather more than the usual interest. Till this year, every long vacation since their marriage had been divided between Hartfield and Donwell Abbey; but all the holidays of this autumn had been given to sea-bathing for the children, and it was therefore many months since they had been seen in a regular way by their Surry connexions, or seen at all by Mr. Woodhouse, who could not be induced to get so far as London, even for poor Isabella's sake; and who consequently was now most nervously and apprehensively happy in forestalling this too short visit.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) thought much of the evils of the journey for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and not a little of the fatigues of his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) own horses and coachman who were to bring some of the party the last half of the way; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms were needless; the sixteen miles being happily accomplished, and Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley, their five children, and a competent number of nursery-maids, all reaching Hartfield in safety. The bustle and joy of such an arrival, the many to be talked to, welcomed, encouraged, and variously dispersed and disposed of, produced a noise and confusion which his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) nerves could not have borne under any other cause, nor have endured much longer even for this; but the ways of Hartfield and the feelings of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father were so respected by Mrs. John Knightley, that in spite of maternal solicitude for the immediate enjoyment of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) little ones, and for their having instantly all the liberty and attendance, all the eating and drinking, and sleeping and playing, which they could possibly wish for, without the smallest delay, the children were never allowed to be long a disturbance to him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), either in themselves or in any restless attendance on them.

<p/>Mrs. John Knightley was a pretty, elegant little woman, of gentle, quiet manners, and a disposition remarkably amiable and affectionate; wrapt up in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) family; a devoted wife, a doating mother, and so tenderly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father and sister that, but for these higher ties, a warmer love might have seemed impossible. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could never see a fault in any of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not a woman of strong understanding or any quickness; and with this resemblance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father, she (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) inherited also much of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) constitution; was delicate in her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own health, over-careful of that of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) children, had many fears and many nerves, and was as fond of her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own Mr. Wingfield in town as her (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father could be of Mr. Perry. They were alike too, in a general benevolence of temper, and a strong habit of regard for every old acquaintance.

<p/>Mr. John Knightley was a tall, gentleman-like, and very clever man; rising in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) profession, domestic, and respectable in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) private character; but with reserved manners which prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being generally pleasing; and capable of being sometimes out of humour. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not an ill-tempered man, not so often unreasonably cross as to deserve such a reproach; but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) temper was not his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) great perfection; and, indeed, with such a worshipping wife, it was hardly possible that any natural defects in it should not be increased. The extreme sweetness of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) temper must hurt his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had all the clearness and quickness of mind which she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) wanted, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could sometimes act an ungracious, or say a severe thing.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was not a great favourite with his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) fair sister-in-law. Nothing wrong in him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) escaped her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was quick in feeling the little injuries to Isabella, which Isabella never felt herself. Perhaps she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) might have passed over more had his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners been flattering to Isabella's sister, but they were only those of a calmly kind brother and friend, without praise and without blindness; but hardly any degree of personal compliment could have made her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) regardless of that greatest fault of all in her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) eyes which he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) sometimes fell into, the want of respectful forbearance towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father. There he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had not always the patience that could have been wished. Mr. Woodhouse's peculiarities and fidgetiness were sometimes provoking him (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to a rational remonstrance or sharp retort equally ill-bestowed. It did not often happen; for Mr. John Knightley had really a great regard for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) father-in-law, and generally a strong sense of what was due to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); but it was too often for Emma's charity, especially as there was all the pain of apprehension frequently to be endured, though the offence came not. The beginning, however, of every visit displayed none but the properest feelings, and this being of necessity so short might be hoped to pass away in unsullied cordiality. They had not been long seated and composed when Mr. Woodhouse, with a melancholy shake of the head and a sigh, called his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter's attention to the sad change at Hartfield since she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) had been there last.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ah, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"poor Miss Taylor It is a grievous business."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh yes, sir,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>cried she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) with ready sympathy, "how you must miss her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>)! And dear Emma, too! What a dreadful loss to you both! I have been so grieved for you. I could not imagine how you could possibly do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). It is a sad change indeed. But I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is pretty well, sir."

<p/>"Pretty well, my dear I hope pretty well. I do not know but that the place agrees with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tolerably.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mr. John Knightley here asked Emma quietly whether there were any doubts of the air of Randalls.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! no none in the least. I never saw Mrs. Weston better in my life never looking so well. Papa is only speaking his (<font color='blue'><b>Papa</b></font>) own regret."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Very much to the honour of both,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was the handsome reply.

<p/>"And do you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), sir, tolerably often?" asked Isabella in the plaintive tone which just suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) father.

<p/>Mr. Woodhouse hesitated. <div class="bookquote">"Not near so often, my dear, as I could wish."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! papa, we have missed seeing them but one entire day since they married. Either in the morning or evening of every day, excepting one, have we seen either Mr. Weston or Mrs. Weston, and generally both, either at Randalls or here and as you may suppose, Isabella, most frequently here. They are very, very kind in their visits. Mr. Weston is really as kind as herself. Papa, if you speak in that melancholy way, you will be giving Isabella a false idea of us all. Every body must be aware that Miss Taylor must be missed, but every body ought also to be assured that Mr. and Mrs. Weston do really prevent our missing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) by any means to the extent we ourselves anticipated which is the exact truth."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Just as it should be,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said Mr. John Knightley, "and just as I hoped it was from your letters. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of shewing you attention could not be doubted, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) being a disengaged and social man makes it all easy. I have been always telling you, my love, that I had no idea of the change being so very material to Hartfield as you apprehended; and now you have Emma's account, I hope you will be satisfied."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Why, to be sure,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Woodhouse "yes, certainly I cannot deny that Mrs. Weston, poor Mrs. Weston, does come and see us pretty often but then she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is always obliged to go away again."

<p/>"It would be very hard upon Mr. Weston if she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) did not, papa. You quite forget poor Mr. Weston."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I think, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley pleasantly, "that Mr. Weston has some little claim. You and I, Emma, will venture to take the part of the poor husband. I, being a husband, and you not being a wife, the claims of the man may very likely strike us with equal force. As for Isabella, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) has been married long enough to see the convenience of putting all the Mr. Westons aside as much as she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) can."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Me, my love,"  (<font color='red'><b>wife hearing understanding</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wife, hearing and understanding only in part.  "Are you talking about me? I am sure nobody ought to be, or can be, a greater advocate for matrimony than I am; and if it had not been for the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) leaving Hartfield, I should never have thought of Miss Taylor but as the most fortunate woman in the world; and as to slighting Mr. Weston, that excellent Mr. Weston, I think there is nothing he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) does not deserve. I believe he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is one of the very best-tempered men that ever existed. Excepting yourself and your brother, I do not know his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) equal for temper. I shall never forget his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) flying Henry's kite for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) that very windy day last Easter and ever since his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) particular kindness last September twelvemonth in writing that note, at twelve o'clock at night, on purpose to assure me that there was no scarlet fever at Cobham, I have been convinced there could not be a more feeling heart nor a better man in existence. If any body can deserve him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), it must be Miss Taylor."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Where is the young man?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. John Knightley/John Knightley/John</b></font>)</div>said John Knightley. "Has he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) been here on this occasion or has he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) not?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) has not been here yet,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma. "There was a strong expectation of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) coming soon after the marriage, but it ended in nothing; and I have not heard him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mentioned lately."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But you should tell them of the letter, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father. "He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wrote a letter to poor Mrs. Weston, to congratulate her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), and a very proper, handsome letter it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) shewed it to me. I thought it very well done of him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) indeed. Whether it was his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) own idea you know, one cannot tell. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is but young, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) uncle, perhaps "

<p/>"My dear papa, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is three-and-twenty. You forget how time passes."

<p/>"Three-and-twenty! is he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) indeed? Well, I could not have thought it and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was but two years old when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) lost his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) poor mother! Well, time does fly indeed! and my memory is very bad. However, it was an exceeding good, pretty letter, and gave Mr. and Mrs. Weston a great deal of pleasure. I remember it was written from Weymouth, and dated Sept. 28th and began, <div class="bookquote">'My dear Madam,'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>but I forget how it went on; and it was signed <div class="bookquote">'F. C. Weston Churchill.'  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I remember that perfectly."

<p/>"How very pleasing and proper of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>)!<div class="bookquote">" cried the good-hearted Mrs. John Knightley. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) being a most amiable young man. But how sad it is that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) should not live at home with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) father! There is something so shocking in a child's being taken away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) parents and natural home! I never could comprehend how Mr. Weston could part with him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>). To give up one's child! I really never could think well of any body who proposed such a thing to any body else."

<p/>"Nobody ever did think well of the Churchills, I fancy,<div class="bookquote">" observed Mr. John Knightley coolly. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>But you need not imagine Mr. Weston to have felt what you would feel in giving up Henry or John. Mr. Weston is rather an easy, cheerful-tempered man, than a man of strong feelings; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) takes things as he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) finds them, and makes enjoyment of them somehow or other, depending, I suspect, much more upon what is called society for his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) comforts, that is, upon the power of eating and drinking, and playing whist with his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) neighbours five times a week, than upon family affection, or any thing that home affords."

<p/>Emma could not like what bordered on a reflection on Mr. Weston, and had half a mind to take it up; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) struggled, and let it pass. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would keep the peace if possible; and there was something honourable and valuable in the strong domestic habits, the all-sufficiency of home to himself, whence resulted her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) brother's disposition to look down on the common rate of social intercourse, and those to whom it was important. It had a high claim to forbearance.
