<p/>A few days after this visit, Mr. Bingley called again, and alone.
His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend had left him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) that morning for London, but was to
return home in ten days time. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sat with them above an hour, and
was in remarkably good spirits. Mrs. Bennet invited him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to dine
with them; but, with many expressions of concern, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) confessed
himself engaged elsewhere.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Next time you call,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I hope we shall be more lucky."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should be particularly happy at any time, etc. etc.; and if
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) would give him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) leave, would take an early opportunity of
waiting on them.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Can you come to-morrow?"

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>Yes, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no engagement at all for to-morrow; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
invitation was accepted with alacrity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of
them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter’s room, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
dressing gown, and with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hair half finished, crying out:

<p/>"My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is come—Mr. Bingley
is come. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is, indeed. Make haste, make haste. Here, Sarah, come
to Miss Bennet this moment, and help her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) on with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) gown. Never
mind Miss Lizzy’s hair."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We will be down as soon as we can,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane; "but I dare say
Kitty is forwarder than either of us, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) went up stairs half
an hour ago."

<p/>"Oh! hang Kitty! what has she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) to do with it? Come be quick, be
quick! Where is your sash, my dear?"

<p/>But when her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) mother was gone, Jane would not be prevailed on to
go down without one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sisters.

<p/>The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in
the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was
his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) custom, and Mary went up stairs to her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) instrument. Two
obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking
and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time,
without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not
observe her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and when at last Kitty did, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) very innocently
said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me
for? What am I to do?"

<p/>"Nothing child, nothing. I did not wink at you." She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) then sat
still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious
occasion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here,
my love, I want to speak to you," took her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) out of the room. Jane
instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) distress at
such premeditation, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) entreaty that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ would not give in
to it. In a few minutes, Mrs. Bennet half-opened the door and
called out:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lizzy, my dear, I want to speak with you."

 (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth was forced to go.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"We may as well leave them by themselves you know;"  (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was in the hall. <div class="bookquote">"Kitty and I are going up
stairs to sit in my dressing-room."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Elizabeth made no attempt to reason with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, but remained
quietly in the hall, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and Kitty were out of sight, then
returned into the drawing-room.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet’s schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was
every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
daughter. His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) ease and cheerfulness rendered him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) a most agreeable
addition to their evening party; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) bore with the ill-judged
officiousness of the mother, and heard all her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) silly remarks with
a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to
the daughter.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper; and before he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
went away, an engagement was formed, chiefly through his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own and
Mrs. Bennet’s means, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) coming next morning to shoot with
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband.

<p/>After this day, Jane said no more of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) indifference. Not a word
passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went
to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded,
unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously,
however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have
taken place with that gentleman’s concurrence.

<p/>Bingley was punctual to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) appointment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and Mr. Bennet
spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was
much more agreeable than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) companion expected. There was
nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
ridicule, or disgust him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) into silence; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was more
communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen
him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). Bingley of course returned with him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) to dinner; and in the
evening Mrs. Bennet’s invention was again at work to get every
body away from him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter
to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon
after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not be wanted to counteract her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s schemes.

<p/>But on returning to the drawing-room, when her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) letter was
finished, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw, to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) infinite surprise, there was reason to
fear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother had been too ingenious for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). On opening
the door, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) perceived her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister and Bingley standing together
over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had
this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily
turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it
all. _Their_ situation was awkward enough; but _hers_ she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) thought
was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and
Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who
as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering
a few words to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, ran out of the room.

<p/>Jane could have no reserves from Elizabeth, where confidence
would give pleasure; and instantly embracing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), acknowledged,
with the liveliest emotion, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was the happiest creature in
the world.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"’Tis too much!"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) added, "by far too much. I do not deserve
it. Oh! why is not everybody as happy?"

<p/>Elizabeth’s congratulations were given with a sincerity, a
warmth, a delight, which words could but poorly express. Every
sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to Jane. But
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would not allow herself to stay with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) sister, or say half
that remained to be said for the present.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I must go instantly to my mother;"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cried. "I would not on
any account trifle with her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) affectionate solicitude; or allow her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>)
to hear it from anyone but myself. He (<font color='blue'><b>myself</b></font>) is gone to my father
already. Oh! Lizzy, to know that what I have to relate will give
such pleasure to all my dear family! how shall I bear so much
happiness!"

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) then hastened away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) mother, who had purposely broken up
the card party, and was sitting up stairs with Kitty.

<p/>Elizabeth, who was left by herself, now smiled at the rapidity
and ease with which an affair was finally settled, that had given
them so many previous months of suspense and vexation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And this,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), "is the end of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) friend’s anxious
circumspection! of all his (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) sister’s falsehood and contrivance!
the happiest, wisest, most reasonable end!<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>In a few minutes she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was joined by Bingley, whose conference with
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) father had been short and to the purpose.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Where is your sister?" said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) hastily, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) opened the door.

<p/>"With my mother up stairs. She (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) will be down in a moment, I dare
say."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) then shut the door, and, coming up to her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>), claimed the good
wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily
expressed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) delight in the prospect of their relationship. They
shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister came
down, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had to listen to all he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had to say of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own
happiness, and of Jane’s perfections; and in spite of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) being a
lover, Elizabeth really believed all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) expectations of felicity
to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the
excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane,
and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) and
himself.

<p/>It was an evening of no common delight to them all; the
satisfaction of Miss Bennet’s mind gave a glow of such sweet
animation to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) face, as made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) look handsomer than ever.
Kitty simpered and smiled, and hoped her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) turn was coming soon.
Mrs. Bennet could not give her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) consent or speak her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) approbation
in terms warm enough to satisfy her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) feelings, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) talked
to Bingley of nothing else for half an hour; and when Mr. Bennet
joined them at supper, his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) voice and manner plainly showed how
really happy he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was.

<p/>Not a word, however, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) lips in allusion to it, till
their visitor took his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) leave for the night; but as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was
gone, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) turned to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughter, and said:

<p/>"Jane, I congratulate you. You will be a very happy woman.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane went to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) instantly, kissed him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), and thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
goodness.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>a girl</b></font>)</div>You are a good girl;" he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, "and I have great pleasure in
thinking you will be so happily settled. I have not a doubt of
your doing very well together. Your tempers are by no means
unlike. You are each of you so complying, that nothing will ever
be resolved on; so easy, that every servant will cheat you; and
so generous, that you will always exceed your income."

<p/>"I hope not so. Imprudence or thoughtlessness in money matters
would be unpardonable in _me_."

<p/>"Exceed their income! My dear Mr. Bennet,<div class="bookquote">" cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>what
are you talking of? Why, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) has four or five thousand a year, and
very likely more.<div class="bookquote">" Then addressing her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) daughter, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! my dear,
dear Jane, I am so happy! I am sure I shan’t get a wink of sleep
all night. I knew how it would be. I always said it must be so,
at last. I was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing! I
remember, as soon as ever I saw him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) first came into
Hertfordshire last year, I thought how likely it was that you
should come together. Oh! he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) is the handsomest young man that
ever was seen!"

<p/>Wickham, Lydia, were all forgotten. Jane was beyond competition
her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) favourite child. At that moment, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) cared for no other. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
younger sisters soon began to make interest with her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) for objects
of happiness which she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might in future be able to dispense.

<p/>Mary petitioned for the use of the library at Netherfield; and
Kitty begged very hard for a few balls there every winter.

<p/>Bingley, from this time, was of course a daily visitor at
Longbourn; coming frequently before breakfast, and always
remaining till after supper; unless when some barbarous
neighbour, who could not be enough detested, had given him (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) an
invitation to dinner which he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) thought himself obliged to accept.

<p/>Elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister; for while he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) was present, Jane had no attention to bestow
on anyone else; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) found herself considerably useful to both
of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur.
In the absence of Jane, he (<font color='blue'><b>visitor</b></font>) always attached himself to Elizabeth,
for the pleasure of talking of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>); and when Bingley was gone,
Jane constantly sought the same means of relief.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) has made me so happy,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), one evening, "by telling me
that he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was totally ignorant of my being in town last spring! I
had not believed it possible."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I suspected as much,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth. "But how did he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) account
for it?"

<p/>"It must have been his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sister’s doing. They were certainly no
friends to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) acquaintance with me, which I cannot wonder at,
since he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might have chosen so much more advantageously in many
respects. But when they see, as I trust they will, that their
brother is happy with me, they will learn to be contented, and we
shall be on good terms again; though we can never be what we once
were to each other."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is the most unforgiving speech,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "that I
ever heard you utter. Good girl! It would vex me, indeed, to see
you again the dupe of Miss Bingley’s pretended regard."

<p/>"Would you believe it, Lizzy, that when he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) went to town last
November, he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) really loved me, and nothing but a persuasion of
_my_ being indifferent would have prevented his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) coming down
again!"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) made a little mistake to be sure; but it is to the credit of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) modesty."

<p/>This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
diffidence, and the little value he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) put on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) own good
qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) had not betrayed
the interference of his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) friend; for, though Jane had the most
generous and forgiving heart in the world, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew it was a
circumstance which must prejudice her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) against him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed!"
 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>cried Jane. "Oh! Lizzy, why am I thus singled from my family, and
blessed above them all! If I could but see you as happy! If there
were but such another man for you!"

<p/>"If you were to give me forty such men, I never could be so happy
as you. Till I have your disposition, your goodness, I never can
have your happiness. No, no, let me shift for myself; and,
perhaps, if I have very good luck, I may meet with another Mr.
Collins in time."

<p/>The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be
long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs.
Phillips, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) ventured, without any permission, to do the
same by all her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) neighbours in Meryton.

<p/>The Bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in
the world, though only a few weeks before, when Lydia had first
run away, they had been generally proved to be marked out for
misfortune.
