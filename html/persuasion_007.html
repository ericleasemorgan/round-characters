<p/>A very few days more, and Captain Wentworth was known to be at
Kellynch, and Mr Musgrove had called on him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>), and come back warm in his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
praise, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) was engaged with the Crofts to dine at Uppercross, by
the end of another week.  It had been a great disappointment to Mr
Musgrove to find that no earlier day could be fixed, so impatient was
he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) gratitude, by seeing Captain Wentworth under his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) own
roof, and welcoming him (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) to all that was strongest and best in his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>)
cellars.  But a week must pass; only a week, in Anne's reckoning, and
then, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) supposed, they must meet; and soon she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) began to wish that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
could feel secure even for a week.

<p/>Captain Wentworth made a very early return to Mr Musgrove's civility,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was all but calling there in the same half hour.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) and Mary
were actually setting forward for the Great House, where, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
afterwards learnt, they must inevitably have found him (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>), when they were
stopped by the eldest boy's being at that moment brought home in
consequence of a bad fall.  The child's situation put the visit
entirely aside; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not hear of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) escape with indifference,
even in the midst of the serious anxiety which they afterwards felt on
his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) account.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) collar-bone was found to be dislocated, and such injury received in
the back, as roused the most alarming ideas.  It was an afternoon of
distress, and Anne had every thing to do at once; the apothecary to
send for, the father to have pursued and informed, the mother to
support and keep from hysterics, the servants to control, the youngest
child to banish, and the poor suffering one to attend and soothe;
besides sending, as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) recollected it, proper notice to the
other house, which brought her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) an accession rather of frightened,
enquiring companions, than of very useful assistants.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) brother's return was the first comfort; he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) could take best care of
his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) wife; and the second blessing was the arrival of the apothecary.
Till he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) came and had examined the child, their apprehensions were the
worse for being vague; they suspected great injury, but knew not where;
but now the collar-bone was soon replaced, and though Mr Robinson felt
and felt, and rubbed, and looked grave, and spoke low words both to the
father and the aunt, still they were all to hope the best, and to be
able to part and eat their dinner in tolerable ease of mind; and then
it was, just before they parted, that the two young aunts were able so
far to digress from their nephew's state, as to give the information of
Captain Wentworth's visit; staying five minutes behind their father and
mother, to endeavour to express how perfectly delighted they were with
him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), how much handsomer, how infinitely more agreeable they thought him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
than any individual among their male acquaintance, who had been at all
a favourite before.  How glad they had been to hear papa invite him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) to
stay dinner, how sorry when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) said it was quite out of his (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) power, and
how glad again when he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had promised in reply to papa and mamma's
farther pressing invitations to come and dine with them on the
morrow--actually on the morrow; and he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had promised it in so pleasant a
manner, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) felt all the motive of their attention just as he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>)
ought.  And in short, he (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>) had looked and said everything with such
exquisite grace, that they could assure them all, their heads were both
turned by him (<font color='blue'><b>papa</b></font>); and off they ran, quite as full of glee as of love, and
apparently more full of Captain Wentworth than of little Charles.

<p/>The same story and the same raptures were repeated, when the two girls
came with their father, through the gloom of the evening, to make
enquiries; and Mr Musgrove, no longer under the first uneasiness about
his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) heir, could add his (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) confirmation and praise, and hope there would
be now no occasion for putting Captain Wentworth off, and only be sorry
to think that the cottage party, probably, would not like to leave the
little boy, to give him (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) the meeting.  <div class="bookquote">"Oh no; as to leaving the little
boy,"  (<font color='red'><b>both father mother</b></font>)</div>both father and mother were in much too strong and recent alarm
to bear the thought; and Anne, in the joy of the escape, could not help
adding her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) warm protestations to theirs.

<p/>Charles Musgrove, indeed, afterwards, shewed more of inclination; <div class="bookquote">"the
child was going on so well, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Musgrove</b></font>) wished so much to be introduced to
Captain Wentworth, that, perhaps, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might join them in the evening; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
would not dine from home, but he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) might walk in for half an hour."  (<font color='red'><b>Charles/Charles Musgrove</b></font>)</div>But
in this he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was eagerly opposed by his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wife, with "Oh! no, indeed,
Charles, I cannot bear to have you go away.  Only think if anything
should happen?"

<p/>The child had a good night, and was going on well the next day.  It
must be a work of time to ascertain that no injury had been done to the
spine; but Mr Robinson found nothing to increase alarm, and Charles
Musgrove began, consequently, to feel no necessity for longer
confinement.  The child was to be kept in bed and amused as quietly as
possible; but what was there for a father to do?  This was quite a
female case, and it would be highly absurd in him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), who could be of no
use at home, to shut himself up.  His (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) father very much wished him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
meet Captain Wentworth, and there being no sufficient reason against
it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) ought to go; and it ended in his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) making a bold, public
declaration, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) came in from shooting, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) meaning to dress
directly, and dine at the other house.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nothing can be going on better than the child,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>); "so I told my
father, just now, that I would come, and he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thought me quite right.
Your sister being with you, my love, I have no scruple at all.  You
would not like to leave him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) yourself, but you see I can be of no use.
Anne will send for me if anything is the matter."

<p/>Husbands and wives generally understand when opposition will be vain.
Mary knew, from Charles's manner of speaking, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was quite
determined on going, and that it would be of no use to teaze him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
said nothing, therefore, till he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was out of the room, but as soon as
there was only Anne to hear--

<p/>"So you and I are to be left to shift by ourselves, with this poor sick
child; and not a creature coming near us all the evening!  I knew how
it would be.  This is always my luck.  If there is anything
disagreeable going on men are always sure to get out of it, and Charles
is as bad as any of them.  Very unfeeling!  I must say it is very
unfeeling of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to be running away from his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) poor little boy.  Talks of
his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) being going on so well!  How does he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) know that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is going on well,
or that there may not be a sudden change half an hour hence?  I did not
think Charles would have been so unfeeling.  So here he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is to go away
and enjoy himself, and because I am the poor mother, I am not to be
allowed to stir; and yet, I am sure, I am more unfit than anybody else
to be about the child.  My being the mother is the very reason why my
feelings should not be tried.  I am not at all equal to it.  You saw
how hysterical I was yesterday."

<p/>"But that was only the effect of the suddenness of your alarm--of the
shock.  You will not be hysterical again.  I dare say we shall have
nothing to distress us.  I perfectly understand Mr Robinson's
directions, and have no fears; and indeed, Mary, I cannot wonder at
your husband.  Nursing does not belong to a man; it is not his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
province.  A sick child is always the mother's property:  her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) own
feelings generally make it so."

<p/>"I hope I am as fond of my child as any mother, but I do not know that
I am of any more use in the sick-room than Charles, for I cannot be
always scolding and teazing the poor child when it is ill; and you saw,
this morning, that if I told him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to keep quiet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was sure to begin
kicking about.  I have not nerves for the sort of thing."

<p/>"But, could you be comfortable yourself, to be spending the whole
evening away from the poor boy?"

<p/>"Yes; you see his (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) papa can, and why should not I?  Jemima is so
careful; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jemima</b></font>) could send us word every hour how he (<font color='blue'><b>boy</b></font>) was.  I really
think Charles might as well have told his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father we would all come.  I
am not more alarmed about little Charles now than he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) is.  I was
dreadfully alarmed yesterday, but the case is very different to-day."

<p/>"Well, if you do not think it too late to give notice for yourself,
suppose you were to go, as well as your husband.  Leave little Charles
to my care.  Mr and Mrs Musgrove cannot think it wrong while I remain
with him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr</b></font>)."

<p/>"Are you serious?<div class="bookquote">" cried Mary, her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) eyes brightening.  " (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>Dear me!  that's
a very good thought, very good, indeed.  To be sure, I may just as well
go as not, for I am of no use at home--am I?  and it only harasses me.
You, who have not a mother's feelings, are a great deal the properest
person.  You can make little Charles do anything; he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) always minds you
at a word.  It will be a great deal better than leaving him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) only with
Jemima.  Oh! I shall certainly go; I am sure I ought if I can, quite as
much as Charles, for they want me excessively to be acquainted with
Captain Wentworth, and I know you do not mind being left alone.  An
excellent thought of yours, indeed, Anne.  I will go and tell Charles,
and get ready directly.  You can send for us, you know, at a moment's
notice, if anything is the matter; but I dare say there will be nothing
to alarm you.  I should not go, you may be sure, if I did not feel
quite at ease about my dear child."

<p/>The next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was tapping at her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband's dressing-room door,
and as Anne followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) up stairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was in time for the whole
conversation, which began with Mary's saying, in a tone of great
exultation--

<p/>"I mean to go with you, Charles, for I am of no more use at home than
you are.  If I were to shut myself up for ever with the child, I should
not be able to persuade him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) to do anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) did not like.  Anne will
stay; Anne undertakes to stay at home and take care of him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).  It is
Anne's own proposal, and so I shall go with you, which will be a great
deal better, for I have not dined at the other house since Tuesday."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"This is very kind of Anne,"  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>was her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) husband's answer, "and I should be
very glad to have you go; but it seems rather hard that she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should be
left at home by herself, to nurse our sick child."

<p/>Anne was now at hand to take up her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) own cause, and the sincerity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
manner being soon sufficient to convince him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>), where conviction was at
least very agreeable, he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) had no farther scruples as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) being left
to dine alone, though he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) still wanted her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to join them in the evening,
when the child might be at rest for the night, and kindly urged her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) to
let him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) come and fetch her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), but she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was quite unpersuadable; and this
being the case, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had ere long the pleasure of seeing them set off
together in high spirits.  They were gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) hoped, to be happy,
however oddly constructed such happiness might seem; as for herself,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) was left with as many sensations of comfort, as were, perhaps, ever
likely to be hers.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) knew herself to be of the first utility to the
child; and what was it to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) if Frederick Wentworth were only half a
mile distant, making himself agreeable to others?

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) would have liked to know how he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt as to a meeting.  Perhaps
indifferent, if indifference could exist under such circumstances.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
must be either indifferent or unwilling.  Had he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) wished ever to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>)
again, he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) need not have waited till this time; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would have done what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not but believe that in his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) place she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) should have done long
ago, when events had been early giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) the independence which alone
had been wanting.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) brother and sister came back delighted with their new acquaintance,
and their visit in general.  There had been music, singing, talking,
laughing, all that was most agreeable; charming manners in Captain
Wentworth, no shyness or reserve; they seemed all to know each other
perfectly, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was coming the very next morning to shoot with
Charles.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was to come to breakfast, but not at the Cottage, though
that had been proposed at first; but then he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had been pressed to come
to the Great House instead, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Great</b></font>) seemed afraid of being in Mrs
Charles Musgrove's way, on account of the child, and therefore,
somehow, they hardly knew how, it ended in Charles's being to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>)
to breakfast at his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) father's.

<p/>Anne understood it.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) wished to avoid seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) had inquired
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) found, slightly, as might suit a former slight
acquaintance, seeming to acknowledge such as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had acknowledged,
actuated, perhaps, by the same view of escaping introduction when they
were to meet.

<p/>The morning hours of the Cottage were always later than those of the
other house, and on the morrow the difference was so great that Mary
and Anne were not more than beginning breakfast when Charles came in to
say that they were just setting off, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) was come for his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) dogs,
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>) sisters were following with Captain Wentworth; his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) sisters
meaning to visit Mary and the child, and Captain Wentworth proposing
also to wait on her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) for a few minutes if not inconvenient; and though
Charles had answered for the child's being in no such state as could
make it inconvenient, Captain Wentworth would not be satisfied without
his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) running on to give notice.

<p/>Mary, very much gratified by this attention, was delighted to receive
him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>), while a thousand feelings rushed on Anne, of which this was the
most consoling, that it would soon be over.  And it was soon over.  In
two minutes after Charles's preparation, the others appeared; they were
in the drawing-room.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) eye half met Captain Wentworth's, a bow, a
curtsey passed; she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) heard his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) voice; he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) talked to Mary, said all that
was right, said something to the Miss Musgroves, enough to mark an easy
footing; the room seemed full, full of persons and voices, but a few
minutes ended it.  Charles shewed himself at the window, all was ready,
their visitor had bowed and was gone, the Miss Musgroves were gone too,
suddenly resolving to walk to the end of the village with the
sportsmen:  the room was cleared, and Anne might finish her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) breakfast
as she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could.

<p/>"It is over! it is over!<div class="bookquote">" she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) repeated to herself again and again, in
nervous gratitude.  " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>The worst is over!"

<p/>Mary talked, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) could not attend.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) had seen him (<font color='blue'><b>Charles</b></font>).  They had
met.  They had been once more in the same room.

<p/>Soon, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) began to reason with herself, and try to be feeling
less.  Eight years, almost eight years had passed, since all had been
given up.  How absurd to be resuming the agitation which such an
interval had banished into distance and indistinctness!  What might not
eight years do?  Events of every description, changes, alienations,
removals--all, all must be comprised in it, and oblivion of the past--
how natural, how certain too!  It included nearly a third part of her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)
own life.

<p/>Alas! with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) reasoning, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) found, that to retentive feelings
eight years may be little more than nothing.

<p/>Now, how were his (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sentiments to be read?  Was this like wishing to
avoid her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>)?  And the next moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was hating herself for the folly
which asked the question.

<p/>On one other question which perhaps her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) utmost wisdom might not have
prevented, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was soon spared all suspense; for, after the Miss
Musgroves had returned and finished their visit at the Cottage she (<font color='blue'><b>Musgroves</b></font>) had
this spontaneous information from Mary:--

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Captain Wentworth is not very gallant by you, Anne, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was so
attentive to me.  Henrietta asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) what he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) thought of you, when they
went away, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) said, ' (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>You were so altered he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not have known
you again.'<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mary had no feelings to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) respect her (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) sister's in a common way,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>) was perfectly unsuspicious of being inflicting any peculiar
wound.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Altered beyond his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) knowledge."  Anne fully submitted, in silent, deep
mortification.  Doubtless it was so, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could take no revenge, for
he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) was not altered, or not for the worse.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had already acknowledged
it to herself, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) could not think differently, let him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) think of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) would.  No:  the years which had destroyed her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) youth and
bloom had only given him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) a more glowing, manly, open look, in no
respect lessening his (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) personal advantages.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had seen the same
Frederick Wentworth.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"So altered that he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) should not have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) again!"   (<font color='red'><b>her</b></font>)</div>These were words
which could not but dwell with her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  Yet she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) soon began to rejoice that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) had heard them.  They were of sobering tendency; they allayed
agitation; they composed, and consequently must make her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) happier.

<p/>Frederick Wentworth had used such words, or something like them, but
without an idea that they would be carried round to her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>).  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had
thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Anne</b></font>) wretchedly altered, and in the first moment of appeal, had
spoken as he (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) felt.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>) had not forgiven Anne Elliot.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had used him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>)
ill, deserted and disappointed him (<font color='blue'><b>Wentworth</b></font>); and worse, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had shewn a
feebleness of character in doing so, which his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) own decided, confident
temper could not endure.  She (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) had given him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) up to oblige others.  It
had been the effect of over-persuasion.  It had been weakness and
timidity.

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had been most warmly attached to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>), and had never seen a woman
since whom he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) thought her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) equal; but, except from some natural
sensation of curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had no desire of meeting her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>) again.  Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elliot</b></font>)
power with him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was gone for ever.

<p/>It was now his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) object to marry.  He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) was rich, and being turned on
shore, fully intended to settle as soon as he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) could be properly
tempted; actually looking round, ready to fall in love with all the
speed which a clear head and a quick taste could allow.  He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had a heart
for either of the Miss Musgroves, if they could catch it; a heart, in
short, for any pleasing young woman who came in his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) way, excepting Anne
Elliot.  This was his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) only secret exception, when he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) said to his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
sister, in answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) suppositions:--

<p/>"Yes, here I am, Sophia, quite ready to make a foolish match.  Anybody
between fifteen and thirty may have me for asking.  A little beauty,
and a few smiles, and a few compliments to the navy, and I am a lost
man.  Should not this be enough for a sailor, who has had no society
among women to make him (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) nice?"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) said it, she (<font color='blue'><b>Sophia</b></font>) knew, to be contradicted.  His (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) bright proud eye spoke
the conviction that he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) was nice; and Anne Elliot was not out of his (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>)
thoughts, when he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) more seriously described the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>) should wish to
meet with.  <div class="bookquote">"A strong mind, with sweetness of manner,"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>made the first
and the last of the description.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"That is the woman I want,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>sailor</b></font>).  "Something a little inferior I
shall of course put up with, but it must not be much.  If I am a fool,
I shall be a fool indeed, for I have thought on the subject more than
most men."
