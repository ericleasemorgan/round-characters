<p/>From a night of more sleep than she had expected, Marianne awoke the
next morning to the same consciousness of misery in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
closed her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) eyes.

<p/>Elinor encouraged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) as much as possible to talk of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) felt; and
before breakfast was ready, they had gone through the subject again and
again; and with the same steady conviction and affectionate counsel on
Elinor’s side, the same impetuous feelings and varying opinions on
Marianne’s, as before. Sometimes she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) could believe Willoughby to be as
unfortunate and as innocent as herself, and at others, lost every
consolation in the impossibility of acquitting him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>). At one moment she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
was absolutely indifferent to the observation of all the world, at
another she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) would seclude herself from it for ever, and at a third
could resist it with energy. In one thing, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was uniform,
when it came to the point, in avoiding, where it was possible, the
presence of Mrs. Jennings, and in a determined silence when obliged to
endure it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) heart was hardened against the belief of Mrs. Jennings’s
entering into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) sorrows with any compassion.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, no, no, it cannot be,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) cried; "she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) cannot feel. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) kindness
is not sympathy; her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) good-nature is not tenderness. All that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) wants
is gossip, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only likes me now because I supply it."

<p/>Elinor had not needed this to be assured of the injustice to which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
sister was often led in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) opinion of others, by the irritable
refinement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) own mind, and the too great importance placed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
on the delicacies of a strong sensibility, and the graces of a polished
manner. Like half the rest of the world, if more than half there be
that are clever and good, Marianne, with excellent abilities and an
excellent disposition, was neither reasonable nor candid. She (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) expected
from other people the same opinions and feelings as her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
judged of their motives by the immediate effect of their actions on
herself. Thus a circumstance occurred, while the sisters were together
in their own room after breakfast, which sunk the heart of Mrs.
Jennings still lower in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) estimation; because, through her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own
weakness, it chanced to prove a source of fresh pain to herself, though
Mrs. Jennings was governed in it by an impulse of the utmost goodwill.

<p/>With a letter in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) outstretched hand, and countenance gaily smiling,
from the persuasion of bringing comfort, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) entered their room,
saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now, my dear, I bring you something that I am sure will do you good."

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>Marianne heard enough. In one moment her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) imagination placed before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
a letter from Willoughby, full of tenderness and contrition,
explanatory of all that had passed, satisfactory, convincing; and
instantly followed by Willoughby himself, rushing eagerly into the room
to inforce, at her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) feet, by the eloquence of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) eyes, the assurances
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) letter. The work of one moment was destroyed by the next. The
hand writing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother, never till then unwelcome, was before her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>);
and, in the acuteness of the disappointment which followed such an
ecstasy of more than hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) felt as if, till that instant, she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had
never suffered.

<p/>The cruelty of Mrs. Jennings no language, within her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) reach in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>)
moments of happiest eloquence, could have expressed; and now she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could
reproach her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) only by the tears which streamed from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) eyes with
passionate violence—a reproach, however, so entirely lost on its
object, that after many expressions of pity, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) withdrew, still
referring her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) to the letter of comfort. But the letter, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) was
calm enough to read it, brought little comfort. Willoughby filled every
page. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) mother, still confident of their engagement, and relying as
warmly as ever on his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) constancy, had only been roused by Elinor’s
application, to intreat from Marianne greater openness towards them
both; and this, with such tenderness towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), such affection for
Willoughby, and such a conviction of their future happiness in each
other, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) wept with agony through the whole of it.

<p/>All her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) impatience to be at home again now returned; her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother was
dearer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) than ever; dearer through the very excess of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mistaken
confidence in Willoughby, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) was wildly urgent to be gone. Elinor,
unable herself to determine whether it were better for Marianne to be
in London or at Barton, offered no counsel of her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) own except of
patience till their mother’s wishes could be known; and at length she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>)
obtained her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister’s consent to wait for that knowledge.

<p/>Mrs. Jennings left them earlier than usual; for she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) could not be easy
till the Middletons and Palmers were able to grieve as much as herself;
and positively refusing Elinor’s offered attendance, went out alone for
the rest of the morning. Elinor, with a very heavy heart, aware of the
pain she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) was going to communicate, and perceiving, by Marianne’s
letter, how ill she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) had succeeded in laying any foundation for it, then
sat down to write her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) mother an account of what had passed, and entreat
her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) directions for the future; while Marianne, who came into the
drawing-room on Mrs. Jennings’s going away, remained fixed at the table
where Elinor wrote, watching the advancement of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) pen, grieving over
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) for the hardship of such a task, and grieving still more fondly
over its effect on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mother.

<p/>In this manner they had continued about a quarter of an hour, when
Marianne, whose nerves could not then bear any sudden noise, was
startled by a rap at the door.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Who can this be?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>cried Elinor. "So early too! I thought we _had_ been
safe.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Marianne moved to the window.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Colonel</b></font>)</div>It is Colonel Brandon!" said she (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), with vexation. "We are never safe
from _him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)_."

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) will not come in, as Mrs. Jennings is from home."

<p/>"I will not trust to _that_,<div class="bookquote">" retreating to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) own room. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>A man who
has nothing to do with his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) own time has no conscience in his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) intrusion
on that of others.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>The event proved her (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) conjecture right, though it was founded on
injustice and error; for Colonel Brandon _did_ come in; and Elinor, who
was convinced that solicitude for Marianne brought him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) thither, and who
saw _that_ solicitude in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) disturbed and melancholy look, and in his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
anxious though brief inquiry after her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>), could not forgive her (<font color='blue'><b>Marianne</b></font>) sister
for esteeming him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) so lightly.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I met Mrs. Jennings in Bond Street," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bond</b></font>), after the first
salutation, "and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jennings</b></font>) encouraged me to come on; and I was the more
easily encouraged, because I thought it probable that I might find you
alone, which I was very desirous of doing. My object—my wish—my sole
wish in desiring it—I hope, I believe it is—is to be a means of giving
comfort;—no, I must not say comfort—not present comfort—but conviction,
lasting conviction to your sister’s mind. My regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>), for
yourself, for your mother—will you allow me to prove it, by relating
some circumstances which nothing but a _very_ sincere regard—nothing
but an earnest desire of being useful—I think I am justified—though
where so many hours have been spent in convincing myself that I am
right, is there not some reason to fear I may be wrong?<div class="bookquote">" He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) stopped.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I understand you," said Elinor. "You have something to tell me of Mr.
Willoughby, that will open his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) character farther. Your telling it will
be the greatest act of friendship that can be shown Marianne. _My_
gratitude will be insured immediately by any information tending to
that end, and _hers_ must be gained by it in time. Pray, pray let me
hear it."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You shall; and, to be brief, when I quitted Barton last October,—but
this will give you no idea—I must go farther back. You will find me a
very awkward narrator, Miss Dashwood; I hardly know where to begin. A
short account of myself, I believe, will be necessary, and it _shall_
be a short one. On such a subject,"  (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>sighing heavily, "can I have little
temptation to be diffuse.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>narrator</b></font>) stopt a moment for recollection, and then, with another sigh, went
on.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Barton</b></font>)</div>You have probably entirely forgotten a conversation—(it is not to be
supposed that it could make any impression on you)—a conversation
between us one evening at Barton Park—it was the evening of a dance—in
which I alluded to a lady I had once known, as resembling, in some
measure, your sister Marianne."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elinor</b></font>)</div>answered Elinor, "I have _not_ forgotten it." He (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) looked
pleased by this remembrance, and added,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I am not deceived by the uncertainty, the partiality of tender
recollection, there is a very strong resemblance between them, as well
in mind as person. The same warmth of heart, the same eagerness of
fancy and spirits. This lady was one of my nearest relations, an orphan
from her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) infancy, and under the guardianship of my father. Our ages
were nearly the same, and from our earliest years we were playfellows
and friends. I cannot remember the time when I did not love Eliza; and
my affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>), as we grew up, was such, as perhaps, judging from
my present forlorn and cheerless gravity, you might think me incapable
of having ever felt. Hers, for me, was, I believe, fervent as the
attachment of your sister to Mr. Willoughby and it was, though from a
different cause, no less unfortunate. At seventeen she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was lost to me
for ever. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was married—married against her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) inclination to my
brother. Her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) fortune was large, and our family estate much encumbered.
And this, I fear, is all that can be said for the conduct of one, who
was at once her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) uncle and guardian. My brother did not deserve her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
did not even love her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). I had hoped that her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) regard for me would support
her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) under any difficulty, and for some time it did; but at last the
misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) situation, for she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) experienced great unkindness, overcame
all her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) resolution, and though she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had promised me that nothing—but how
blindly I relate! I have never told you how this was brought on. We
were within a few hours of eloping together for Scotland. The
treachery, or the folly, of my cousin’s maid betrayed us. I was
banished to the house of a relation far distant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) was allowed no
liberty, no society, no amusement, till my father’s point was gained. I
had depended on her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) fortitude too far, and the blow was a severe
one—but had her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) marriage been happy, so young as I then was, a few
months must have reconciled me to it, or at least I should not have now
to lament it. This however was not the case. My brother had no regard
for her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>); his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) pleasures were not what they ought to have been, and from
the first he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) treated her (<font color='blue'><b>maid</b></font>) unkindly. The consequence of this, upon a mind
so young, so lively, so inexperienced as Mrs. Brandon’s, was but too
natural. She (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) resigned herself at first to all the misery of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
situation; and happy had it been if she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) had not lived to overcome those
regrets which the remembrance of me occasioned. But can we wonder that,
with such a husband to provoke inconstancy, and without a friend to
advise or restrain her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) (for my father lived only a few months after
their marriage, and I was with my regiment in the East Indies) she (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>)
should fall? Had I remained in England, perhaps—but I meant to promote
the happiness of both by removing from her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) for years, and for that
purpose had procured my exchange. The shock which her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) marriage had
given me,"  (<font color='red'><b>He</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) continued, in a voice of great agitation, "was of
trifling weight—was nothing to what I felt when I heard, about two
years afterwards, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) divorce. It was _that_ which threw this
gloom,—even now the recollection of what I suffered—"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) could say no more, and rising hastily walked for a few minutes about
the room. Elinor, affected by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) relation, and still more by his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
distress, could not speak. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) concern, and coming to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), took
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and kissed it with grateful respect. A few
minutes more of silent exertion enabled him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to proceed with composure.

<p/>"It was nearly three years after this unhappy period before I returned
to England. My first care, when I _did_ arrive, was of course to seek
for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>); but the search was as fruitless as it was melancholy. I could
not trace her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) first seducer, and there was every reason to
fear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) had removed from him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only to sink deeper in a life of
sin. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) legal allowance was not adequate to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) fortune, nor
sufficient for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) comfortable maintenance, and I learnt from my
brother that the power of receiving it had been made over some months
before to another person. He (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagined, and calmly could he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) imagine it,
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) extravagance, and consequent distress, had obliged her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) to
dispose of it for some immediate relief. At last, however, and after I
had been six months in England, I _did_ find her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>). Regard for a former
servant of my own, who had since fallen into misfortune, carried me to
visit him (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) in a spunging-house, where he (<font color='blue'><b>servant</b></font>) was confined for debt; and
there, in the same house, under a similar confinement, was my
unfortunate sister. So altered—so faded—worn down by acute suffering of
every kind! hardly could I believe the melancholy and sickly figure
before me, to be the remains of the lovely, blooming, healthful girl,
on whom I had once doted. What I endured in so beholding her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)—but I have
no right to wound your feelings by attempting to describe it—I have
pained you too much already. That she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) was, to all appearance, in the
last stage of a consumption, was—yes, in such a situation it was my
greatest comfort. Life could do nothing for her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), beyond giving time for
a better preparation for death; and that was given. I saw her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) placed in
comfortable lodgings, and under proper attendants; I visited her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) every
day during the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) short life: I was with her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) last
moments.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Again he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) stopped to recover himself; and Elinor spoke her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) feelings in
an exclamation of tender concern, at the fate of his (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) unfortunate
friend.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>sister</b></font>)</div>Your sister, I hope, cannot be offended," said he (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), "by the resemblance
I have fancied between her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) and my poor disgraced relation. Their fates,
their fortunes, cannot be the same; and had the natural sweet
disposition of the one been guarded by a firmer mind, or a happier
marriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) might have been all that you will live to see the other
be. But to what does all this lead? I seem to have been distressing you
for nothing. Ah! Miss Dashwood—a subject such as this—untouched for
fourteen years—it is dangerous to handle it at all! I _will_ be more
collected—more concise. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) left to my care her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) only child, a little
girl, the offspring of her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) first guilty connection, who was then about
three years old. She (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) loved the child, and had always kept it with her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>).
It was a valued, a precious trust to me; and gladly would I have
discharged it in the strictest sense, by watching over her (<font color='blue'><b>Dashwood</b></font>) education
myself, had the nature of our situations allowed it; but I had no
family, no home; and my little Eliza was therefore placed at school. I
saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) there whenever I could, and after the death of my brother,
(which happened about five years ago, and which left to me the
possession of the family property,) she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) visited me at Delaford. I
called her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) a distant relation; but I am well aware that I have in
general been suspected of a much nearer connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>). It is now
three years ago (she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) had just reached her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fourteenth year,) that I
removed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) from school, to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) under the care of a very
respectable woman, residing in Dorsetshire, who had the charge of four
or five other girls of about the same time of life; and for two years I
had every reason to be pleased with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) situation. But last February,
almost a twelvemonth back, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) suddenly disappeared. I had allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>),
(imprudently, as it has since turned out,) at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) earnest desire, to go
to Bath with one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) young friends, who was attending her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) father
there for his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) health. I knew him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to be a very good sort of man, and I
thought well of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) daughter—better than she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) deserved, for, with a most
obstinate and ill-judged secrecy, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) would tell nothing, would give no
clue, though she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) certainly knew all. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) father, a well-meaning,
but not a quick-sighted man, could really, I believe, give no
information; for he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had been generally confined to the house, while the
girls were ranging over the town and making what acquaintance they
chose; and he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) tried to convince me, as thoroughly as he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) was convinced
himself, of his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) daughter’s being entirely unconcerned in the business.
In short, I could learn nothing but that she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was gone; all the rest,
for eight long months, was left to conjecture. What I thought, what I
feared, may be imagined; and what I suffered too."

<p/>"Good heavens!" cried Elinor, "could it be—could Willoughby!"—

<p/><div class="bookquote">"The first news that reached me of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) continued, "came in a
letter from herself, last October. It was forwarded to me from
Delaford, and I received it on the very morning of our intended party
to Whitwell; and this was the reason of my leaving Barton so suddenly,
which I am sure must at the time have appeared strange to every body,
and which I believe gave offence to some. Little did Mr. Willoughby
imagine, I suppose, when his (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) looks censured me for incivility in
breaking up the party, that I was called away to the relief of one whom
he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had made poor and miserable; but _had_ he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) known it, what would it
have availed? Would he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) have been less gay or less happy in the smiles
of your sister? No, he (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) had already done that, which no man who _can_
feel for another would do. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had left the girl whose youth and
innocence he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) had seduced, in a situation of the utmost distress, with
no creditable home, no help, no friends, ignorant of his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) address! He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
had left her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>), promising to return; he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) neither returned, nor wrote, nor
relieved her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>)."

<p/>"This is beyond every thing!<div class="bookquote">" exclaimed Elinor.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>character</b></font>)</div>His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character is now before you; expensive, dissipated, and worse than
both. Knowing all this, as I have now known it many weeks, guess what I
must have felt on seeing your sister as fond of him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) as ever, and on
being assured that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) was to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>): guess what I must have felt
for all your sakes. When I came to you last week and found you alone, I
came determined to know the truth; though irresolute what to do when it
_was_ known. My behaviour must have seemed strange to you then; but now
you will comprehend it. To suffer you all to be so deceived; to see
your sister—but what could I do? I had no hope of interfering with
success; and sometimes I thought your sister’s influence might yet
reclaim him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). But now, after such dishonorable usage, who can tell what
were his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) designs on her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Whatever they may have been, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) may
now, and hereafter doubtless _will_ turn with gratitude towards her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) own
condition, when she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) compares it with that of my poor Eliza, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)
considers the wretched and hopeless situation of this poor girl, and
pictures her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) to herself, with an affection for him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so strong, still as
strong as her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own, and with a mind tormented by self-reproach, which
must attend her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) through life. Surely this comparison must have its use
with her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) will feel her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) own sufferings to be nothing. They proceed
from no misconduct, and can bring no disgrace. On the contrary, every
friend must be made still more her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) friend by them. Concern for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)
unhappiness, and respect for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) fortitude under it, must strengthen
every attachment. Use your own discretion, however, in communicating to
her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) what I have told you. You must know best what will be its effect;
but had I not seriously, and from my heart believed it might be of
service, might lessen her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) regrets, I would not have suffered myself to
trouble you with this account of my family afflictions, with a recital
which may seem to have been intended to raise myself at the expense of
others.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor’s thanks followed this speech with grateful earnestness;
attended too with the assurance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) expecting material advantage to
Marianne, from the communication of what had passed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have been more pained," said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>), "by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) endeavors to acquit him (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>)
than by all the rest; for it irritates her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) mind more than the most
perfect conviction of his (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) unworthiness can do. Now, though at first she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
will suffer much, I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) will soon become easier. Have you," she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>)
continued, after a short silence, "ever seen Mr. Willoughby since you
left him (<font color='blue'><b>Willoughby</b></font>) at Barton?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) replied gravely, "once I have. One meeting was unavoidable."

<p/>Elinor, startled by his (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) manner, looked at him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) anxiously, saying,

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What? have you met him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) to—"

 (<font color='red'><b>him</b></font>)</div><p/>"I could meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Barton</b></font>) no other way. Eliza had confessed to me, though most
reluctantly, the name of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eliza</b></font>) lover; and when he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) returned to town, which
was within a fortnight after myself, we met by appointment, he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) to
defend, I to punish his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) conduct. We returned unwounded, and the
meeting, therefore, never got abroad.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elinor sighed over the fancied necessity of this; but to a man and a
soldier she (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) presumed not to censure it.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Such," said Colonel Brandon, after a pause, "has been the unhappy
resemblance between the fate of mother and daughter! and so imperfectly
have I discharged my trust!"

<p/>"Is she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) still in town?"

<p/>"No; as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) lying-in, for I found her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) near
her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) delivery, I removed her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) child into the country, and there
she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) remains."

<p/>Recollecting, soon afterwards, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) was probably dividing Elinor
from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) sister, he (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) put an end to his (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>) visit, receiving from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) again
the same grateful acknowledgments, and leaving her (<font color='blue'><b>Elinor</b></font>) full of compassion
and esteem for him (<font color='blue'><b>Brandon</b></font>).
