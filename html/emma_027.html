<p/>Emma did not repent her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must have delighted the Coles worthy people, who deserved to be made happy! And left a name behind her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that would not soon die away.

<p/>Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not quite easy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) doubted whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) submission to all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) told, was a compliment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) penetration, which made it difficult for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be quite certain that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ought to have held her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tongue.

<p/>The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had no doubt. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) own playing and singing. She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) childhood and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) was then interrupted by Harriet's coming in; and if Harriet's praise could have satisfied her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might soon have been comforted.

<p/>"Oh! if I could but play as well as you and Miss Fairfax!"

<p/>"Don't class us together, Harriet. My playing is no more like her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>)'s, than a lamp is like sunshine."

<p/>"Oh! dear I think you play the best of the two. I think you play quite as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) does. I am sure I had much rather hear you. Every body last night said how well you played."

<p/>"Those who knew any thing about it, must have felt the difference. The truth is, Harriet, that my playing is just good enough to be praised, but Jane Fairfax's is much beyond it."

<p/>"Well, I always shall think that you play quite as well as she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does, or that if there is any difference nobody would ever find it out. Mr. Cole said how much taste you had; and Mr. Frank Churchill talked a great deal about your taste, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) valued taste much more than execution."

<p/>"Ah! but Jane Fairfax has them both, Harriet."

<p/>"Are you sure? I saw she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had execution, but I did not know she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had any taste. Nobody talked about it. And I hate Italian singing. There is no understanding a word of it. Besides, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) does play so very well, you know, it is no more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is obliged to do, because she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) will have to teach. The Coxes were wondering last night whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) would get into any great family. How did you think the Coxes looked?"

<p/>"Just as they always do very vulgar."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"They told me something,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet rather hesitatingly; "but it is nothing of any consequence.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma was obliged to ask what they had told her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), though fearful of its producing Mr. Elton.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div>They told me that Mr. Martin dined with them last Saturday."

<p/>"Oh!"

<p/>"He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) came to their father upon some business, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) to stay to dinner."

<p/>"Oh!"

<p/>"They talked a great deal about him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>), especially Anne Cox. I do not know what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) asked me if I thought I should go and stay there again next summer."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) meant to be impertinently curious, just as such an Anne Cox should be."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) was very agreeable the day he (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) dined there. He (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>) sat by her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) at dinner. Miss Nash thinks either of the Coxes would be very glad to marry him (<font color='blue'><b>Martin</b></font>)."

<p/>"Very likely. I think they are, without exception, the most vulgar girls in Highbury."

<p/>Harriet had business at Ford's. Emma thought it most prudent to go with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Another accidental meeting with the Martins was possible, and in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present state, would be dangerous.

<p/>Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was still hanging over muslins and changing her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) mind, Emma went to the door for amusement. Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury; Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could presume to expect; and when her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) eyes fell only on the butcher with his (<font color='blue'><b>butcher</b></font>) tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury; to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye. Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"For my companion tells me,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), "that I absolutely promised Miss Bates last night, that I would come this morning. I was not aware of it myself. I did not know that I had fixed a day, but as he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) says I did, I am going now."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And while Mrs. Weston pays her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) visit, I may be allowed, I hope,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Frank Churchill/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Frank Churchill, "to join your party and wait for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) at Hartfield if you are going home.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Weston was disappointed.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I thought you meant to go with me. They would be very much pleased."

<p/>"Me! I should be quite in the way. But, perhaps I may be equally in the way here. Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) did not want me. My aunt always sends me off when she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) is shopping. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) says I fidget her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) to death; and Miss Woodhouse looks as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) could almost say the same. What am I to do?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am here on no business of my own,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma; "I am only waiting for my friend. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) will probably have soon done, and then we shall go home. But you had better go with Mrs. Weston and hear the instrument."

<p/>"Well if you advise it. But (with a smile) if Colonel Campbell should have employed a careless friend, and if it should prove to have an indifferent tone what shall I say? I shall be no support to Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) might do very well by herself. A disagreeable truth would be palatable through her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) lips, but I am the wretchedest being in the world at a civil falsehood."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do not believe any such thing,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>replied Emma. "I am persuaded that you can be as insincere as your neighbours, when it is necessary; but there is no reason to suppose the instrument is indifferent. Quite otherwise indeed, if I understood Miss Fairfax's opinion last night."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do come with me,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston, "if it be not very disagreeable to you. It need not detain us long. We will go to Hartfield afterwards. We will follow them to Hartfield. I really wish you to call with me. It will be felt so great an attention! and I always thought you meant it."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>) could say no more; and with the hope of Hartfield to reward him (<font color='blue'><b>you</b></font>), returned with Mrs. Weston to Mrs. Bates's door. Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter, trying, with all the force of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, to convince her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) that if she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) yellow pattern. At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Should I send it to Mrs. Goddard's, ma'am?"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ford/Ford</b></font>)</div>asked Mrs. Ford. "Yes no yes, to Mrs. Goddard's. Only my pattern gown is at Hartfield. No, you shall send it to Hartfield, if you please. But then, Mrs. Goddard will want to see it. And I could take the pattern gown home any day. But I shall want the ribbon directly so it had better go to Hartfield at least the ribbon. You could make it into two parcels, Mrs. Ford, could not you?"

<p/>"It is not worth while, Harriet, to give Mrs. Ford the trouble of two parcels."

<p/>"No more it is."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No trouble in the world, ma'am,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Ford/Ford</b></font>)</div>said the obliging Mrs. Ford.

<p/>"Oh! but indeed I would much rather have it only in one. Then, if you please, you shall send it all to Mrs. Goddard's I do not know No, I think, Miss Woodhouse, I may just as well have it sent to Hartfield, and take it home with me at night. What do you advise?"

<p/>"That you do not give another half-second to the subject. To Hartfield, if you please, Mrs. Ford."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Aye, that will be much best,"  (<font color='red'><b>Harriet</b></font>)</div>said Harriet, quite satisfied, "I should not at all like to have it sent to Mrs. Goddard's.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Voices approached the shop or rather one voice and two ladies: Mrs. Weston and Miss Bates met them at the door.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Miss Woodhouse</b></font>)</div>My dear Miss Woodhouse," said the latter, "I am just run across to entreat the favour of you to come and sit down with us a little while, and give us your opinion of our new instrument; you and Miss Smith. How do you do, Miss Smith? Very well I thank you. And I begged Mrs. Weston to come with me, that I might be sure of succeeding."

<p/>"I hope Mrs. Bates and Miss Fairfax are "

<p/>"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse? I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here. Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) and now we are such a nice party, she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) cannot refuse. <div class="bookquote">'Aye, pray do,'  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Frank Churchill/Frank Churchill</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Frank Churchill, 'Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.' But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me. <div class="bookquote">'Oh,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), 'wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;' For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles. The rivet came out, you know, this morning. So very obliging! For my mother had no use of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) spectacles could not put them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her (<font color='blue'><b>Wallis</b></font>) boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us. besides dear Jane at present and she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) really eats nothing makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) eats so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) gets hungry, and there is nothing she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) in the street. Not that I had any doubt before I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."

<p/>Emma would be <div class="bookquote">"very happy to wait on Mrs. Bates, &c.,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>and they did at last move out of the shop, with no farther delay from Miss Bates than,

<p/>"How do you do, Mrs. Ford? I beg your pardon. I did not see you before. I hear you have a charming collection of new ribbons from town. Jane came back delighted yesterday. Thank ye, the gloves do very well only a little too large about the wrist; but Jane is taking them in."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"What was I talking of?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), beginning again when they were all in the street.

<p/>Emma wondered on what, of all the medley, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would fix.

<p/>"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of. Oh! my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! <div class="bookquote">'Oh!'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), 'I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.' Which you know shewed him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) to be so very.... Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) before and much as I had expected, he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) very far exceeds any thing.... I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seems every thing the fondest parent could.... 'Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), 'I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.<div class="bookquote">' I never shall forget his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, ' (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh!' said he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) directly, 'there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very.... And I am sure, by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) trees I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was always famous in her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) enjoyed them, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. <div class="bookquote">'I am sure you must be,'  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), 'and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) would not for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) should be sending us more, so liberal as he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) was gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) almost quarrelled with me No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) wished I had made him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>) believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Larkins</b></font>). But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had; he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) had brought them all and now his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) was so pleased to think his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) could not bear that her (<font color='blue'><b>Hodges</b></font>) master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He (<font color='blue'><b>master</b></font>) told Patty this, but bid her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would be so very.... I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Bates had just done as Patty opened the door; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) visitors walked upstairs without having any regular narration to attend to, pursued only by the sounds of her (<font color='blue'><b>Patty</b></font>) desultory good-will.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Pray take care, Mrs. Weston, there is a step at the turning. Pray take care, Miss Woodhouse, ours is rather a dark staircase rather darker and narrower than one could wish. Miss Smith, pray take care. Miss Woodhouse, I am quite concerned, I am sure you hit your foot. Miss Smith, the step at the turning."
