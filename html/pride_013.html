<p/><div class="bookquote">"I hope, my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, as they were at
breakfast the next morning, "that you have ordered a good dinner
to-day, because I have reason to expect an addition to our family
party."

<p/>"Who do you mean, my dear? I know of nobody that is coming, I am
sure, unless Charlotte Lucas should happen to call in—and I hope
_my_ dinners are good enough for her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>). I do not believe she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) often
sees such at home."

<p/>"The person of whom I speak is a gentleman, and a stranger.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled. " (<font color='red'><b>A gentleman stranger</b></font>)</div>A gentleman and a stranger! It is
Mr. Bingley, I am sure! Well, I am sure I shall be extremely glad
to see Mr. Bingley. But—good Lord! how unlucky! There is not a
bit of fish to be got to-day. Lydia, my love, ring the bell—I
must speak to Hill this moment."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is _not_ Mr. Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>husband</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) husband; "it is a person whom
I never saw in the whole course of my life."

<p/>This roused a general astonishment; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had the pleasure of
being eagerly questioned by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wife and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) five daughters at
once.

<p/>After amusing himself some time with their curiosity, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) thus
explained:

<p/>"About a month ago I received this letter; and about a fortnight
ago I answered it, for I thought it a case of some delicacy, and
requiring early attention. It is from my cousin, Mr. Collins,
who, when I am dead, may turn you all out of this house as soon
as he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) pleases."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! my dear,"  (<font color='red'><b>wife</b></font>)</div>cried his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife, "I cannot bear to hear that
mentioned. Pray do not talk of that odious man. I do think it is
the hardest thing in the world, that your estate should be
entailed away from your own children; and I am sure, if I had
been you, I should have tried long ago to do something or other
about it."

<p/>Jane and Elizabeth tried to explain to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) the nature of an
entail. They had often attempted to do it before, but it was a
subject on which Mrs. Bennet was beyond the reach of reason, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an
estate away from a family of five daughters, in favour of a man
whom nobody cared anything about.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It certainly is a most iniquitous affair,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, "and
nothing can clear Mr. Collins from the guilt of inheriting
Longbourn. But if you will listen to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) letter, you may perhaps
be a little softened by his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) manner of expressing himself."

<p/>"No, that I am sure I shall not; and I think it is very
impertinent of him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) to write to you at all, and very hypocritical.
I hate such false friends. Why could he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) not keep on quarreling
with you, as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) father did before him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)?"

<p/>"Why, indeed; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) does seem to have had some filial scruples on
that head, as you will hear."

<p/>"Hunsford, near Westerham, Kent, 15_th October_.

<p/>"Dear Sir,—
"The disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late
honoured father always gave me much uneasiness, and since I have
had the misfortune to lose him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), I have frequently wished to heal
the breach; but for some time I was kept back by my own doubts,
fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) memory for me to
be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>)
to be at variance.—<div class="bookquote">‘There, Mrs. Bennet.’ (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>—My mind, however, is now
made up on the subject, for having received ordination at Easter,
I have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage
of the Right Honourable Lady Catherine de Bourgh, widow of Sir
Lewis de Bourgh, whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to
the valuable rectory of this parish, where it shall be my earnest
endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
ladyship, and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies
which are instituted by the Church of England. As a clergyman,
moreover, I feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing
of peace in all families within the reach of my influence; and on
these grounds I flatter myself that my present overtures are
highly commendable, and that the circumstance of my being next in
the entail of Longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your
side, and not lead you to reject the offered olive-branch. I
cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring
your amiable daughters, and beg leave to apologise for it, as
well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible
amends—but of this hereafter. If you should have no objection to
receive me into your house, I propose myself the satisfaction of
waiting on you and your family, Monday, November 18th, by four
o’clock, and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the
Saturday se’ennight following, which I can do without any
inconvenience, as Lady Catherine is far from objecting to my
occasional absence on a Sunday, provided that some other
clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the day.—I remain, dear
sir, with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters, your
well-wisher and friend,

<p/>"WILLIAM COLLINS"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"At four o’clock, therefore, we may expect this peace-making
gentleman,"  (<font color='red'><b>WILLIAM</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet, as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) folded up the letter. <div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man, upon my
word, and I doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance,
especially if Lady Catherine should be so indulgent as to let him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
come to us again."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"There is some sense in what he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) says about the girls, however,
and if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) is disposed to make them any amends, I shall not be the
person to discourage him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)."

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/><div class="bookquote">"Though it is difficult,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said Jane, "to guess in what way he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) can
mean to make us the atonement he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) thinks our due, the wish is
certainly to his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) credit."

<p/>Elizabeth was chiefly struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) extraordinary deference for
Lady Catherine, and his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) kind intention of christening, marrying,
and burying his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) parishioners whenever it were required.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) must be an oddity, I think,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). "I cannot make him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
out.—There is something very pompous in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) style.—And what can
he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) mean by apologising for being next in the entail?—We cannot
suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) would help it if he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) could.—Could he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) be a sensible man,
sir?"

<p/>"No, my dear, I think not. I have great hopes of finding him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)
quite the reverse. There is a mixture of servility and
self-importance in his (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) letter, which promises well. I am
impatient to see him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"In point of composition,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mary</b></font>)</div>said Mary, "the letter does not seem
defective. The idea of the olive-branch perhaps is not wholly
new, yet I think it is well expressed."

<p/>To Catherine and Lydia, neither the letter nor its writer were in
any degree interesting. It was next to impossible that their
cousin should come in a scarlet coat, and it was now some weeks
since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any
other colour. As for their mother, Mr. Collins’s letter had done
away much of her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) ill-will, and she (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) was preparing to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) with
a degree of composure which astonished her (<font color='blue'><b>mother</b></font>) husband and daughters.

<p/>Mr. Collins was punctual to his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) time, and was received with great
politeness by the whole family. Mr. Bennet indeed said little;
but the ladies were ready enough to talk, and Mr. Collins seemed
neither in need of encouragement, nor inclined to be silent
himself. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was a tall, heavy-looking young man of
five-and-twenty. His (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) air was grave and stately, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) manners
were very formal. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had not been long seated before he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
complimented Mrs. Bennet on having so fine a family of daughters;
said he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had heard much of their beauty, but that in this instance
fame had fallen short of the truth; and added, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) did not
doubt her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage.
This gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hearers;
but Mrs. Bennet, who quarreled with no compliments, answered most
readily.

<p/>"You are very kind, I am sure; and I wish with all my heart it
may prove so, for else they will be destitute enough. Things are
settled so oddly."

<p/>"You allude, perhaps, to the entail of this estate."

<p/>"Ah! sir, I do indeed. It is a grievous affair to my poor girls,
you must confess. Not that I mean to find fault with _you_, for
such things I know are all chance in this world. There is no
knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed."

<p/>"I am very sensible, madam, of the hardship to my fair cousins,
and could say much on the subject, but that I am cautious of
appearing forward and precipitate. But I can assure the young
ladies that I come prepared to admire them. At present I will not
say more; but, perhaps, when we are better acquainted—"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>cousins</b></font>) was interrupted by a summons to dinner; and the girls smiled
on each other. They were not the only objects of Mr. Collins’s
admiration. The hall, the dining-room, and all its furniture,
were examined and praised; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) commendation of everything
would have touched Mrs. Bennet’s heart, but for the mortifying
supposition of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) viewing it all as his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) own future property. The
dinner too in its turn was highly admired; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) begged to know
to which of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was
owing. But he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was set right there by Mrs. Bennet, who assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good
cook, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen. He (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>)
begged pardon for having displeased her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). In a softened tone she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
declared herself not at all offended; but he (<font color='blue'><b>cook</b></font>) continued to
apologise for about a quarter of an hour.
