<p/>The visions of romance were over. Catherine was completely awakened.
Henry’s address, short as it had been, had more thoroughly opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
eyes to the extravagance of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) late fancies than all their several
disappointments had done. Most grievously was she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) humbled. Most
bitterly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) cry. It was not only with herself that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was
sunk—but with Henry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) folly, which now seemed even criminal, was all
exposed to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>), and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) must despise her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) forever. The liberty which her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
imagination had dared to take with the character of his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) father—could he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>)
ever forgive it? The absurdity of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) curiosity and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) fears—could
they ever be forgotten? She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hated herself more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could express.
He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had—she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thought he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had, once or twice before this fatal morning,
shown something like affection for her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>). But now—in short, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) made
herself as miserable as possible for about half an hour, went down when
the clock struck five, with a broken heart, and could scarcely give an
intelligible answer to Eleanor’s inquiry if she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was well. The
formidable Henry soon followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) into the room, and the only
difference in his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) behaviour to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was that he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) paid her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) rather more
attention than usual. Catherine had never wanted comfort more, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was aware of it.

<p/>The evening wore away with no abatement of this soothing politeness;
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits were gradually raised to a modest tranquillity. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) did
not learn either to forget or defend the past; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) learned to hope
that it would never transpire farther, and that it might not cost her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
Henry’s entire regard. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thoughts being still chiefly fixed on what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had with such causeless terror felt and done, nothing could shortly
be clearer than that it had been all a voluntary, self-created
delusion, each trifling circumstance receiving importance from an
imagination resolved on alarm, and everything forced to bend to one
purpose by a mind which, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the abbey, had been craving
to be frightened. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) remembered with what feelings she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had prepared
for a knowledge of Northanger. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) saw that the infatuation had been
created, the mischief settled, long before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) quitting Bath, and it
seemed as if the whole might be traced to the influence of that sort of
reading which she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had there indulged.

<p/>Charming as were all Mrs. Radcliffe’s works, and charming even as were
the works of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Radcliffe</b></font>) imitators, it was not in them perhaps that human
nature, at least in the Midland counties of England, was to be looked
for. Of the Alps and Pyrenees, with their pine forests and their vices,
they might give a faithful delineation; and Italy, Switzerland, and the
south of France might be as fruitful in horrors as they were there
represented. Catherine dared not doubt beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) own country, and even
of that, if hard pressed, would have yielded the northern and western
extremities. But in the central part of England there was surely some
security for the existence even of a wife not beloved, in the laws of
the land, and the manners of the age. Murder was not tolerated,
servants were not slaves, and neither poison nor sleeping potions to be
procured, like rhubarb, from every druggist. Among the Alps and
Pyrenees, perhaps, there were no mixed characters. There, such as were
not as spotless as an angel might have the dispositions of a fiend. But
in England it was not so; among the English, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) believed, in their
hearts and habits, there was a general though unequal mixture of good
and bad. Upon this conviction, she (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) would not be surprised if even in
Henry and Eleanor Tilney, some slight imperfection might hereafter
appear; and upon this conviction she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) need not fear to acknowledge some
actual specks in the character of their father, who, though cleared
from the grossly injurious suspicions which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) must ever blush to have
entertained, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did believe, upon serious consideration, to be not
perfectly amiable.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) mind made up on these several points, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) resolution formed, of
always judging and acting in future with the greatest good sense, she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)
had nothing to do but to forgive herself and be happier than ever; and
the lenient hand of time did much for her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) by insensible gradations in
the course of another day. Henry’s astonishing generosity and nobleness
of conduct, in never alluding in the slightest way to what had passed,
was of the greatest assistance to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>); and sooner than she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) could have
supposed it possible in the beginning of her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) distress, her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) spirits
became absolutely comfortable, and capable, as heretofore, of continual
improvement by anything he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) said. There were still some subjects,
indeed, under which she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) believed they must always tremble—the mention
of a chest or a cabinet, for instance—and she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) did not love the sight of
japan in any shape: but even _she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)_ could allow that an occasional
memento of past folly, however painful, might not be without use.

<p/>The anxieties of common life began soon to succeed to the alarms of
romance. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) desire of hearing from Isabella grew every day greater.
She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) was quite impatient to know how the Bath world went on, and how the
rooms were attended; and especially was she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) anxious to be assured of
Isabella’s having matched some fine netting-cotton, on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had
left her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) intent; and of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) continuing on the best terms with James.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) only dependence for information of any kind was on Isabella. James
had protested against writing to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) till his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) return to Oxford; and
Mrs. Allen had given her (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) no hopes of a letter till she (<font color='blue'><b>Allen</b></font>) had got back to
Fullerton. But Isabella had promised and promised again; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)
promised a thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was so scrupulous in performing it! This made it
so particularly strange!

<p/>For nine successive mornings, Catherine wondered over the repetition of
a disappointment, which each morning became more severe: but, on the
tenth, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) entered the breakfast-room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) first object was a
letter, held out by Henry’s willing hand. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) thanked him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) as heartily
as if he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had written it himself. <div class="bookquote">"’Tis only from James, however,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>as
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked at the direction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) opened it; it was from Oxford; and to
this purpose:

<p/>"Dear Catherine,
"Though, God knows, with little inclination for writing, I think it
my duty to tell you that everything is at an end between Miss
Thorpe and me. I left her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) and Bath yesterday, never to see either
again. I shall not enter into particulars—they would only pain you
more. You will soon hear enough from another quarter to know where
lies the blame; and I hope will acquit your brother of everything
but the folly of too easily thinking his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) affection returned. Thank
God! I am undeceived in time! But it is a heavy blow! After my
father’s consent had been so kindly given—but no more of this. She (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
has made me miserable forever! Let me soon hear from you, dear
Catherine; you are my only friend; _your_ love I do build upon. I
wish your visit at Northanger may be over before Captain Tilney
makes his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) engagement known, or you will be uncomfortably
circumstanced. Poor Thorpe is in town: I dread the sight of him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>);
his (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) honest heart would feel so much. I have written to him (<font color='blue'><b>Captain</b></font>) and my
father. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) duplicity hurts me more than all; till the very last,
if I reasoned with her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) declared herself as much attached to me
as ever, and laughed at my fears. I am ashamed to think how long I
bore with it; but if ever man had reason to believe himself loved,
I was that man. I cannot understand even now what she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) would be at,
for there could be no need of my being played off to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>)
secure of Tilney. We parted at last by mutual consent—happy for me
had we never met! I can never expect to know such another woman!
Dearest Catherine, beware how you give your heart.


<p/>"Believe me," &c.


<p/>Catherine had not read three lines before her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sudden change of
countenance, and short exclamations of sorrowing wonder, declared her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
to be receiving unpleasant news; and Henry, earnestly watching her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
through the whole letter, saw plainly that it ended no better than it
began. He (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) was prevented, however, from even looking his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) surprise by his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>)
father’s entrance. They went to breakfast directly; but Catherine could
hardly eat anything. Tears filled her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) eyes, and even ran down her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
cheeks as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) sat. The letter was one moment in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hand, then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
lap, and then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) pocket; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) looked as if she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) knew not what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
did. The general, between his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) cocoa and his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) newspaper, had luckily no
leisure for noticing her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>); but to the other two her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) distress was equally
visible. As soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) dared leave the table she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) hurried away to her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
own room; but the housemaids were busy in it, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) was obliged to
come down again. She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) turned into the drawing-room for privacy, but
Henry and Eleanor had likewise retreated thither, and were at that
moment deep in consultation about her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) drew back, trying to beg
their pardon, but was, with gentle violence, forced to return; and the
others withdrew, after Eleanor had affectionately expressed a wish of
being of use or comfort to her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>).

<p/>After half an hour’s free indulgence of grief and reflection, Catherine
felt equal to encountering her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) friends; but whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) should make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
distress known to them was another consideration. Perhaps, if
particularly questioned, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) might just give an idea—just distantly
hint at it—but not more. To expose a friend, such a friend as Isabella
had been to her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)—and then their own brother so closely concerned in it!
She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) must waive the subject altogether. Henry and Eleanor
were by themselves in the breakfast-room; and each, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) entered it,
looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) anxiously. Catherine took her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) place at the table, and,
after a short silence, Eleanor said, "No bad news from Fullerton, I
hope? Mr. and Mrs. Morland—your brothers and sisters—I hope they are
none of them ill?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No, I thank you"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>(sighing as she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) spoke); "they are all very well. My
letter was from my brother at Oxford."

<p/>Nothing further was said for a few minutes; and then speaking through
her (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) tears, she (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) added, "I do not think I shall ever wish for a letter
again!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am sorry,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>said Henry, closing the book he (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) had just opened; "if I
had suspected the letter of containing anything unwelcome, I should
have given it with very different feelings."

<p/>"It contained something worse than anybody could suppose! Poor James is
so unhappy! You will soon know why."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"To have so kind-hearted, so affectionate a sister,"  (<font color='red'><b>Henry</b></font>)</div>replied Henry
warmly, "must be a comfort to him (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) under any distress."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I have one favour to beg,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, shortly afterwards, in an
agitated manner, "that, if your brother should be coming here, you will
give me notice of it, that I may go away."

<p/>"Our brother! Frederick!"

<p/>"Yes; I am sure I should be very sorry to leave you so soon, but
something has happened that would make it very dreadful for me to be in
the same house with Captain Tilney.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Eleanor’s work was suspended while she (<font color='blue'><b>Eleanor</b></font>) gazed with increasing
astonishment; but Henry began to suspect the truth, and something, in
which Miss Thorpe’s name was included, passed his (<font color='blue'><b>Henry</b></font>) lips.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>How quick you are!" cried Catherine: "you have guessed it, I declare!
And yet, when we talked about it in Bath, you little thought of its
ending so. Isabella—no wonder _now_ I have not heard from her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>)—Isabella
has deserted my brother, and is to marry yours! Could you have believed
there had been such inconstancy and fickleness, and everything that is
bad in the world?"

<p/>"I hope, so far as concerns my brother, you are misinformed. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
has not had any material share in bringing on Mr. Morland’s
disappointment. His (<font color='blue'><b>Morland</b></font>) marrying Miss Thorpe is not probable. I think you
must be deceived so far. I am very sorry for Mr. Morland—sorry that
anyone you love should be unhappy; but my surprise would be greater at
Frederick’s marrying her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) than at any other part of the story."

<p/>"It is very true, however; you shall read James’s letter yourself.
Stay—There is one part—<div class="bookquote">" recollecting with a blush the last line.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>brother</b></font>)</div>Will you take the trouble of reading to us the passages which concern
my brother?"

<p/>"No, read it yourself,<div class="bookquote">" cried Catherine, whose second thoughts were
clearer. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I do not know what I was thinking of" (blushing again that
she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had blushed before); "James only means to give me good advice."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) gladly received the letter, and, having read it through, with close
attention, returned it saying, "Well, if it is to be so, I can only say
that I am sorry for it. Frederick will not be the first man who has
chosen a wife with less sense than his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) family expected. I do not envy
his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) situation, either as a lover or a son.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Tilney, at Catherine’s invitation, now read the letter likewise,
and, having expressed also her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) concern and surprise, began to inquire
into Miss Thorpe’s connections and fortune.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>mother</b></font>)</div>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) mother is a very good sort of woman," was Catherine’s answer.

<p/>"What was her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father?"

<p/>"A lawyer, I believe. They live at Putney."

<p/>"Are they a wealthy family?"

<p/>"No, not very. I do not believe Isabella has any fortune at all: but
that will not signify in your family. Your father is so very liberal!
He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) told me the other day that he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) only valued money as it allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) to
promote the happiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) children.<div class="bookquote">" The brother and sister looked
at each other. " (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)</div>But," said Eleanor, after a short pause, "would it be
to promote his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) happiness, to enable him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) to marry such a girl? She (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) must
be an unprincipled one, or she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) could not have used your brother so. And
how strange an infatuation on Frederick’s side! A girl who, before his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
eyes, is violating an engagement voluntarily entered into with another
man! Is not it inconceivable, Henry? Frederick too, who always wore his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>)
heart so proudly! Who found no woman good enough to be loved!"

<p/>"That is the most unpromising circumstance, the strongest presumption
against him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>). When I think of his (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) past declarations, I give him (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) up.
Moreover, I have too good an opinion of Miss Thorpe’s prudence to
suppose that she (<font color='blue'><b>Thorpe</b></font>) would part with one gentleman before the other was
secured. It is all over with Frederick indeed! He (<font color='blue'><b>Frederick</b></font>) is a deceased
man—defunct in understanding. Prepare for your sister-in-law, Eleanor,
and such a sister-in-law as you must delight in! Open, candid, artless,
guileless, with affections strong but simple, forming no pretensions,
and knowing no disguise."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Such a sister-in-law, Henry, I should delight in,"  (<font color='red'><b>Eleanor</b></font>)</div>said Eleanor with a
smile.

<p/>"But perhaps," observed Catherine, "though she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has behaved so ill by
our family, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may behave better by yours. Now she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) has really got the
man she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) likes, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) may be constant."

<p/>"Indeed I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will," replied Henry; "I am afraid she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) will be
very constant, unless a baronet should come in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way; that is
Frederick’s only chance. I will get the Bath paper, and look over the
arrivals."

<p/>"You think it is all for ambition, then? And, upon my word, there are
some things that seem very like it. I cannot forget that, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
first knew what my father would do for them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) seemed quite
disappointed that it was not more. I never was so deceived in anyone’s
character in my life before."

<p/>"Among all the great variety that you have known and studied."

<p/>"My own disappointment and loss in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) is very great; but, as for poor
James, I suppose he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) will hardly ever recover it."

<p/>"Your brother is certainly very much to be pitied at present; but we
must not, in our concern for his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) sufferings, undervalue yours. You
feel, I suppose, that in losing Isabella, you lose half yourself: you
feel a void in your heart which nothing else can occupy. Society is
becoming irksome; and as for the amusements in which you were wont to
share at Bath, the very idea of them without her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) is abhorrent. You
would not, for instance, now go to a ball for the world. You feel that
you have no longer any friend to whom you can speak with unreserve, on
whose regard you can place dependence, or whose counsel, in any
difficulty, you could rely on. You feel all this?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Catherine</b></font>)</div>said Catherine, after a few moments’ reflection, "I do not—ought
I? To say the truth, though I am hurt and grieved, that I cannot still
love her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), that I am never to hear from her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>), perhaps never to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
again, I do not feel so very, very much afflicted as one would have
thought."

<p/>"You feel, as you always do, what is most to the credit of human
nature. Such feelings ought to be investigated, that they may know
themselves."

<p/>Catherine, by some chance or other, found her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) spirits so very much
relieved by this conversation that she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) being led
on, though so unaccountably, to mention the circumstance which had
produced it.
