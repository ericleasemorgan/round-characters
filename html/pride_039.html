<p/>It was the second week in May, in which the three young ladies
set out together from Gracechurch Street for the town of ——, in
Hertfordshire; and, as they drew near the appointed inn where Mr.
Bennet’s carriage was to meet them, they quickly perceived, in
token of the coachman’s punctuality, both Kitty and Lydia looking
out of a dining-room up stairs. These two girls had been above an
hour in the place, happily employed in visiting an opposite
milliner, watching the sentinel on guard, and dressing a salad
and cucumber.

<p/>After welcoming their sisters, they triumphantly displayed a
table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually
affords, exclaiming, "Is not this nice? Is not this an agreeable
surprise?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And we mean to treat you all,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>added Lydia, "but you must lend
us the money, for we have just spent ours at the shop out there."
Then, showing her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) purchases—"Look here, I have bought this
bonnet. I do not think it is very pretty; but I thought I might
as well buy it as not. I shall pull it to pieces as soon as I get
home, and see if I can make it up any better.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>And when her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) sisters abused it as ugly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) added, with perfect
unconcern, " (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Oh! but there were two or three much uglier in the
shop; and when I have bought some prettier-coloured satin to trim
it with fresh, I think it will be very tolerable. Besides, it
will not much signify what one wears this summer, after the
——shire have left Meryton, and they are going in a fortnight."

<p/>"Are they indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth, with the greatest
satisfaction.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>They are going to be encamped near Brighton; and I do so want
papa to take us all there for the summer! It would be such a
delicious scheme; and I dare say would hardly cost anything at
all. Mamma would like to go too of all things! Only think what a
miserable summer else we shall have!"

<p/>"Yes," thought Elizabeth, "_that_ would be a delightful scheme
indeed, and completely do for us at once. Good Heaven! Brighton,
and a whole campful of soldiers, to us, who have been overset
already by one poor regiment of militia, and the monthly balls of
Meryton!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now I have got some news for you,"  (<font color='red'><b>Lydia</b></font>)</div>said Lydia, as they sat down
at table. "What do you think? It is excellent news—capital
news—and about a certain person we all like!"

<p/>Jane and Elizabeth looked at each other, and the waiter was told
he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) need not stay. Lydia laughed, and said:

<p/>"Aye, that is just like your formality and discretion. You
thought the waiter must not hear, as if he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) cared! I dare say he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>)
often hears worse things said than I am going to say. But he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) is
an ugly fellow! I am glad he (<font color='blue'><b>waiter</b></font>) is gone. I never saw such a long
chin in my life. Well, but now for my news; it is about dear
Wickham; too good for the waiter, is it not? There is no danger
of Wickham’s marrying Mary King. There’s for you! She (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) is gone
down to her (<font color='blue'><b>King</b></font>) uncle at Liverpool: gone to stay. Wickham is safe."

<p/>"And Mary King is safe!" added Elizabeth; "safe from a connection
imprudent as to fortune."

<p/>"She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) is a great fool for going away, if she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) liked him (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"But I hope there is no strong attachment on either side,"  (<font color='red'><b>Jane</b></font>)</div>said
Jane.

<p/>"I am sure there is not on _his (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>)_. I will answer for it, he (<font color='blue'><b>fool</b></font>) never
cared three straws about her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)—who _could_ about such a nasty
little freckled thing?"

<p/>Elizabeth was shocked to think that, however incapable of such
coarseness of _expression_ herself, the coarseness of the
_sentiment_ was little other than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own breast had harboured
and fancied liberal!

<p/>As soon as all had ate, and the elder ones paid, the carriage was
ordered; and after some contrivance, the whole party, with all
their boxes, work-bags, and parcels, and the unwelcome addition
of Kitty’s and Lydia’s purchases, were seated in it.

<p/>"How nicely we are all crammed in," cried Lydia. "I am glad I
bought my bonnet, if it is only for the fun of having another
bandbox! Well, now let us be quite comfortable and snug, and talk
and laugh all the way home. And in the first place, let us hear
what has happened to you all since you went away. Have you seen
any pleasant men? Have you had any flirting? I was in great hopes
that one of you would have got a husband before you came back.
Jane will be quite an old maid soon, I declare. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) is almost
three-and-twenty! Lord, how ashamed I should be of not being
married before three-and-twenty! My aunt Phillips wants you so to
get husbands, you can’t think. She (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) says Lizzy had better have
taken Mr. Collins; but _I_ do not think there would have been any
fun in it. Lord! how I should like to be married before any of
you; and then I would _chaperon_ you about to all the balls. Dear
me! we had such a good piece of fun the other day at Colonel
Forster’s. Kitty and me were to spend the day there, and Mrs.
Forster promised to have a little dance in the evening; (by the
bye, Mrs. Forster and me are _such_ friends!) and so she (<font color='blue'><b>Forster</b></font>) asked
the two Harringtons to come, but Harriet was ill, and so Pen was
forced to come by herself; and then, what do you think we did? We
dressed up Chamberlayne in woman’s clothes on purpose to pass for
a lady, only think what fun! Not a soul knew of it, but Colonel
and Mrs. Forster, and Kitty and me, except my aunt, for we were
forced to borrow one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) gowns; and you cannot imagine how
well he (<font color='blue'><b>Colonel</b></font>) looked! When Denny, and Wickham, and Pratt, and two or
three more of the men came in, they did not know him (<font color='blue'><b>Denny</b></font>) in the
least. Lord! how I laughed! and so did Mrs. Forster. I thought I
should have died. And _that_ made the men suspect something, and
then they soon found out what was the matter."

<p/>With such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes, did
Lydia, assisted by Kitty’s hints and additions, endeavour to
amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) companions all the way to Longbourn. Elizabeth listened
as little as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could, but there was no escaping the frequent
mention of Wickham’s name.

<p/>Their reception at home was most kind. Mrs. Bennet rejoiced to
see Jane in undiminished beauty; and more than once during dinner
did Mr. Bennet say voluntarily to Elizabeth:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am glad you are come back, Lizzy."

 (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div><p/>Their party in the dining-room was large, for almost all the
Lucases came to meet Maria and hear the news; and various were
the subjects that occupied them: Lady Lucas was enquiring of
Maria, after the welfare and poultry of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) eldest daughter; Mrs.
Bennet was doubly engaged, on one hand collecting an account of
the present fashions from Jane, who sat some way below her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), and,
on the other, retailing them all to the younger Lucases; and
Lydia, in a voice rather louder than any other person’s, was
enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who
would hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Oh! Mary,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Mary</b></font>), "I wish you had gone with us, for we had
such fun! As we went along, Kitty and I drew up the blinds, and
pretended there was nobody in the coach; and I should have gone
so all the way, if Kitty had not been sick; and when we got to
the George, I do think we behaved very handsomely, for we treated
the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world, and
if you would have gone, we would have treated you too. And then
when we came away it was such fun! I thought we never should have
got into the coach. I was ready to die of laughter. And then we
were so merry all the way home! we talked and laughed so loud,
that anybody might have heard us ten miles off!"

<p/>To this Mary very gravely replied, "Far be it from me, my dear
sister, to depreciate such pleasures! They would doubtless be
congenial with the generality of female minds. But I confess they
would have no charms for _me_—I should infinitely prefer a book."

<p/>But of this answer Lydia heard not a word. She (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) seldom listened to
anybody for more than half a minute, and never attended to Mary
at all.

<p/>In the afternoon Lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to
walk to Meryton, and to see how everybody went on; but Elizabeth
steadily opposed the scheme. It should not be said that the Miss
Bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in
pursuit of the officers. There was another reason too for her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>)
opposition. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) dreaded seeing Mr. Wickham again, and was
resolved to avoid it as long as possible. The comfort to _her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>)_ of
the regiment’s approaching removal was indeed beyond expression.
In a fortnight they were to go—and once gone, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) hoped there
could be nothing more to plague her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) account.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) had not been many hours at home before she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennets</b></font>) found that the
Brighton scheme, of which Lydia had given them a hint at the inn,
was under frequent discussion between her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) parents. Elizabeth saw
directly that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father had not the smallest intention of
yielding; but his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) answers were at the same time so vague and
equivocal, that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, though often disheartened, had never
yet despaired of succeeding at last.
