<p/>Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were not detained long at Hartfield. The weather soon improved enough for those to move who must move; and Mr. Woodhouse having, as usual, tried to persuade his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) daughter to stay behind with all her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) children, was obliged to see the whole party set off, and return to his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) lamentations over the destiny of poor Isabella; which poor Isabella, passing her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) life with those she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doated on, full of their merits, blind to their faults, and always innocently busy, might have been a model of right feminine happiness.

<p/>The evening of the very day on which they went brought a note from Mr. Elton to Mr. Woodhouse, a long, civil, ceremonious note, to say, with Mr. Elton's best compliments, "that he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was proposing to leave Highbury the following morning in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) way to Bath; where, in compliance with the pressing entreaties of some friends, he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) had engaged to spend a few weeks, and very much regretted the impossibility he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) was under, from various circumstances of weather and business, of taking a personal leave of Mr. Woodhouse, of whose friendly civilities he (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) should ever retain a grateful sense and had Mr. Woodhouse any commands, should be happy to attend to them."

<p/>Emma was most agreeably surprized. Mr. Elton's absence just at this time was the very thing to be desired. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) for contriving it, though not able to give him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) much credit for the manner in which it was announced. Resentment could not have been more plainly spoken than in a civility to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father, from which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so pointedly excluded. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not even a share in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) opening compliments. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) name was not mentioned; and there was so striking a change in all this, and such an ill-judged solemnity of leave-taking in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) graceful acknowledgments, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, at first, could not escape her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father's suspicion.

<p/>It did, however. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father was quite taken up with the surprize of so sudden a journey, and his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) fears that Mr. Elton might never get safely to the end of it, and saw nothing extraordinary in his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) language. It was a very useful note, for it supplied them with fresh matter for thought and conversation during the rest of their lonely evening. Mr. Woodhouse talked over his (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) alarms, and Emma was in spirits to persuade them away with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) usual promptitude.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) now resolved to keep Harriet no longer in the dark. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had reason to believe her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) nearly recovered from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) cold, and it was desirable that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should have as much time as possible for getting the better of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) other complaint before the gentleman's return. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) went to Mrs. Goddard's accordingly the very next day, to undergo the necessary penance of communication; and a severe one it was. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had to destroy all the hopes which she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been so industriously feeding to appear in the ungracious character of the one preferred and acknowledge herself grossly mistaken and mis-judging in all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ideas on one subject, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) observations, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) convictions, all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) prophecies for the last six weeks.

<p/>The confession completely renewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) first shame and the sight of Harriet's tears made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) think that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) should never be in charity with herself again.

<p/>Harriet bore the intelligence very well blaming nobody and in every thing testifying such an ingenuousness of disposition and lowly opinion of herself, as must appear with particular advantage at that moment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) friend.

<p/>Emma was in the humour to value simplicity and modesty to the utmost; and all that was amiable, all that ought to be attaching, seemed on Harriet's side, not her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own. Harriet did not consider herself as having any thing to complain of. The affection of such a man as Mr. Elton would have been too great a distinction. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) never could have deserved him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) and nobody but so partial and kind a friend as Miss Woodhouse would have thought it possible.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) tears fell abundantly but her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) grief was so truly artless, that no dignity could have made it more respectable in Emma's eyes and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) listened to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) and tried to console her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) heart and understanding really for the time convinced that Harriet was the superior creature of the two and that to resemble her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would be more for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own welfare and happiness than all that genius or intelligence could do.

<p/>It was rather too late in the day to set about being simple-minded and ignorant; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) left her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) with every previous resolution confirmed of being humble and discreet, and repressing imagination all the rest of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) life. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) second duty now, inferior only to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father's claims, was to promote Harriet's comfort, and endeavour to prove her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) own affection in some better method than by match-making. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) got her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) to Hartfield, and shewed her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) the most unvarying kindness, striving to occupy and amuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), and by books and conversation, to drive Mr. Elton from her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts.

<p/>Time, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) knew, must be allowed for this being thoroughly done; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could suppose herself but an indifferent judge of such matters in general, and very inadequate to sympathise in an attachment to Mr. Elton in particular; but it seemed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) reasonable that at Harriet's age, and with the entire extinction of all hope, such a progress might be made towards a state of composure by the time of Mr. Elton's return, as to allow them all to meet again in the common routine of acquaintance, without any danger of betraying sentiments or increasing them.

<p/>Harriet did think him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) all perfection, and maintained the non-existence of any body equal to him (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintance</b></font>) in person or goodness and did, in truth, prove herself more resolutely in love than Emma had foreseen; but yet it appeared to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) so natural, so inevitable to strive against an inclination of that sort unrequited, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not comprehend its continuing very long in equal force.

<p/>If Mr. Elton, on his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) return, made his (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) own indifference as evident and indubitable as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) would anxiously do, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not imagine Harriet's persisting to place her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) happiness in the sight or the recollection of him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>).

<p/>Their being fixed, so absolutely fixed, in the same place, was bad for each, for all three. Not one of them had the power of removal, or of effecting any material change of society. They must encounter each other, and make the best of it.

<p/>Harriet was farther unfortunate in the tone of her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) companions at Mrs. Goddard's; Mr. Elton being the adoration of all the teachers and great girls in the school; and it must be at Hartfield only that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could have any chance of hearing him (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) spoken of with cooling moderation or repellent truth. Where the wound had been given, there must the cure be found if anywhere; and Emma felt that, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) saw her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the way of cure, there could be no true peace for herself.
