<p/>The discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw
Elizabeth into, could not be easily overcome; nor could she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), for
many hours, learn to think of it less than incessantly. Lady
Catherine, it appeared, had actually taken the trouble of this
journey from Rosings, for the sole purpose of breaking off her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
supposed engagement with Mr. Darcy. It was a rational scheme, to
be sure! but from what the report of their engagement could
originate, Elizabeth was at a loss to imagine; till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
recollected that _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ being the intimate friend of Bingley, and
_her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ being the sister of Jane, was enough, at a time when the
expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another, to
supply the idea. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had not herself forgotten to feel that the
marriage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister must bring them more frequently together.
And her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) neighbours at Lucas Lodge, therefore (for through their
communication with the Collinses, the report, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) concluded, had
reached Lady Catherine), had only set _that_ down as almost
certain and immediate, which _she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)_ had looked forward to as
possible at some future time.

<p/>In revolving Lady Catherine’s expressions, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) could not
help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) persisting in this interference. From what she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) had said of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) resolution to prevent their marriage, it occurred to
Elizabeth that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must meditate an application to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) nephew;
and how he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) might take a similar representation of the evils
attached to a connection with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dared not pronounce. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
knew not the exact degree of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) affection for his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt, or his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
dependence on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) judgment, but it was natural to suppose that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
thought much higher of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ladyship than _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_ could do; and it
was certain that, in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with
_one_, whose immediate connections were so unequal to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) own,
his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) aunt would address him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) on his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) weakest side. With his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) notions
of dignity, he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would probably feel that the arguments, which to
Elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous, contained much good
sense and solid reasoning.

<p/>If he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) had been wavering before as to what he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) should do, which had
often seemed likely, the advice and entreaty of so near a
relation might settle every doubt, and determine him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) at once to
be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>). In that case
he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) would return no more. Lady Catherine might see him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) in her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) way
through town; and his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) engagement to Bingley of coming again to
Netherfield must give way.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If, therefore, an excuse for not keeping his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) promise should come
to his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) friend within a few days,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) added, "I shall know how to
understand it. I shall then give over every expectation, every
wish of his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) constancy. If he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) is satisfied with only regretting
me, when he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) might have obtained my affections and hand, I shall
soon cease to regret him (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) at all."

<p/>The surprise of the rest of the family, on hearing who their
visitor had been, was very great; but they obligingly satisfied
it, with the same kind of supposition which had appeased Mrs.
Bennet’s curiosity; and Elizabeth was spared from much teasing on
the subject.

<p/>The next morning, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was going downstairs, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was met by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
father, who came out of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) library with a letter in his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) hand.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"I was going to look for you; come into my
room."

 (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div><p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) followed him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) thither; and her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) curiosity to know what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) had
to tell her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) was heightened by the supposition of its being in
some manner connected with the letter he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) held. It suddenly struck
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) that it might be from Lady Catherine; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) anticipated
with dismay all the consequent explanations.

<p/>She (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) father to the fire place, and they both sat
down. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) then said,

<p/>"I have received a letter this morning that has astonished me
exceedingly. As it principally concerns yourself, you ought to
know its contents. I did not know before, that I had _two_
daughters on the brink of matrimony. Let me congratulate you on a
very important conquest."

<p/>The colour now rushed into Elizabeth’s cheeks in the
instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew,
instead of the aunt; and she (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) was undetermined whether most to be
pleased that he (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) explained himself at all, or offended that his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>)
letter was not rather addressed to herself; when her (<font color='blue'><b>aunt</b></font>) father
continued:

<p/>"You look conscious. Young ladies have great penetration in such
matters as these; but I think I may defy even _your_ sagacity, to
discover the name of your admirer. This letter is from Mr.
Collins."

<p/>"From Mr. Collins! and what can _he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_ have to say?"

<p/>"Something very much to the purpose of course. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) begins with
congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest
daughter, of which, it seems, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) has been told by some of the
good-natured, gossiping Lucases. I shall not sport with your
impatience, by reading what he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) says on that point. What relates
to yourself, is as follows: <div class="bookquote">‘Having thus offered you the sincere
congratulations of Mrs. Collins and myself on this happy event,
let me now add a short hint on the subject of another; of which
we have been advertised by the same authority. Your daughter
Elizabeth, it is presumed, will not long bear the name of Bennet,
after her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) elder sister has resigned it, and the chosen partner of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most
illustrious personages in this land.’

 (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div><p/>"Can you possibly guess, Lizzy, who is meant by this? <div class="bookquote">‘This young
gentleman is blessed, in a peculiar way, with every thing the
heart of mortal can most desire,—splendid property, noble
kindred, and extensive patronage. Yet in spite of all these
temptations, let me warn my cousin Elizabeth, and yourself, of
what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this
gentleman’s proposals, which, of course, you will be inclined to
take immediate advantage of.’

 (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div><p/>"Have you any idea, Lizzy, who this gentleman is? But now it
comes out:

<p/>"<div class="bookquote">‘My motive for cautioning you is as follows. We have reason to
imagine that his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) aunt, Lady Catherine de Bourgh, does not look on
the match with a friendly eye.’

 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy</b></font>)</div><p/>"_Mr. Darcy_, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I _have_
surprised you. Could he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), or the Lucases, have pitched on any man
within the circle of our acquaintance, whose name would have
given the lie more effectually to what they related? Mr. Darcy,
who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish, and who
probably never looked at _you_ in his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) life! It is admirable!"

<p/>Elizabeth tried to join in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father’s pleasantry, but could
only force one most reluctant smile. Never had his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wit been
directed in a manner so little agreeable to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Are you not diverted?"

 (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div><p/>"Oh! yes. Pray read on."

<p/>"<div class="bookquote">‘After mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
ladyship last night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) immediately, with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) usual
condescension, expressed what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt on the occasion; when it
became apparent, that on the score of some family objections on
the part of my cousin, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would never give her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) consent to what
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) termed so disgraceful a match. I thought it my duty to give
the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
noble admirer may be aware of what they are about, and not run
hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned.’
 (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>Mr. Collins moreover adds, <div class="bookquote">‘I am truly rejoiced that my cousin
Lydia’s sad business has been so well hushed up, and am only
concerned that their living together before the marriage took
place should be so generally known. I must not, however, neglect
the duties of my station, or refrain from declaring my amazement
at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as
soon as they were married. It was an encouragement of vice; and
had I been the rector of Longbourn, I should very strenuously
have opposed it. You ought certainly to forgive them, as a
Christian, but never to admit them in your sight, or allow their
names to be mentioned in your hearing.’  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Collins</b></font>)</div>_That_ is his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) notion of
Christian forgiveness! The rest of his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) letter is only about his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>)
dear Charlotte’s situation, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Christian</b></font>) expectation of a young
olive-branch. But, Lizzy, you look as if you did not enjoy it.
You are not going to be _missish_, I hope, and pretend to be
affronted at an idle report. For what do we live, but to make
sport for our neighbours, and laugh at them in our turn?"

<p/>"Oh!" cried Elizabeth, "I am excessively diverted. But it is so
strange!"

<p/>"Yes—_that_ is what makes it amusing. Had they fixed on any other
man it would have been nothing; but _his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)_ perfect indifference,
and _your_ pointed dislike, make it so delightfully absurd! Much
as I abominate writing, I would not give up Mr. Collins’s
correspondence for any consideration. Nay, when I read a letter
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>), I cannot help giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the preference even over
Wickham, much as I value the impudence and hypocrisy of my
son-in-law. And pray, Lizzy, what said Lady Catherine about this
report? Did she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) call to refuse her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) consent?"

<p/>To this question his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) daughter replied only with a laugh; and as
it had been asked without the least suspicion, she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was not
distressed by his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) repeating it. Elizabeth had never been more at
a loss to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) feelings appear what they were not. It was
necessary to laugh, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would rather have cried. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father
had most cruelly mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), by what he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) said of Mr. Darcy’s
indifference, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could do nothing but wonder at such a want
of penetration, or fear that perhaps, instead of his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) seeing too
_little_, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) might have fancied too _much_.
