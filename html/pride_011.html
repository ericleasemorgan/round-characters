<p/>When the ladies removed after dinner, Elizabeth ran up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sister, and seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) well guarded from cold, attended her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) into
the drawing-room, where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was welcomed by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) two friends with
many professions of pleasure; and Elizabeth had never seen them
so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the
gentlemen appeared. Their powers of conversation were
considerable. They could describe an entertainment with accuracy,
relate an anecdote with humour, and laugh at their acquaintance
with spirit.

<p/>But when the gentlemen entered, Jane was no longer the first
object; Miss Bingley’s eyes were instantly turned toward Darcy,
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had something to say to him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) before he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had advanced many
steps. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) addressed himself to Miss Bennet, with a polite
congratulation; Mr. Hurst also made her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) a slight bow, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>)
was "very glad;" but diffuseness and warmth remained for
Bingley’s salutation. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) was full of joy and attention. The first
half-hour was spent in piling up the fire, lest she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) should suffer
from the change of room; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) removed at his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) desire to the
other side of the fireplace, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might be further from the
door. He (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) then sat down by her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>), and talked scarcely to anyone
else. Elizabeth, at work in the opposite corner, saw it all with
great delight.

<p/>When tea was over, Mr. Hurst reminded his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister-in-law of the
card-table—but in vain. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) had obtained private intelligence
that Mr. Darcy did not wish for cards; and Mr. Hurst soon found
even his (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) open petition rejected. She (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) assured him (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) that no one
intended to play, and the silence of the whole party on the
subject seemed to justify her (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>). Mr. Hurst had therefore nothing to
do, but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep.
Darcy took up a book; Miss Bingley did the same; and Mrs. Hurst,
principally occupied in playing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) bracelets and rings,
joined now and then in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) brother’s conversation with Miss
Bennet.

<p/>Miss Bingley’s attention was quite as much engaged in watching
Mr. Darcy’s progress through _his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)_ book, as in reading her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own;
and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was perpetually either making some enquiry, or looking at
his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) page. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not win him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), however, to any conversation; he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
merely answered her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) question, and read on. At length, quite
exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own book, which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had only chosen because it was the second volume of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
gave a great yawn and said, "How pleasant it is to spend an
evening in this way! I declare after all there is no enjoyment
like reading! How much sooner one tires of anything than of a
book! When I have a house of my own, I shall be miserable if I
have not an excellent library."

<p/>No one made any reply. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) then yawned again, threw aside her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
book, and cast her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) eyes round the room in quest for some
amusement; when hearing her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother mentioning a ball to Miss
Bennet, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) turned suddenly towards him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) and said:

<p/>"By the bye, Charles, are you really serious in meditating a
dance at Netherfield? I would advise you, before you determine on
it, to consult the wishes of the present party; I am much
mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be
rather a punishment than a pleasure."

<p/>"If you mean Darcy,<div class="bookquote">" cried her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) brother, " (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may go to bed, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
chooses, before it begins—but as for the ball, it is quite a
settled thing; and as soon as Nicholls has made white soup
enough, I shall send round my cards."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I should like balls infinitely better,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) replied, "if they
were carried on in a different manner; but there is something
insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting. It
would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of
dancing were made the order of the day."

<p/>"Much more rational, my dear Caroline, I dare say, but it would
not be near so much like a ball."

<p/>Miss Bingley made no answer, and soon afterwards she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) got up and
walked about the room. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) figure was elegant, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) walked
well; but Darcy, at whom it was all aimed, was still inflexibly
studious. In the desperation of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) feelings, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) resolved on one
effort more, and, turning to Elizabeth, said:

<p/>"Miss Eliza Bennet, let me persuade you to follow my example, and
take a turn about the room. I assure you it is very refreshing
after sitting so long in one attitude."

<p/>Elizabeth was surprised, but agreed to it immediately. Miss
Bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) civility; Mr.
Darcy looked up. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was as much awake to the novelty of attention
in that quarter as Elizabeth herself could be, and unconsciously
closed his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) book. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) was directly invited to join their party, but
he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) declined it, observing that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could imagine but two motives
for their choosing to walk up and down the room together, with
either of which motives his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) joining them would interfere. "What
could he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mean? She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was dying to know what could be his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
meaning?<div class="bookquote">"—and asked Elizabeth whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could at all understand
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)?

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>Not at all," was her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) answer; "but depend upon it, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) means to be
severe on us, and our surest way of disappointing him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) will be to
ask nothing about it.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Miss Bingley, however, was incapable of disappointing Mr. Darcy
in anything, and persevered therefore in requiring an explanation
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) two motives.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I have not the smallest objection to explaining them," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),
as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) allowed him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to speak. "You either choose this
method of passing the evening because you are in each other’s
confidence, and have secret affairs to discuss, or because you
are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage
in walking; if the first, I would be completely in your way, and
if the second, I can admire you much better as I sit by the
fire."

<p/>"Oh! shocking!<div class="bookquote">" cried Miss Bingley. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I never heard anything so
abominable. How shall we punish him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) for such a speech?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Nothing so easy, if you have but the inclination,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said
Elizabeth. "We can all plague and punish one another. Tease
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)—laugh at him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Intimate as you are, you must know how it is to
be done."

<p/>"But upon my honour, I do _not_. I do assure you that my intimacy
has not yet taught me _that_. Tease calmness of manner and
presence of mind! No, no; I feel he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may defy us there. And as to
laughter, we will not expose ourselves, if you please, by
attempting to laugh without a subject. Mr. Darcy may hug
himself.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>Mr. Darcy is not to be laughed at!<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>That is an
uncommon advantage, and uncommon I hope it will continue, for it
would be a great loss to _me_ to have many such acquaintances. I
dearly love a laugh."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Bingley,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>acquaintances</b></font>), "has given me more credit than can be.
The wisest and the best of men—nay, the wisest and best of their
actions—may be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object
in life is a joke."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Certainly,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth—"there are such people, but I hope
I am not one of _them_. I hope I never ridicule what is wise and
good. Follies and nonsense, whims and inconsistencies, _do_
divert me, I own, and I laugh at them whenever I can. But these,
I suppose, are precisely what you are without."

<p/>"Perhaps that is not possible for anyone. But it has been the
study of my life to avoid those weaknesses which often expose a
strong understanding to ridicule."

<p/>"Such as vanity and pride."

<p/>"Yes, vanity is a weakness indeed. But pride—where there is a
real superiority of mind, pride will be always under good
regulation.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth turned away to hide a smile.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>Your examination of Mr. Darcy is over, I presume," said Miss
Bingley; "and pray what is the result?"

<p/>"I am perfectly convinced by it that Mr. Darcy has no defect. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
owns it himself without disguise."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"No,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Darcy/Darcy</b></font>)</div>said Darcy, "I have made no such pretension. I have faults
enough, but they are not, I hope, of understanding. My temper I
dare not vouch for. It is, I believe, too little
yielding—certainly too little for the convenience of the world. I
cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as I ought,
nor their offenses against myself. My feelings are not puffed
about with every attempt to move them. My temper would perhaps be
called resentful. My good opinion once lost, is lost forever."

<p/>"_That_ is a failing indeed!<div class="bookquote">" cried Elizabeth. " (<font color='red'><b>a character</b></font>)</div>Implacable
resentment _is_ a shade in a character. But you have chosen your
fault well. I really cannot _laugh_ at it. You are safe from me."

<p/>"There is, I believe, in every disposition a tendency to some
particular evil—a natural defect, which not even the best
education can overcome."

<p/>"And _your_ defect is to hate everybody."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And yours,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) replied with a smile, "is willfully to
misunderstand them."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Do let us have a little music,"  (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley/Bingley</b></font>)</div>cried Miss Bingley, tired of a
conversation in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had no share. "Louisa, you will not
mind my waking Mr. Hurst?"

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Louisa</b></font>) sister had not the smallest objection, and the pianoforte was
opened; and Darcy, after a few moments’ recollection, was not
sorry for it. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) began to feel the danger of paying Elizabeth too
much attention.
