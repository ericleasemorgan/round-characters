<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dear Lizzy, where can you have been walking to?"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>was a
question which Elizabeth received from Jane as soon as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
entered their room, and from all the others when they sat down to
table. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had only to say in reply, that they had wandered
about, till she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was beyond her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own knowledge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) coloured as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
spoke; but neither that, nor anything else, awakened a suspicion
of the truth.

<p/>The evening passed quietly, unmarked by anything extraordinary.
The acknowledged lovers talked and laughed, the unacknowledged
were silent. Darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness
overflows in mirth; and Elizabeth, agitated and confused, rather
_knew_ that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was happy than _felt_ herself to be so; for,
besides the immediate embarrassment, there were other evils
before her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) anticipated what would be felt in the family when
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) situation became known; she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was aware that no one liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
but Jane; and even feared that with the others it was a _dislike_
which not all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) fortune and consequence might do away.

<p/>At night she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) opened her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart to Jane. Though suspicion was very
far from Miss Bennet’s general habits, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was absolutely
incredulous here.

<p/>"You are joking, Lizzy. This cannot be!—engaged to Mr. Darcy! No,
no, you shall not deceive me. I know it to be impossible."

<p/>"This is a wretched beginning indeed! My sole dependence was on
you; and I am sure nobody else will believe me, if you do not.
Yet, indeed, I am in earnest. I speak nothing but the truth. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
still loves me, and we are engaged.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Jane looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) doubtingly. " (<font color='red'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)</div>Oh, Lizzy! it cannot be. I know
how much you dislike him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/>"You know nothing of the matter. _That_ is all to be forgot.
Perhaps I did not always love him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) so well as I do now. But in
such cases as these, a good memory is unpardonable. This is the
last time I shall ever remember it myself."

<p/>Miss Bennet still looked all amazement. Elizabeth again, and more
seriously assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) of its truth.

<p/>"Good Heaven! can it be really so! Yet now I must believe you,<div class="bookquote">"
cried Jane. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>My dear, dear Lizzy, I would—I do congratulate
you—but are you certain? forgive the question—are you quite
certain that you can be happy with him (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)?"

<p/>"There can be no doubt of that. It is settled between us already,
that we are to be the happiest couple in the world. But are you
pleased, Jane? Shall you like to have such a brother?"

<p/>"Very, very much. Nothing could give either Bingley or myself
more delight. But we considered it, we talked of it as
impossible. And do you really love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) quite well enough? Oh,
Lizzy! do anything rather than marry without affection. Are you
quite sure that you feel what you ought to do?"

<p/>"Oh, yes! You will only think I feel _more_ than I ought to do,
when I tell you all."

<p/>"What do you mean?"

<p/>"Why, I must confess that I love him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) better than I do Bingley. I
am afraid you will be angry."

<p/>"My dearest sister, now _be_ serious. I want to talk very
seriously. Let me know every thing that I am to know, without
delay. Will you tell me how long you have loved him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)?"

<p/>"It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it
began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
beautiful grounds at Pemberley."

<p/>Another entreaty that she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) would be serious, however, produced the
desired effect; and she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) soon satisfied Jane by her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) solemn
assurances of attachment. When convinced on that article, Miss
Bennet had nothing further to wish.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Now I am quite happy,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), "for you will be as happy as
myself. I always had a value for him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>). Were it for nothing but his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>)
love of you, I must always have esteemed him (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>); but now, as
Bingley’s friend and your husband, there can be only Bingley and
yourself more dear to me. But Lizzy, you have been very sly, very
reserved with me. How little did you tell me of what passed at
Pemberley and Lambton! I owe all that I know of it to another,
not to you."

<p/>Elizabeth told her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) the motives of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) secrecy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been
unwilling to mention Bingley; and the unsettled state of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own
feelings had made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) equally avoid the name of his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) friend. But
now she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) would no longer conceal from her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) share in Lydia’s
marriage. All was acknowledged, and half the night spent in
conversation.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Good gracious!"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>cried Mrs. Bennet, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) stood at a window the
next morning, "if that disagreeable Mr. Darcy is not coming here
again with our dear Bingley! What can he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) mean by being so
tiresome as to be always coming here? I had no notion but he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
would go a-shooting, or something or other, and not disturb us
with his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) company. What shall we do with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)? Lizzy, you must walk
out with him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) again, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) may not be in Bingley’s way.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth could hardly help laughing at so convenient a proposal;
yet was really vexed that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother should be always giving him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
such an epithet.

<p/>As soon as they entered, Bingley looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) so expressively,
and shook hands with such warmth, as left no doubt of his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) good
information; and he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) soon afterwards said aloud, " (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>Mrs. Bennet,
have you no more lanes hereabouts in which Lizzy may lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) way
again to-day?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I advise Mr. Darcy, and Lizzy, and Kitty,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Bennet, "to
walk to Oakham Mount this morning. It is a nice long walk, and
Mr. Darcy has never seen the view."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It may do very well for the others,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr.</b></font>)</div>replied Mr. Bingley; "but I
am sure it will be too much for Kitty. Won’t it, Kitty?" Kitty
owned that she (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) had rather stay at home. Darcy professed a great
curiosity to see the view from the Mount, and Elizabeth silently
consented. As she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) went up stairs to get ready, Mrs. Bennet
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), saying:

<p/>"I am quite sorry, Lizzy, that you should be forced to have that
disagreeable man all to yourself. But I hope you will not mind
it: it is all for Jane’s sake, you know; and there is no occasion
for talking to him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), except just now and then. So, do not put
yourself to inconvenience.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>During their walk, it was resolved that Mr. Bennet’s consent
should be asked in the course of the evening. Elizabeth reserved
to herself the application for her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could not
determine how her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother would take it; sometimes doubting
whether all his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) abhorrence of the man. But whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) were violently set
against the match, or violently delighted with it, it was certain
that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
sense; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could no more bear that Mr. Darcy should hear the
first raptures of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) joy, than the first vehemence of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
disapprobation.

<p/>In the evening, soon after Mr. Bennet withdrew to the library,
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw Mr. Darcy rise also and follow him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), and her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) agitation on
seeing it was extreme. She (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not fear her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father’s opposition,
but he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) was going to be made unhappy; and that it should be
through her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) means—that _she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)_, his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) favourite child, should be
distressing him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) by her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) choice, should be filling him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) with fears
and regrets in disposing of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)—was a wretched reflection, and
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sat in misery till Mr. Darcy appeared again, when, looking at
him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was a little relieved by his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) smile. In a few minutes he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)
approached the table where she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was sitting with Kitty; and, while
pretending to admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) work said in a whisper, " (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>Go to your
father, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) wants you in the library." She (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) was gone directly.

<p/>Her (<font color='blue'><b>Kitty</b></font>) father was walking about the room, looking grave and anxious.
<div class="bookquote">"Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>), "what are you doing? Are you out of your
senses, to be accepting this man? Have not you always hated him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)?"

<p/>How earnestly did she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) then wish that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) former opinions had been
more reasonable, her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) expressions more moderate! It would have
spared her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) from explanations and professions which it was
exceedingly awkward to give; but they were now necessary, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>)
assured him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>), with some confusion, of her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) attachment to Mr. Darcy.

<p/>"Or, in other words, you are determined to have him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is rich,
to be sure, and you may have more fine clothes and fine carriages
than Jane. But will they make you happy?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Have you any other objection,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>said Elizabeth, "than your belief
of my indifference?<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>None at all. We all know him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to be a proud, unpleasant sort of
man; but this would be nothing if you really liked him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I do, I do like him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) replied, with tears in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) eyes, "I
love him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>). Indeed he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) has no improper pride. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) is perfectly
amiable. You do not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) really is; then pray do not pain
me by speaking of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) in such terms."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Lizzy,"  (<font color='red'><b>father</b></font>)</div>said her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) father, "I have given him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) my consent. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) is the
kind of man, indeed, to whom I should never dare refuse anything,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) condescended to ask. I now give it to _you_, if you are
resolved on having him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). But let me advise you to think better of
it. I know your disposition, Lizzy. I know that you could be
neither happy nor respectable, unless you truly esteemed your
husband; unless you looked up to him (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) as a superior. Your lively
talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal
marriage. You could scarcely escape discredit and misery. My
child, let me not have the grief of seeing _you_ unable to
respect your partner in life. You know not what you are about.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Elizabeth, still more affected, was earnest and solemn in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
reply; and at length, by repeated assurances that Mr. Darcy was
really the object of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) choice, by explaining the gradual change
which her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) estimation of him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had undergone, relating her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) absolute
certainty that his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) affection was not the work of a day, but had
stood the test of many months’ suspense, and enumerating with
energy all his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) good qualities, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did conquer her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father’s
incredulity, and reconcile him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) to the match.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Well, my dear," said he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>), when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) ceased speaking, "I have no
more to say. If this be the case, he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) deserves you. I could not
have parted with you, my Lizzy, to anyone less worthy."

<p/>To complete the favourable impression, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) then told him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) what Mr.
Darcy had voluntarily done for Lydia. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Lydia</b></font>) with
astonishment.

<p/>"This is an evening of wonders, indeed! And so, Darcy did every
thing; made up the match, gave the money, paid the fellow’s
debts, and got him (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) commission! So much the better. It will
save me a world of trouble and economy. Had it been your uncle’s
doing, I must and _would_ have paid him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>); but these violent young
lovers carry every thing their own way. I shall offer to pay him (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
to-morrow; he (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) will rant and storm about his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) love for you, and
there will be an end of the matter."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) then recollected her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) embarrassment a few days before, on his (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>)
reading Mr. Collins’s letter; and after laughing at her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) some
time, allowed her (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) at last to go—saying, as she (<font color='blue'><b>uncle</b></font>) quitted the room,
"If any young men come for Mary or Kitty, send them in, for I am
quite at leisure."

<p/>Elizabeth’s mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight; and,
after half an hour’s quiet reflection in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
able to join the others with tolerable composure. Every thing was
too recent for gaiety, but the evening passed tranquilly away;
there was no longer anything material to be dreaded, and the
comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time.

<p/>When her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother went up to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) dressing-room at night, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), and made the important communication. Its effect
was most extraordinary; for on first hearing it, Mrs. Bennet sat
quite still, and unable to utter a syllable. Nor was it under
many, many minutes that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) could comprehend what she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) heard;
though not in general backward to credit what was for the
advantage of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) family, or that came in the shape of a lover to
any of them. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) began at length to recover, to fidget about in
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) chair, get up, sit down again, wonder, and bless herself.

<p/>"Good gracious! Lord bless me! only think! dear me! Mr. Darcy!
Who would have thought it! And is it really true? Oh! my sweetest
Lizzy! how rich and how great you will be! What pin-money, what
jewels, what carriages you will have! Jane’s is nothing to
it—nothing at all. I am so pleased—so happy. Such a charming
man!—so handsome! so tall!—Oh, my dear Lizzy! pray apologise for
my having disliked him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) so much before. I hope he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) will overlook
it. Dear, dear Lizzy. A house in town! Every thing that is
charming! Three daughters married! Ten thousand a year! Oh, Lord!
What will become of me. I shall go distracted."

<p/>This was enough to prove that her (<font color='blue'><b>Lizzy</b></font>) approbation need not be
doubted: and Elizabeth, rejoicing that such an effusion was heard
only by herself, soon went away. But before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had been three
minutes in her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) own room, her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother followed her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"My dearest child,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) cried, "I can think of nothing else! Ten
thousand a year, and very likely more! ’Tis as good as a Lord!
And a special licence. You must and shall be married by a special
licence. But my dearest love, tell me what dish Mr. Darcy is
particularly fond of, that I may have it to-morrow."

<p/>This was a sad omen of what her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother’s behaviour to the
gentleman himself might be; and Elizabeth found that, though in
the certain possession of his (<font color='blue'><b>gentleman</b></font>) warmest affection, and secure of
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) relations’ consent, there was still something to be wished
for. But the morrow passed off much better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) expected; for
Mrs. Bennet luckily stood in such awe of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) intended son-in-law
that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) ventured not to speak to him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>), unless it was in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) power
to offer him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>) any attention, or mark her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) deference for his (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>)
opinion.

<p/>Elizabeth had the satisfaction of seeing her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) father taking pains
to get acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>son</b></font>); and Mr. Bennet soon assured her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) that
he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was rising every hour in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) esteem.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I admire all my three sons-in-law highly,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"Wickham,
perhaps, is my favourite; but I think I shall like _your_ husband
quite as well as Jane’s."
