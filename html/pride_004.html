<p/>When Jane and Elizabeth were alone, the former, who had been
cautious in her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) praise of Mr. Bingley before, expressed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
sister just how very much she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) admired him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>).

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is just what a young man ought to be,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), "sensible,
good-humoured, lively; and I never saw such happy manners!—so
much ease, with such perfect good breeding!"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) is also handsome,"  (<font color='red'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)</div>replied Elizabeth, "which a young man
ought likewise to be, if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) possibly can. His (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) character is
thereby complete."

<p/>"I was very much flattered by his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking me to dance a second
time. I did not expect such a compliment."

<p/>"Did not you? _I_ did for you. But that is one great difference
between us. Compliments always take _you_ by surprise, and _me_
never. What could be more natural than his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) asking you again? He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)
could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as
every other woman in the room. No thanks to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) gallantry for
that. Well, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) certainly is very agreeable, and I give you leave
to like him (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>). You have liked many a stupider person."

<p/>"Dear Lizzy!"

<p/>"Oh! you are a great deal too apt, you know, to like people in
general. You never see a fault in anybody. All the world are good
and agreeable in your eyes. I never heard you speak ill of a
human being in your life."

<p/>"I would not wish to be hasty in censuring anyone; but I always
speak what I think."

<p/>"I know you do; and it is _that_ which makes the wonder. With
_your_ good sense, to be so honestly blind to the follies and
nonsense of others! Affectation of candour is common enough—one
meets with it everywhere. But to be candid without ostentation or
design—to take the good of everybody’s character and make it
still better, and say nothing of the bad—belongs to you alone.
And so you like this man’s sisters, too, do you? Their manners
are not equal to his (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>)."

<p/>"Certainly not—at first. But they are very pleasing women when
you converse with them. Miss Bingley is to live with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother,
and keep his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) house; and I am much mistaken if we shall not find a
very charming neighbour in her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)."

<p/>Elizabeth listened in silence, but was not convinced; their
behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in
general; and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy
of temper than her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, and with a judgement too unassailed by
any attention to herself, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was very little disposed to approve
them. They were in fact very fine ladies; not deficient in good
humour when they were pleased, nor in the power of making
themselves agreeable when they chose it, but proud and conceited.
They were rather handsome, had been educated in one of the first
private seminaries in town, had a fortune of twenty thousand
pounds, were in the habit of spending more than they ought, and
of associating with people of rank, and were therefore in every
respect entitled to think well of themselves, and meanly of
others. They were of a respectable family in the north of
England; a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories
than that their brother’s fortune and their own had been acquired
by trade.

<p/>Mr. Bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred
thousand pounds from his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) father, who had intended to purchase an
estate, but did not live to do it. Mr. Bingley intended it
likewise, and sometimes made choice of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) county; but as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was
now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor, it was
doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>)
temper, whether he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) might not spend the remainder of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) days at
Netherfield, and leave the next generation to purchase.

<p/>His (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) sisters were anxious for his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) having an estate of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own;
but, though he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was now only established as a tenant, Miss Bingley
was by no means unwilling to preside at his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) table—nor was Mrs.
Hurst, who had married a man of more fashion than fortune, less
disposed to consider his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) house as her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) home when it suited her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>).
Mr. Bingley had not been of age two years, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was tempted by
an accidental recommendation to look at Netherfield House. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) did
look at it, and into it for half-an-hour—was pleased with the
situation and the principal rooms, satisfied with what the owner
said in its praise, and took it immediately.

<p/>Between him (<font color='blue'><b>owner</b></font>) and Darcy there was a very steady friendship, in
spite of great opposition of character. Bingley was endeared to
Darcy by the easiness, openness, and ductility of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) temper,
though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own,
and though with his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) own he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) never appeared dissatisfied. On the
strength of Darcy’s regard, Bingley had the firmest reliance, and
of his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) judgement the highest opinion. In understanding, Darcy was
the superior. Bingley was by no means deficient, but Darcy was
clever. He (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) was at the same time haughty, reserved, and
fastidious, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) manners, though well-bred, were not inviting.
In that respect his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) friend had greatly the advantage. Bingley was
sure of being liked wherever he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) appeared, Darcy was continually
giving offense.

<p/>The manner in which they spoke of the Meryton assembly was
sufficiently characteristic. Bingley had never met with more
pleasant people or prettier girls in his (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) life; everybody had been
most kind and attentive to him (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>); there had been no formality, no
stiffness; he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) had soon felt acquainted with all the room; and, as
to Miss Bennet, he (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) could not conceive an angel more beautiful.
Darcy, on the contrary, had seen a collection of people in whom
there was little beauty and no fashion, for none of whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) had
felt the smallest interest, and from none received either
attention or pleasure. Miss Bennet he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) acknowledged to be pretty,
but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) smiled too much.

<p/>Mrs. Hurst and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) sister allowed it to be so—but still they
admired her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) and liked her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>), and pronounced her (<font color='blue'><b>Hurst</b></font>) to be a sweet girl,
and one whom they would not object to know more of. Miss Bennet
was therefore established as a sweet girl, and their brother felt
authorized by such commendation to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) as he (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) chose.
