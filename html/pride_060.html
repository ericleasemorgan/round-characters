<p/>Elizabeth’s spirits soon rising to playfulness again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) wanted
Mr. Darcy to account for his (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) having ever fallen in love with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>).
<div class="bookquote">"How could you begin?"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). <div class="bookquote">"I can comprehend your going on
charmingly, when you had once made a beginning; but what could
set you off in the first place?"

 (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div><p/>"I cannot fix on the hour, or the spot, or the look, or the
words, which laid the foundation. It is too long ago. I was in
the middle before I knew that I _had_ begun."

<p/>"My beauty you had early withstood, and as for my manners—my
behaviour to _you_ was at least always bordering on the uncivil,
and I never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain
than not. Now be sincere; did you admire me for my impertinence?"

<p/>"For the liveliness of your mind, I did."

<p/>"You may as well call it impertinence at once. It was very little
less. The fact is, that you were sick of civility, of deference,
of officious attention. You were disgusted with the women who
were always speaking, and looking, and thinking for _your_
approbation alone. I roused, and interested you, because I was so
unlike _them_. Had you not been really amiable, you would have
hated me for it; but in spite of the pains you took to disguise
yourself, your feelings were always noble and just; and in your
heart, you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously
courted you. There—I have saved you the trouble of accounting for
it; and really, all things considered, I begin to think it
perfectly reasonable. To be sure, you knew no actual good of
me—but nobody thinks of _that_ when they fall in love."

<p/>"Was there no good in your affectionate behaviour to Jane while
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was ill at Netherfield?"

<p/>"Dearest Jane! who could have done less for her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)? But make a
virtue of it by all means. My good qualities are under your
protection, and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible;
and, in return, it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing
and quarrelling with you as often as may be; and I shall begin
directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the
point at last. What made you so shy of me, when you first called,
and afterwards dined here? Why, especially, when you called, did
you look as if you did not care about me?"

<p/>"Because you were grave and silent, and gave me no
encouragement."

<p/>"But I was embarrassed."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"And so was I."

 (<font color='red'><b>me</b></font>)</div><p/>"You might have talked to me more when you came to dinner."

<p/>"A man who had felt less, might."

<p/>"How unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give,
and that I should be so reasonable as to admit it! But I wonder
how long you _would_ have gone on, if you had been left to
yourself. I wonder when you _would_ have spoken, if I had not
asked you! My resolution of thanking you for your kindness to
Lydia had certainly great effect. _Too much_, I am afraid; for
what becomes of the moral, if our comfort springs from a breach
of promise? for I ought not to have mentioned the subject. This
will never do."

<p/>"You need not distress yourself. The moral will be perfectly
fair. Lady Catherine’s unjustifiable endeavours to separate us
were the means of removing all my doubts. I am not indebted for
my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your
gratitude. I was not in a humour to wait for any opening of
yours. My aunt’s intelligence had given me hope, and I was
determined at once to know every thing."

<p/>"Lady Catherine has been of infinite use, which ought to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
happy, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>) loves to be of use. But tell me, what did you come
down to Netherfield for? Was it merely to ride to Longbourn and
be embarrassed? or had you intended any more serious
consequence?"

<p/>"My real purpose was to see _you_, and to judge, if I could,
whether I might ever hope to make you love me. My avowed one, or
what I avowed to myself, was to see whether your sister were
still partial to Bingley, and if she (<font color='blue'><b>sister</b></font>) were, to make the confession
to him (<font color='blue'><b>me</b></font>) which I have since made."

<p/>"Shall you ever have courage to announce to Lady Catherine what
is to befall her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)?"

<p/>"I am more likely to want  time than courage, Elizabeth. But it
ought to be done, and if you will give me a sheet of paper, it
shall be done directly."

<p/>"And if I had not a letter to write myself, I might sit by you
and admire the evenness of your writing, as another young lady
once did. But I have an aunt, too, who must not be longer
neglected."

<p/>From an unwillingness to confess how much her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) intimacy with Mr.
Darcy had been over-rated, Elizabeth had never yet answered Mrs.
Gardiner’s long letter; but now, having _that_ to communicate
which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) knew would be most welcome, she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was almost ashamed to
find that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) uncle and aunt had already lost three days of
happiness, and immediately wrote as follows:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I would have thanked you before, my dear aunt, as I ought to
have done, for your long, kind, satisfactory, detail of
particulars; but to say the truth, I was too cross to write. You
supposed more than really existed. But _now_ suppose as much as
you choose; give a loose rein to your fancy, indulge your
imagination in every possible flight which the subject will
afford, and unless you believe me actually married, you cannot
greatly err. You must write again very soon, and praise him (<font color='blue'><b>You</b></font>) a
great deal more than you did in your last. I thank you, again and
again, for not going to the Lakes. How could I be so silly as to
wish it! Your idea of the ponies is delightful. We will go round
the Park every day. I am the happiest creature in the world.
Perhaps other people have said so before, but not one with such
justice. I am happier even than Jane; she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) only smiles, I laugh.
Mr. Darcy sends you all the love in the world that he (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) can spare
from me. You are all to come to Pemberley at Christmas. Yours,
etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>aunt</b></font>)</div><p/>Mr. Darcy’s letter to Lady Catherine was in a different style;
and still different from either was what Mr. Bennet sent to Mr.
Collins, in reply to his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) last.

<p/>"Dear Sir,
"I must trouble you once more for congratulations. Elizabeth will
soon be the wife of Mr. Darcy. Console Lady Catherine as well as
you can. But, if I were you, I would stand by the nephew. He (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) has
more to give.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yours sincerely, etc."

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bingley</b></font>)</div><p/>Miss Bingley’s congratulations to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) brother, on his (<font color='blue'><b>brother</b></font>) approaching
marriage, were all that was affectionate and insincere. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) wrote
even to Jane on the occasion, to express her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) delight, and repeat
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Bingley</b></font>) former professions of regard. Jane was not deceived, but
she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was affected; and though feeling no reliance on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>), could
not help writing her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) a much kinder answer than she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) knew was
deserved.

<p/>The joy which Miss Darcy expressed on receiving similar
information, was as sincere as her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) brother’s in sending it. Four
sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) delight, and
all her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) earnest desire of being loved by her (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) sister.

<p/>Before any answer could arrive from Mr. Collins, or any
congratulations to Elizabeth from his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) wife, the Longbourn family
heard that the Collinses were come themselves to Lucas Lodge. The
reason of this sudden removal was soon evident. Lady Catherine
had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her (<font color='blue'><b>Catherine</b></font>)
nephew’s letter, that Charlotte, really rejoicing in the match,
was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over. At such a
moment, the arrival of her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) friend was a sincere pleasure to
Elizabeth, though in the course of their meetings she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) must
sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought, when she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) saw Mr.
Darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
husband. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) bore it, however, with admirable calmness. He (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) could
even listen to Sir William Lucas, when he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) complimented him (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) on
carrying away the brightest jewel of the country, and expressed
his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) hopes of their all meeting frequently at St. James’s, with
very decent composure. If he (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) did shrug his (<font color='blue'><b>James</b></font>) shoulders, it was not
till Sir William was out of sight.

<p/>Mrs. Phillips’s vulgarity was another, and perhaps a greater, tax
on his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) forbearance; and though Mrs. Phillips, as well as her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>)
sister, stood in too much awe of him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to speak with the
familiarity which Bingley’s good humour encouraged, yet, whenever
she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) _did_ speak, she (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) must be vulgar. Nor was her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) respect for him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>),
though it made her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) more quiet, at all likely to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Phillips</b></font>) more
elegant. Elizabeth did all she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could to shield him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) from the
frequent notice of either, and was ever anxious to keep him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) to
herself, and to those of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) family with whom he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) might converse
without mortification; and though the uncomfortable feelings
arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of
its pleasure, it added to the hope of the future; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) looked
forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from
society so little pleasing to either, to all the comfort and
elegance of their family party at Pemberley.
