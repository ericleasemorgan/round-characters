<p/>The next morning brought Mr. Frank Churchill again. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) came with Mrs. Weston, to whom and to Highbury he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) seemed to take very cordially. He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>), it appeared, most companionably at home, till her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) usual hour of exercise; and on being desired to chuse their walk, immediately fixed on Highbury. "He (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) did not doubt there being very pleasant walks in every direction, but if left to him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) should always chuse the same. Highbury, that airy, cheerful, happy-looking Highbury, would be his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) constant attraction." Highbury, with Mrs. Weston, stood for Hartfield; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) trusted to its bearing the same construction with him (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>). They walked thither directly.

<p/>Emma had hardly expected them: for Mr. Weston, who had called in for half a minute, in order to hear that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) son was very handsome, knew nothing of their plans; and it was an agreeable surprize to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), therefore, to perceive them walking up to the house together, arm in arm. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was wanting to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) again, and especially to see him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) in company with Mrs. Weston, upon his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) behaviour to whom her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) opinion of him (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was to depend. If he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) were deficient there, nothing should make amends for it. But on seeing them together, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) became perfectly satisfied. It was not merely in fine words or hyperbolical compliment that he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) paid his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) duty; nothing could be more proper or pleasing than his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) whole manner to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) nothing could more agreeably denote his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wish of considering her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) as a friend and securing her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) affection. And there was time enough for Emma to form a reasonable judgment, as their visit included all the rest of the morning. They were all three walking about together for an hour or two first round the shrubberies of Hartfield, and afterwards in Highbury. He (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was delighted with every thing; admired Hartfield sufficiently for Mr. Woodhouse's ear; and when their going farther was resolved on, confessed his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) wish to be made acquainted with the whole village, and found matter of commendation and interest much oftener than Emma could have supposed.

<p/>Some of the objects of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) curiosity spoke very amiable feelings. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) begged to be shewn the house which his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) father had lived in so long, and which had been the home of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) father's father; and on recollecting that an old woman who had nursed him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was still living, walked in quest of her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) cottage from one end of the street to the other; and though in some points of pursuit or observation there was no positive merit, they shewed, altogether, a good-will towards Highbury in general, which must be very like a merit to those he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was with.

<p/>Emma watched and decided, that with such feelings as were now shewn, it could not be fairly supposed that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had been ever voluntarily absenting himself; that he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had not been acting a part, or making a parade of insincere professions; and that Mr. Knightley certainly had not done him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) justice.

<p/>Their first pause was at the Crown Inn, an inconsiderable house, though the principal one of the sort, where a couple of pair of post-horses were kept, more for the convenience of the neighbourhood than from any run on the road; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) companions had not expected to be detained by any interest excited there; but in passing it they gave the history of the large room visibly added; it had been built many years ago for a ball-room, and while the neighbourhood had been in a particularly populous, dancing state, had been occasionally used as such; but such brilliant days had long passed away, and now the highest purpose for which it was ever wanted was to accommodate a whist club established among the gentlemen and half-gentlemen of the place. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was immediately interested. Its character as a ball-room caught him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>); and instead of passing on, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) stopt for several minutes at the two superior sashed windows which were open, to look in and contemplate its capabilities, and lament that its original purpose should have ceased. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saw no fault in the room, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) would acknowledge none which they suggested. No, it was long enough, broad enough, handsome enough. It would hold the very number for comfort. They ought to have balls there at least every fortnight through the winter. Why had not Miss Woodhouse revived the former good old days of the room? She (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) who could do any thing in Highbury! The want of proper families in the place, and the conviction that none beyond the place and its immediate environs could be tempted to attend, were mentioned; but he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was not satisfied. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could not be persuaded that so many good-looking houses as he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) saw around him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>), could not furnish numbers enough for such a meeting; and even when particulars were given and families described, he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was still unwilling to admit that the inconvenience of such a mixture would be any thing, or that there would be the smallest difficulty in every body's returning into their proper place the next morning. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) argued like a young man very much bent on dancing; and Emma was rather surprized to see the constitution of the Weston prevail so decidedly against the habits of the Churchills. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) seemed to have all the life and spirit, cheerful feelings, and social inclinations of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) father, and nothing of the pride or reserve of Enscombe. Of pride, indeed, there was, perhaps, scarcely enough; his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) indifference to a confusion of rank, bordered too much on inelegance of mind. He (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could be no judge, however, of the evil he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was holding cheap. It was but an effusion of lively spirits.

<p/>At last he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) was persuaded to move on from the front of the Crown; and being now almost facing the house where the Bateses lodged, Emma recollected his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) intended visit the day before, and asked him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) if he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) had paid it.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Yes, oh! yes"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) replied; "I was just going to mention it. A very successful visit: I saw all the three ladies; and felt very much obliged to you for your preparatory hint. If the talking aunt had taken me quite by surprize, it must have been the death of me. As it was, I was only betrayed into paying a most unreasonable visit. Ten minutes would have been all that was necessary, perhaps all that was proper; and I had told my father I should certainly be at home before him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) but there was no getting away, no pause; and, to my utter astonishment, I found, when he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) (finding me nowhere else) joined me there at last, that I had been actually sitting with them very nearly three-quarters of an hour. The good lady had not given me the possibility of escape before."

<p/>"And how did you think Miss Fairfax looking?"

<p/>"Ill, very ill that is, if a young lady can ever be allowed to look ill. But the expression is hardly admissible, Mrs. Weston, is it? Ladies can never look ill. And, seriously, Miss Fairfax is naturally so pale, as almost always to give the appearance of ill health. A most deplorable want of complexion.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>Emma would not agree to this, and began a warm defence of Miss Fairfax's complexion. " (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>It was certainly never brilliant, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not allow it to have a sickly hue in general; and there was a softness and delicacy in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) skin which gave peculiar elegance to the character of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) face." He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) listened with all due deference; acknowledged that he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) had heard many people say the same but yet he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) must confess, that to him (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) nothing could make amends for the want of the fine glow of health. Where features were indifferent, a fine complexion gave beauty to them all; and where they were good, the effect was fortunately he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) need not attempt to describe what the effect was.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Well,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "there is no disputing about taste. At least you admire her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) except her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complexion.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) shook his (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) head and laughed. " (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot separate Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) complexion."

<p/>"Did you see her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) often at Weymouth? Were you often in the same society?"

<p/>At this moment they were approaching Ford's, and he (<font color='blue'><b>character</b></font>) hastily exclaimed, "Ha! this must be the very shop that every body attends every day of their lives, as my father informs me. He (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) comes to Highbury himself, he (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) says, six days out of the seven, and has always business at Ford's. If it be not inconvenient to you, pray let us go in, that I may prove myself to belong to the place, to be a true citizen of Highbury. I must buy something at Ford's. It will be taking out my freedom. I dare say they sell gloves."

<p/>"Oh! yes, gloves and every thing. I do admire your patriotism. You will be adored in Highbury. You were very popular before you came, because you were Mr. Weston's son but lay out half a guinea at Ford's, and your popularity will stand upon your own virtues."

<p/>They went in; and while the sleek, well-tied parcels of <div class="bookquote">"Men's Beavers"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>and <div class="bookquote">"York Tan"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>were bringing down and displaying on the counter, he (<font color='blue'><b>Tan</b></font>) said "But I beg your pardon, Miss Woodhouse, you were speaking to me, you were saying something at the very moment of this burst of my amor patriae. Do not let me lose it. I assure you the utmost stretch of public fame would not make me amends for the loss of any happiness in private life."

<p/>"I merely asked, whether you had known much of Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Woodhouse</b></font>) party at Weymouth."

<p/>"And now that I understand your question, I must pronounce it to be a very unfair one. It is always the lady's right to decide on the degree of acquaintance. Miss Fairfax must already have given her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account. I shall not commit myself by claiming more than she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) may chuse to allow."

<p/>"Upon my word! you answer as discreetly as she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) could do herself. But her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) account of every thing leaves so much to be guessed, she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) is so very reserved, so very unwilling to give the least information about any body, that I really think you may say what you like of your acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)."

<p/>"May I, indeed? Then I will speak the truth, and nothing suits me so well. I met her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) frequently at Weymouth. I had known the Campbells a little in town; and at Weymouth we were very much in the same set. Colonel Campbell is a very agreeable man, and Mrs. Campbell a friendly, warm-hearted woman. I like them all."

<p/>"You know Miss Fairfax's situation in life, I conclude; what she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is destined to be?"

<p/>"Yes (rather hesitatingly) I believe I do."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"You get upon delicate subjects, Emma,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston/Weston</b></font>)</div>said Mrs. Weston smiling; "remember that I am here. Mr. Frank Churchill hardly knows what to say when you speak of Miss Fairfax's situation in life. I will move a little farther off."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I certainly do forget to think of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>),"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, "as having ever been any thing but my friend and my dearest friend.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked as if he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) fully understood and honoured such a sentiment.

<p/>When the gloves were bought, and they had quitted the shop again, " (<font color='red'><b>the lady</b></font>)</div>Did you ever hear the young lady we were speaking of, play?" said Frank Churchill.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Ever hear her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>)!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>repeated Emma. "You forget how much she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) belongs to Highbury. I have heard her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) every year of our lives since we both began. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) plays charmingly."

<p/>"You think so, do you? I wanted the opinion of some one who could really judge. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) appeared to me to play well, that is, with considerable taste, but I know nothing of the matter myself. I am excessively fond of music, but without the smallest skill or right of judging of any body's performance. I have been used to hear her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>)'s admired; and I remember one proof of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being thought to play well: a man, a very musical man, and in love with another woman engaged to her (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) on the point of marriage would yet never ask that other woman to sit down to the instrument, if the lady in question could sit down instead never seemed to like to hear one if he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could hear the other. That, I thought, in a man of known musical talent, was some proof."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Proof indeed!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, highly amused. "Mr. Dixon is very musical, is he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>)? We shall know more about them all, in half an hour, from you, than Miss Fairfax would have vouchsafed in half a year."

<p/>"Yes, Mr. Dixon and Miss Campbell were the persons; and I thought it a very strong proof."

<p/>"Certainly very strong it was; to own the truth, a great deal stronger than, if I had been Miss Campbell, would have been at all agreeable to me. I could not excuse a man's having more music than love more ear than eye a more acute sensibility to fine sounds than to my feelings. How did Miss Campbell appear to like it?"

<p/>"It was her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) very particular friend, you know."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor comfort!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, laughing. "One would rather have a stranger preferred than one's very particular friend with a stranger it might not recur again but the misery of having a very particular friend always at hand, to do every thing better than one does oneself! Poor Mrs. Dixon! Well, I am glad she (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) is gone to settle in Ireland."

<p/>"You are right. It was not very flattering to Miss Campbell; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) really did not seem to feel it."

<p/>"So much the better or so much the worse: I do not know which. But be it sweetness or be it stupidity in her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) quickness of friendship, or dulness of feeling there was one person, I think, who must have felt it: Miss Fairfax herself. She (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) must have felt the improper and dangerous distinction."

<p/>"As to that I do not "

<p/>"Oh! do not imagine that I expect an account of Miss Fairfax's sensations from you, or from any body else. They are known to no human being, I guess, but herself. But if she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) continued to play whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) was asked by Mr. Dixon, one may guess what one chuses."

<p/>"There appeared such a perfectly good understanding among them all " he (<font color='blue'><b>Dixon</b></font>) began rather quickly, but checking himself, added, "however, it is impossible for me to say on what terms they really were how it might all be behind the scenes. I can only say that there was smoothness outwardly. But you, who have known Miss Fairfax from a child, must be a better judge of her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) character, and of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) is likely to conduct herself in critical situations, than I can be."

<p/>"I have known her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) from a child, undoubtedly; we have been children and women together; and it is natural to suppose that we should be intimate, that we should have taken to each other whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) visited her (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) friends. But we never did. I hardly know how it has happened; a little, perhaps, from that wickedness on my side which was prone to take disgust towards a girl so idolized and so cried up as she (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) always was, by her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) aunt and grandmother, and all their set. And then, her (<font color='blue'><b>girl</b></font>) reserve I never could attach myself to any one so completely reserved."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"It is a most repulsive quality, indeed,"  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>said he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>). "Oftentimes very convenient, no doubt, but never pleasing. There is safety in reserve, but no attraction. One cannot love a reserved person."

<p/>"Not till the reserve ceases towards oneself; and then the attraction may be the greater. But I must be more in want of a friend, or an agreeable companion, than I have yet been, to take the trouble of conquering any body's reserve to procure one. Intimacy between Miss Fairfax and me is quite out of the question. I have no reason to think ill of her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>) not the least except that such extreme and perpetual cautiousness of word and manner, such a dread of giving a distinct idea about any body, is apt to suggest suspicions of there being something to conceal."

<p/>He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) perfectly agreed with her (<font color='blue'><b>I</b></font>): and after walking together so long, and thinking so much alike, Emma felt herself so well acquainted with him (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>), that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hardly believe it to be only their second meeting. He (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) was not exactly what she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected; less of the man of the world in some of his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) notions, less of the spoiled child of fortune, therefore better than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had expected. His (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) ideas seemed more moderate his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) feelings warmer. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was particularly struck by his (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) manner of considering Mr. Elton's house, which, as well as the church, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) would go and look at, and would not join them in finding much fault with. No, he (<font color='blue'><b>companion</b></font>) could not believe it a bad house; not such a house as a man was to be pitied for having. If it were to be shared with the woman he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) loved, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could not think any man to be pitied for having that house. There must be ample room in it for every real comfort. The man must be a blockhead who wanted more.

<p/>Mrs. Weston laughed, and said he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did not know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about. Used only to a large house himself, and without ever thinking how many advantages and accommodations were attached to its size, he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) could be no judge of the privations inevitably belonging to a small one. But Emma, in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own mind, determined that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) did know what he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) was talking about, and that he (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) shewed a very amiable inclination to settle early in life, and to marry, from worthy motives. He (<font color='blue'><b>man</b></font>) might not be aware of the inroads on domestic peace to be occasioned by no housekeeper's room, or a bad butler's pantry, but no doubt he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) did perfectly feel that Enscombe could not make him (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) happy, and that whenever he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) were attached, he (<font color='blue'><b>butler</b></font>) would willingly give up much of wealth to be allowed an early establishment.
