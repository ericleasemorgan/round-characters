<p/>Emma's pensive meditations, as she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) found those who must rouse her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) absence, and were sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father. Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,

<p/>"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the <div class="bookquote">'love,'  (<font color='red'><b>nobody</b></font>)</div>which nobody carries?"

<p/>"Nothing at all. But is not this a sudden scheme?"

<p/>"Yes rather I have been thinking of it some little time."

<p/>Emma was sure he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) had not forgiven her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) looked unlike himself. Time, however, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, would tell him (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) that they ought to be friends again. While he (<font color='blue'><b>John</b></font>) stood, as if meaning to go, but not going her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) father began his (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>) inquiries.

<p/>"Well, my dear, and did you get there safely? And how did you find my worthy old friend and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) daughter? I dare say they must have been very much obliged to you for coming. Dear Emma has been to call on Mrs. and Miss Bates, Mr. Knightley, as I told you before. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is always so attentive to them!"

<p/>Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) looked at Mr. Knightley. It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) favour, as if his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) eyes received the truth from hers, and all that had passed of good in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) feelings were at once caught and honoured.  He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) looked at her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) with a glow of regard. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was warmly gratified and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) part. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand; whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had not herself made the first motion, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not say she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might, perhaps, have rather offered it but he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) took her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) lips when, from some fancy or other, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) suddenly let it go. Why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should feel such a scruple, why he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind when it was all but done, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not perceive. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would have judged better, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought, if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had not stopped. The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it happened, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought nothing became him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) more. It was with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), of so simple, yet so dignified a nature. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) left them immediately afterwards gone in a moment. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) seemed more sudden than usual in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) disappearance.

<p/>Emma could not regret her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) having gone to Miss Bates, but she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had left her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ten minutes earlier; it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley. Neither would she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) regret that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) should be going to Brunswick Square, for she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knew how much his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) visit would be enjoyed but it might have happened at a better time and to have had longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter. They parted thorough friends, however; she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could not be deceived as to the meaning of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) countenance, and his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) unfinished gallantry; it was all done to assure her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had fully recovered his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) good opinion. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had been sitting with them half an hour, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) found. It was a pity that she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had not come back earlier!

<p/>In the hope of diverting her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) father's thoughts from the disagreeableness of Mr. Knightley's going to London; and going so suddenly; and going on horseback, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) knew would be all very bad; Emma communicated her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) news of Jane Fairfax, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) dependence on the effect was justified; it supplied a very useful check, interested, without disturbing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had long made up his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) mind to Jane Fairfax's going out as governess, and could talk of it cheerfully, but Mr. Knightley's going to London had been an unexpected blow.

<p/>"I am very glad, indeed, my dear, to hear she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) is to be so comfortably settled. Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her (<font color='blue'><b>Elton</b></font>) health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me. You know, my dear, she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us. And I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) will be better off in one respect, and not be induced to go away after it has been her (<font color='blue'><b>Taylor</b></font>) home so long."

<p/>The following day brought news from Richmond to throw every thing else into the background. An express arrived at Randalls to announce the death of Mrs. Churchill! Though her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew had had no particular reason to hasten back on her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) account, she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had not lived above six-and-thirty hours after his (<font color='blue'><b>nephew</b></font>) return. A sudden seizure of a different nature from any thing foreboded by her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) general state, had carried her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) off after a short struggle. The great Mrs. Churchill was no more.

<p/>It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) has nothing to do but to die; and when she (<font color='blue'><b>woman</b></font>) stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) was fully justified. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The event acquitted her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.

<p/>"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed and continual pain would try the temper. It was a sad event a great shock with all her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>)? Mr. Churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it." Even Mr. Weston shook his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) head, and looked solemn, and said, "Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) wife sat sighing and moralising over her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) husband her (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) saw in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his (<font color='blue'><b>Churchill</b></font>) nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her (<font color='blue'><b>wife</b></font>) goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.

<p/>Harriet behaved extremely well on the occasion, with great self-command. What ever she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might feel of brighter hope, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) betrayed nothing. Emma was gratified, to observe such a proof in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) of strengthened character, and refrained from any allusion that might endanger its maintenance. They spoke, therefore, of Mrs. Churchill's death with mutual forbearance.

<p/>Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.

<p/>It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) kindness and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had scarcely a stronger regret than for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) past coldness; and the person, whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wanted to be of use to her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>); wanted to shew a value for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) society, and testify respect and consideration. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) resolved to prevail on her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. <div class="bookquote">"Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Perry</b></font>)</div>and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own consent, by himself, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) doubt the possibility of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) health seemed for the moment completely deranged appetite quite gone and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>). He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) thought she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had undertaken more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was equal to, and that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) felt it so herself, though she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would not own it. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) spirits seemed overcome. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) present home, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder: confined always to one room; he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) could have wished it otherwise and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good aunt, though his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very old friend, he (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful. To take her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) be it only an hour or two from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) aunt, to give her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) change of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good; and the following morning she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could command, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) would call for her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name mentioning that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his (<font color='blue'><b>Perry</b></font>) patient. The answer was only in this short note:

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Miss Fairfax's compliments and thanks, but is quite unequal to any exercise."

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma felt that her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thought only of how she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the answer, therefore, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) but it would not do; Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service and every thing that message could do was tried but all in vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) worse. Emma wished she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could have seen her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and tried her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own powers; but, almost before she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) had promised her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in. <div class="bookquote">"Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body any body at all Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied and Mrs. Cole had made such a point and Mrs. Perry had said so much but, except them, Jane would really see nobody."

 (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div><p/>Emma did not want to be classed with the Mrs. Eltons, the Mrs. Perrys, and the Mrs. Coles, who would force themselves anywhere; neither could she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) feel any right of preference herself she (<font color='blue'><b>Coles</b></font>) submitted, therefore, and only questioned Miss Bates farther as to her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) niece's appetite and diet, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) longed to be able to assist. On that subject poor Miss Bates was very unhappy, and very communicative; Jane would hardly eat any thing: Mr. Perry recommended nourishing food; but every thing they could command (and never had any body such good neighbours) was distasteful.

<p/>Emma, on reaching home, called the housekeeper directly, to an examination of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) stores; and some arrowroot of very superior quality was speedily despatched to Miss Bates with a most friendly note. In half an hour the arrowroot was returned, with a thousand thanks from Miss Bates, but <div class="bookquote">"dear Jane would not be satisfied without its being sent back; it was a thing she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) could not take and, moreover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) insisted on her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) saying, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was not at all in want of any thing."

 (<font color='red'><b>Miss Bates</b></font>)</div><p/>When Emma afterwards heard that Jane Fairfax had been seen wandering about the meadows, at some distance from Highbury, on the afternoon of the very day on which she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) had, under the plea of being unequal to any exercise, so peremptorily refused to go out with her (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) in the carriage, she (<font color='blue'><b>Fairfax</b></font>) could have no doubt putting every thing together that Jane was resolved to receive no kindness from her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was sorry, very sorry. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) had the consolation of knowing that her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) even have seen into her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) heart, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.
