<p/>Till now that she was threatened with its loss, Emma had never known how much of her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) happiness depended on being first with Mr. Knightley, first in interest and affection. Satisfied that it was so, and feeling it her (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) due, she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) had enjoyed it without reflection; and only in the dread of being supplanted, found how inexpressibly important it had been. Long, very long, she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>she</b></font>) had been first; for, having no female connexions of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own, there had been only Isabella whose claims could be compared with hers, and she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had always known exactly how far he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) loved and esteemed Isabella. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had herself been first with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) for many years past. She (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had not deserved it; she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) had often been negligent or perverse, slighting his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) advice, or even wilfully opposing him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>), insensible of half his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) merits, and quarrelling with him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) because he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) would not acknowledge her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) false and insolent estimate of her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) own but still, from family attachment and habit, and thorough excellence of mind, he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) had loved her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and watched over her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) from a girl, with an endeavour to improve her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>), and an anxiety for her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) doing right, which no other creature had at all shared. In spite of all her (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) faults, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) knew she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) was dear to him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>); might she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) not say, very dear? When the suggestions of hope, however, which must follow here, presented themselves, she (<font color='blue'><b>Isabella</b></font>) could not presume to indulge them. Harriet Smith might think herself not unworthy of being peculiarly, exclusively, passionately loved by Mr. Knightley. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) could not flatter herself with any idea of blindness in his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) attachment to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>). She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had received a very recent proof of its impartiality. How shocked had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) been by her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) behaviour to Miss Bates! How directly, how strongly had he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) expressed himself to her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) on the subject! Not too strongly for the offence but far, far too strongly to issue from any feeling softer than upright justice and clear-sighted goodwill. She (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had no hope, nothing to deserve the name of hope, that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) could have that sort of affection for herself which was now in question; but there was a hope (at times a slight one, at times much stronger,) that Harriet might have deceived herself, and be overrating his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) regard for her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>). Wish it she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) must, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) sake be the consequence nothing to herself, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) remaining single all his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) life. Could she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) be secure of that, indeed, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) never marrying at all, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) believed she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should be perfectly satisfied. Let him (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) but continue the same Mr. Knightley to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) and her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) father, the same Mr. Knightley to all the world; let Donwell and Hartfield lose none of their precious intercourse of friendship and confidence, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) peace would be fully secured. Marriage, in fact, would not do for her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>). It would be incompatible with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) owed to her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father, and with what she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) felt for him (<font color='blue'><b>father</b></font>). Nothing should separate her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) from her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father. She (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) would not marry, even if she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) were asked by Mr. Knightley.

<p/>It must be her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) ardent wish that Harriet might be disappointed; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) hoped, that when able to see them together again, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) might at least be able to ascertain what the chances for it were. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) should see them henceforward with the closest observance; and wretchedly as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) had hitherto misunderstood even those she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was watching, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) did not know how to admit that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could be blinded here. He (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) was expected back every day. The power of observation would be soon given frightfully soon it appeared when her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) thoughts were in one course. In the meanwhile, she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) resolved against seeing Harriet. It would do neither of them good, it would do the subject no good, to be talking of it farther. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) was resolved not to be convinced, as long as she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) could doubt, and yet had no authority for opposing Harriet's confidence. To talk would be only to irritate. She (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) wrote to her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>), therefore, kindly, but decisively, to beg that she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) would not, at present, come to Hartfield; acknowledging it to be her (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) conviction, that all farther confidential discussion of one topic had better be avoided; and hoping, that if a few days were allowed to pass before they met again, except in the company of others she (<font color='blue'><b>Harriet</b></font>) objected only to a t te- -t te they might be able to act as if they had forgotten the conversation of yesterday. Harriet submitted, and approved, and was grateful.

<p/>This point was just arranged, when a visitor arrived to tear Emma's thoughts a little from the one subject which had engrossed them, sleeping or waking, the last twenty-four hours Mrs. Weston, who had been calling on her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) daughter-in-law elect, and took Hartfield in her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) way home, almost as much in duty to Emma as in pleasure to herself, to relate all the particulars of so interesting an interview.

<p/>Mr. Weston had accompanied her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to Mrs. Bates's, and gone through his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) share of this essential attention most handsomely; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) having then induced Miss Fairfax to join her (<font color='blue'><b>Bates</b></font>) in an airing, was now returned with much more to say, and much more to say with satisfaction, than a quarter of an hour spent in Mrs. Bates's parlour, with all the encumbrance of awkward feelings, could have afforded.

<p/>A little curiosity Emma had; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) made the most of it while her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) friend related. Mrs. Weston had set off to pay the visit in a good deal of agitation herself; and in the first place had wished not to go at all at present, to be allowed merely to write to Miss Fairfax instead, and to defer this ceremonious call till a little time had passed, and Mr. Churchill could be reconciled to the engagement's becoming known; as, considering every thing, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought such a visit could not be paid without leading to reports: but Mr. Weston had thought differently; he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was extremely anxious to shew his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) approbation to Miss Fairfax and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) family, and did not conceive that any suspicion could be excited by it; or if it were, that it would be of any consequence; for <div class="bookquote">"such things,"  (<font color='red'><b>family</b></font>)</div>he (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) observed, <div class="bookquote">"always got about."  (<font color='red'><b>he</b></font>)</div>Emma smiled, and felt that Mr. Weston had very good reason for saying so. They had gone, in short and very great had been the evident distress and confusion of the lady. She (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) had hardly been able to speak a word, and every look and action had shewn how deeply she (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) was suffering from consciousness. The quiet, heart-felt satisfaction of the old lady, and the rapturous delight of her (<font color='blue'><b>lady</b></font>) daughter who proved even too joyous to talk as usual, had been a gratifying, yet almost an affecting, scene. They were both so truly respectable in their happiness, so disinterested in every sensation; thought so much of Jane; so much of every body, and so little of themselves, that every kindly feeling was at work for them. Miss Fairfax's recent illness had offered a fair plea for Mrs. Weston to invite her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to an airing; she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had drawn back and declined at first, but, on being pressed had yielded; and, in the course of their drive, Mrs. Weston had, by gentle encouragement, overcome so much of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) embarrassment, as to bring her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to converse on the important subject. Apologies for her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) seemingly ungracious silence in their first reception, and the warmest expressions of the gratitude she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was always feeling towards herself and Mr. Weston, must necessarily open the cause; but when these effusions were put by, they had talked a good deal of the present and of the future state of the engagement. Mrs. Weston was convinced that such conversation must be the greatest relief to her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) companion, pent up within her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) own mind as every thing had so long been, and was very much pleased with all that she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had said on the subject.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"On the misery of what she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had suffered, during the concealment of so many months,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>continued Mrs. Weston, "she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was energetic. This was one of her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) expressions. <div class="bookquote">'I will not say, that since I entered into the engagement I have not had some happy moments; but I can say, that I have never known the blessing of one tranquil hour:'  (<font color='red'><b>the lip Emma</b></font>)</div>and the quivering lip, Emma, which uttered it, was an attestation that I felt at my heart."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor girl!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thinks herself wrong, then, for having consented to a private engagement?"

<p/>"Wrong! No one, I believe, can blame her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more than she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) is disposed to blame herself. <div class="bookquote">'The consequence,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), 'has been a state of perpetual suffering to me; and so it ought. But after all the punishment that misconduct can bring, it is still not less misconduct. Pain is no expiation. I never can be blameless. I have been acting contrary to all my sense of right; and the fortunate turn that every thing has taken, and the kindness I am now receiving, is what my conscience tells me ought not to be.' <div class="bookquote">'Do not imagine, madam,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>madam</b></font>) continued, 'that I was taught wrong. Do not let any reflection fall on the principles or the care of the friends who brought me up. The error has been all my own; and I do assure you that, with all the excuse that present circumstances may appear to give, I shall yet dread making the story known to Colonel Campbell.'"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Poor girl!"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma again. "She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) loves him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) then excessively, I suppose. It must have been from attachment only, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) could be led to form the engagement. Her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) affection must have overpowered her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) judgment."

<p/>"Yes, I have no doubt of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) being extremely attached to him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>)."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I am afraid,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>returned Emma, sighing, "that I must often have contributed to make her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unhappy."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"On your side, my love, it was very innocently done. But she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) probably had something of that in her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) thoughts, when alluding to the misunderstandings which he (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) had given us hints of before. One natural consequence of the evil she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) had involved herself in,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) said, "was that of making her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) unreasonable. The consciousness of having done amiss, had exposed her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to a thousand inquietudes, and made her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) captious and irritable to a degree that must have been that had been hard for him (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) to bear. <div class="bookquote">'I did not make the allowances,'  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), 'which I ought to have done, for his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) temper and spirits his (<font color='blue'><b>Campbell</b></font>) delightful spirits, and that gaiety, that playfulness of disposition, which, under any other circumstances, would, I am sure, have been as constantly bewitching to me, as they were at first.' She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) then began to speak of you, and of the great kindness you had shewn her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) during her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) illness; and with a blush which shewed me how it was all connected, desired me, whenever I had an opportunity, to thank you I could not thank you too much for every wish and every endeavour to do her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) good. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was sensible that you had never received any proper acknowledgment from herself."

<p/><div class="bookquote">"If I did not know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) to be happy now,"  (<font color='red'><b>Emma</b></font>)</div>said Emma, seriously, "which, in spite of every little drawback from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) scrupulous conscience, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) must be, I could not bear these thanks; for, oh! Mrs. Weston, if there were an account drawn up of the evil and the good I have done Miss Fairfax! Well (checking herself, and trying to be more lively), this is all to be forgotten. You are very kind to bring me these interesting particulars. They shew her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) to the greatest advantage. I am sure she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) is very good I hope she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) will be very happy. It is fit that the fortune should be on his (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) side, for I think the merit will be all on hers."

<p/>Such a conclusion could not pass unanswered by Mrs. Weston. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) thought well of Frank in almost every respect; and, what was more, she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) loved him (<font color='blue'><b>Frank</b></font>) very much, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) defence was, therefore, earnest. She (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) talked with a great deal of reason, and at least equal affection but she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) had too much to urge for Emma's attention; it was soon gone to Brunswick Square or to Donwell; she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) forgot to attempt to listen; and when Mrs. Weston ended with, <div class="bookquote">"We have not yet had the letter we are so anxious for, you know, but I hope it will soon come,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mrs. Weston</b></font>)</div>she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) was obliged to pause before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) answered, and at last obliged to answer at random, before she (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) could at all recollect what letter it was which they were so anxious for.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Are you well, my Emma?"  (<font color='red'><b>unknown</b></font>)</div>was Mrs. Weston's parting question.

<p/>"Oh! perfectly. I am always well, you know. Be sure to give me intelligence of the letter as soon as possible."

<p/>Mrs. Weston's communications furnished Emma with more food for unpleasant reflection, by increasing her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) esteem and compassion, and her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) sense of past injustice towards Miss Fairfax. She (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) bitterly regretted not having sought a closer acquaintance with her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>), and blushed for the envious feelings which had certainly been, in some measure, the cause. Had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) followed Mr. Knightley's known wishes, in paying that attention to Miss Fairfax, which was every way her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) due; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) tried to know her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) better; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) done her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) part towards intimacy; had she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) endeavoured to find a friend there instead of in Harriet Smith; she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must, in all probability, have been spared from every pain which pressed on her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) now. Birth, abilities, and education, had been equally marking one as an associate for her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>), to be received with gratitude; and the other what was she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>)? Supposing even that they had never become intimate friends; that she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had never been admitted into Miss Fairfax's confidence on this important matter which was most probable still, in knowing her (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) ought, and as she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) might, she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) must have been preserved from the abominable suspicions of an improper attachment to Mr. Dixon, which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) had not only so foolishly fashioned and harboured herself, but had so unpardonably imparted; an idea which she (<font color='blue'><b>Smith</b></font>) greatly feared had been made a subject of material distress to the delicacy of Jane's feelings, by the levity or carelessness of Frank Churchill's. Of all the sources of evil surrounding the former, since her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) coming to Highbury, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) was persuaded that she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must herself have been the worst. She (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) must have been a perpetual enemy. They never could have been all three together, without her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) having stabbed Jane Fairfax's peace in a thousand instances; and on Box Hill, perhaps, it had been the agony of a mind that would bear no more.

<p/>The evening of this day was very long, and melancholy, at Hartfield. The weather added what it could of gloom. A cold stormy rain set in, and nothing of July appeared but in the trees and shrubs, which the wind was despoiling, and the length of the day, which only made such cruel sights the longer visible.

<p/>The weather affected Mr. Woodhouse, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) could only be kept tolerably comfortable by almost ceaseless attention on his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) daughter's side, and by exertions which had never cost her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) half so much before. It reminded her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) of their first forlorn t te- -t te, on the evening of Mrs. Weston's wedding-day; but Mr. Knightley had walked in then, soon after tea, and dissipated every melancholy fancy. Alas! such delightful proofs of Hartfield's attraction, as those sort of visits conveyed, might shortly be over. The picture which she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) had then drawn of the privations of the approaching winter, had proved erroneous; no friends had deserted them, no pleasures had been lost. But her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) present forebodings she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) feared would experience no similar contradiction. The prospect before her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) now, was threatening to a degree that could not be entirely dispelled that might not be even partially brightened. If all took place that might take place among the circle of her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) friends, Hartfield must be comparatively deserted; and she (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) left to cheer her (<font color='blue'><b>Hartfield</b></font>) father with the spirits only of ruined happiness.

<p/>The child to be born at Randalls must be a tie there even dearer than herself; and Mrs. Weston's heart and time would be occupied by it. They should lose her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>); and, probably, in great measure, her (<font color='blue'><b>Weston</b></font>) husband also. Frank Churchill would return among them no more; and Miss Fairfax, it was reasonable to suppose, would soon cease to belong to Highbury. They would be married, and settled either at or near Enscombe. All that were good would be withdrawn; and if to these losses, the loss of Donwell were to be added, what would remain of cheerful or of rational society within their reach? Mr. Knightley to be no longer coming there for his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) evening comfort! No longer walking in at all hours, as if ever willing to change his (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) own home for their's! How was it to be endured? And if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be lost to them for Harriet's sake; if he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) were to be thought of hereafter, as finding in Harriet's society all that he (<font color='blue'><b>Knightley</b></font>) wanted; if Harriet were to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he (<font color='blue'><b>friend</b></font>) looked for all the best blessings of existence; what could be increasing Emma's wretchedness but the reflection never far distant from her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) mind, that it had been all her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own work?

<p/>When it came to such a pitch as this, she (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) was not able to refrain from a start, or a heavy sigh, or even from walking about the room for a few seconds and the only source whence any thing like consolation or composure could be drawn, was in the resolution of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) own better conduct, and the hope that, however inferior in spirit and gaiety might be the following and every future winter of her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) life to the past, it would yet find her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) more rational, more acquainted with herself, and leave her (<font color='blue'><b>Emma</b></font>) less to regret when it were gone.
