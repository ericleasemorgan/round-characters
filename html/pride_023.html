<p/>Elizabeth was sitting with her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother and sisters, reflecting on
what she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) had heard, and doubting whether she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was authorised to
mention it, when Sir William Lucas himself appeared, sent by his (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
daughter, to announce her (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) engagement to the family. With many
compliments to them, and much self-gratulation on the prospect of
a connection between the houses, he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) unfolded the matter—to an
audience not merely wondering, but incredulous; for Mrs. Bennet,
with more perseverance than politeness, protested he (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) must be
entirely mistaken; and Lydia, always unguarded and often uncivil,
boisterously exclaimed:

<p/>"Good Lord! Sir William, how can you tell such a story? Do not
you know that Mr. Collins wants to marry Lizzy?"

<p/>Nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne
without anger such treatment; but Sir William’s good breeding
carried him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) through it all; and though he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) begged leave to be
positive as to the truth of his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) information, he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) listened to all
their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy.

<p/>Elizabeth, feeling it incumbent on her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to relieve him (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) from so
unpleasant a situation, now put herself forward to confirm his (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>)
account, by mentioning her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) prior knowledge of it from Charlotte
herself; and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
mother and sisters by the earnestness of her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) congratulations to
Sir William, in which she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was readily joined by Jane, and by
making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be
expected from the match, the excellent character of Mr. Collins,
and the convenient distance of Hunsford from London.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal
while Sir William remained; but no sooner had he (<font color='blue'><b>William</b></font>) left them than
her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) feelings found a rapid vent. In the first place, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter; secondly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
was very sure that Mr. Collins had been taken in; thirdly, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
trusted that they would never be happy together; and fourthly,
that the match might be broken off. Two inferences, however, were
plainly deduced from the whole: one, that Elizabeth was the real
cause of the mischief; and the other that she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) herself had been
barbarously misused by them all; and on these two points she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
principally dwelt during the rest of the day. Nothing could
console and nothing could appease her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>). Nor did that day wear out
her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) resentment. A week elapsed before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could see Elizabeth
without scolding her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>), a month passed away before she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) could speak
to Sir William or Lady Lucas without being rude, and many months
were gone before she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) could at all forgive their daughter.

<p/>Mr. Bennet’s emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion,
and such as he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) did experience he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) pronounced to be of a most
agreeable sort; for it gratified him (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>), he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) said, to discover that
Charlotte Lucas, whom he (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) had been used to think tolerably
sensible, was as foolish as his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) wife, and more foolish than his (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>)
daughter!

<p/>Jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match; but she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
said less of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) astonishment than of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) earnest desire for
their happiness; nor could Elizabeth persuade her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) to consider it
as improbable. Kitty and Lydia were far from envying Miss Lucas,
for Mr. Collins was only a clergyman; and it affected them in no
other way than as a piece of news to spread at Meryton.

<p/>Lady Lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to
retort on Mrs. Bennet the comfort of having a daughter well
married; and she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) called at Longbourn rather oftener than usual to
say how happy she (<font color='blue'><b>daughter</b></font>) was, though Mrs. Bennet’s sour looks and
ill-natured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness
away.

<p/>Between Elizabeth and Charlotte there was a restraint which kept
them mutually silent on the subject; and Elizabeth felt persuaded
that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again.
Her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) disappointment in Charlotte made her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) turn with fonder regard
to her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) sister, of whose rectitude and delicacy she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was sure her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>)
opinion could never be shaken, and for whose happiness she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) grew
daily more anxious, as Bingley had now been gone a week and
nothing more was heard of his (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) return.

<p/>Jane had sent Caroline an early answer to her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) letter, and was
counting the days till she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) might reasonably hope to hear again.
The promised letter of thanks from Mr. Collins arrived on
Tuesday, addressed to their father, and written with all the
solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonth’s abode in the family
might have prompted. After discharging his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) conscience on that
head, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) proceeded to inform them, with many rapturous
expressions, of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) happiness in having obtained the affection of
their amiable neighbour, Miss Lucas, and then explained that it
was merely with the view of enjoying her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) society that he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) had been
so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) again at
Longbourn, whither he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) hoped to be able to return on Monday
fortnight; for Lady Catherine, he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) added, so heartily approved his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
marriage, that she (<font color='blue'><b>Lady</b></font>) wished it to take place as soon as possible,
which he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
amiable Charlotte to name an early day for making him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) the
happiest of men.

<p/>Mr. Collins’s return into Hertfordshire was no longer a matter of
pleasure to Mrs. Bennet. On the contrary, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was as much
disposed to complain of it as her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) husband. It was very strange
that he (<font color='blue'><b>husband</b></font>) should come to Longbourn instead of to Lucas Lodge; it
was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome. She (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) hated
having visitors in the house while her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) health was so indifferent,
and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable. Such were
the gentle murmurs of Mrs. Bennet, and they gave way only to the
greater distress of Mr. Bingley’s continued absence.

<p/>Neither Jane nor Elizabeth were comfortable on this subject. Day
after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>)
than the report which shortly prevailed in Meryton of his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) coming
no more to Netherfield the whole winter; a report which highly
incensed Mrs. Bennet, and which she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) never failed to contradict as
a most scandalous falsehood.

<p/>Even Elizabeth began to fear—not that Bingley was indifferent—but
that his (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) sisters would be successful in keeping him (<font color='blue'><b>Mr.</b></font>) away.
Unwilling as she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was to admit an idea so destructive of Jane’s
happiness, and so dishonorable to the stability of her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) lover, she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)
could not prevent its frequently occurring. The united efforts of
his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) two unfeeling sisters and of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) overpowering friend,
assisted by the attractions of Miss Darcy and the amusements of
London might be too much, she (<font color='blue'><b>Darcy</b></font>) feared, for the strength of his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
attachment.

<p/>As for Jane, _her (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>)_ anxiety under this suspense was, of course,
more painful than Elizabeth’s, but whatever she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) felt she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) was
desirous of concealing, and between herself and Elizabeth,
therefore, the subject was never alluded to. But as no such
delicacy restrained her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) mother, an hour seldom passed in which
she (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) did not talk of Bingley, express her (<font color='blue'><b>Elizabeth</b></font>) impatience for his (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>)
arrival, or even require Jane to confess that if he (<font color='blue'><b>lover</b></font>) did not come
back she (<font color='blue'><b>Jane</b></font>) would think herself very ill used. It needed all Jane’s
steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable
tranquillity.

<p/>Mr. Collins returned most punctually on Monday fortnight, but his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)
reception at Longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been
on his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) first introduction. He (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) was too happy, however, to need
much attention; and luckily for the others, the business of
love-making relieved them from a great deal of his (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) company. The
chief of every day was spent by him (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>) at Lucas Lodge, and he (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>)
sometimes returned to Longbourn only in time to make an apology
for his (<font color='blue'><b>Lodge</b></font>) absence before the family went to bed.

<p/>Mrs. Bennet was really in a most pitiable state. The very mention
of anything concerning the match threw her (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) into an agony of
ill-humour, and wherever she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) went she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) was sure of hearing it
talked of. The sight of Miss Lucas was odious to her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>). As her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)
successor in that house, she (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) regarded her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) with jealous
abhorrence. Whenever Charlotte came to see them, she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) concluded
her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) to be anticipating the hour of possession; and whenever she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>)
spoke in a low voice to Mr. Collins, was convinced that they were
talking of the Longbourn estate, and resolving to turn herself
and her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) daughters out of the house, as soon as Mr. Bennet were
dead. She (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) complained bitterly of all this to her (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>) husband.

<p/><div class="bookquote">"Indeed, Mr. Bennet,"  (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div>said she (<font color='blue'><b>Charlotte</b></font>), <div class="bookquote">"it is very hard to think that
Charlotte Lucas should ever be mistress of this house, that _I_
should be forced to make way for _her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>)_, and live to see her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) take
her (<font color='blue'><b>Lucas</b></font>) place in it!"

 (<font color='red'><b>she</b></font>)</div><p/>"My dear, do not give way to such gloomy thoughts. Let us hope
for better things. Let us flatter ourselves that _I_ may be the
survivor.<div class="bookquote">"

<p/>This was not very consoling to Mrs. Bennet, and therefore,
instead of making any answer, she (<font color='blue'><b>Bennet</b></font>) went on as before.

<p/>" (<font color='red'><b>I</b></font>)</div>I cannot bear to think that they should have all this estate. If
it was not for the entail, I should not mind it."

<p/>"What should not you mind?"

<p/>"I should not mind anything at all."

<p/>"Let us be thankful that you are preserved from a state of such
insensibility."

<p/>"I never can be thankful, Mr. Bennet, for anything about the
entail. How anyone could have the conscience to entail away an
estate from one’s own daughters, I cannot understand; and all for
the sake of Mr. Collins too! Why should _he (<font color='blue'><b>Collins</b></font>)_ have it more than
anybody else?"

<p/><div class="bookquote">"I leave it to yourself to determine,"  (<font color='red'><b>Mr. Bennet</b></font>)</div>said Mr. Bennet.
