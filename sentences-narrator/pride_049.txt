49 Two days after Mr. Bennet ’s return, as Jane and Elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house, they saw the housekeeper coming towards them, and, concluding that she came to call them to their mother, went forward to meet her; but, instead of the expected summons, when they approached her, she said to Miss Bennet, I beg your pardon, madam, for interrupting you, but I was in hopes you might have got some good news from town, so I took the liberty of coming to ask.
No, said her father; Wickham ’s a fool if he takes her with a farthing less than ten thousand pounds.
Jane, who was not so light nor so much in the habit of running as Elizabeth, soon lagged behind, while her sister, panting for breath, came up with him, and eagerly cried out : Oh, papa, what news — what news ?
Can it be possible that he will marry her ?
Wickham is not so undeserving, then, as we thought him, said her sister.
Elizabeth took the letter from his writing - table, and they went up stairs together.
cried Elizabeth.
Most earnestly did she then entreat him to lose no more time before he wrote.
Elizabeth impatiently caught it from his hand.
my dear father, she cried, come back and write immediately.
cried Elizabeth, as soon as they were by themselves.
And may I ask — said Elizabeth; but the terms, I suppose, must be complied with.
Elizabeth read on : I have seen them both.
Elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest, and then, sick of this folly, took refuge in her own room, that she might think with freedom.
