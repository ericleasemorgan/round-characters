Their intended excursion to Whitwell turned out very different from what Elinor had expected.
She was prepared to be wet through, fatigued, and frightened; but the event was still more unfortunate, for they did not go at all.
Could Elinor have listened to her without interruption from the others, she would have described every room in the house with equal delight.
Mrs. Jennings sat on Elinor ’s right hand; and they had not been long seated, before she leant behind her and Willoughby, and said to Marianne, loud enough for them both to hear, I have found you out in spite of all your tricks.
Elinor then heard Willoughby say, in a low voice to Marianne, There are some people who can not bear a party of pleasure.
