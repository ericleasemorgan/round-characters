When the engagement was for home, some of the officers always made part of it — of which officers Mr. Wickham was sure to be one; and on these occasions, Mrs. Gardiner, rendered suspicious by Elizabeth ’s warm commendation, narrowly observed them both.
Without supposing them, from what she saw, to be very seriously in love, their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy; and she resolved to speak to Elizabeth on the subject before she left Hertfordshire, and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment.
Elizabeth was exceedingly pleased with this proposal, and felt persuaded of her sister ’s ready acquiescence.
Mrs. Gardiner, to whom the chief of this news had been given before, in the course of Jane and Elizabeth ’s correspondence with her, made her sister a slight answer, and, in compassion to her nieces, turned the conversation.
When alone with Elizabeth afterwards, she spoke more on the subject.
But in spite of the certainty in which Elizabeth affected to place this point, as well as the still more interesting one of Bingley ’s being withheld from seeing Jane, she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her, on examination, that she did not consider it entirely hopeless.
