The room had then become useless, and for some time was quite deserted, except by Fanny, when she visited her plants, or wanted one of the books, which she was still glad to keep there, from the deficiency of space and accommodation in her little chamber above : but gradually, as her value for the comforts of it increased, she had added to her possessions, and spent more of her time there; and having nothing to oppose her, had so naturally and so artlessly worked herself into it, that it was now generally admitted to be hers.

Her conscience stopt her in the middle, but Edmund was satisfied.
And now, dear Fanny, I will not interrupt you any longer.
Does it not strike you so, Fanny ?
