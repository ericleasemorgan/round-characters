Busy as he was, however, the young man was yet able to shew a most happy countenance on seeing Emma again.
I have now a key to all her odd looks and ways.
Leave shame to her.
If she does wrong, she ought to feel it.
She is not entirely without it, I think.
She is playing Robin Adair at this moment his favourite.
That she was not immediately ready, Emma did suspect to arise from the state of her nerves; she had not yet possessed the instrument long enough to touch it without emotion; she must reason herself into the power of performance; and Emma could not but pity such feelings, whatever their origin, and could not but resolve never to expose them to her neighbour again.
He took some music from a chair near the pianoforte, and turning to Emma, said, Here is something quite new to me.
Mrs. Weston had been delighted before, and was delighted again; Emma joined her in all her praise; and the pianoforte, with every proper discrimination, was pronounced to be altogether of the highest promise.
Do not distress her.
I would have her understand me.
The listeners were amused; and Mrs. Weston gave Emma a look of particular meaning.
Emma took the opportunity of whispering, You speak too plain.
She must understand you.
I hope she does.
Emma found it really time to be at home; the visit had already lasted long; and on examining watches, so much of the morning was perceived to be gone, that Mrs. Weston and her companion taking leave also, could allow themselves only to walk with the two young ladies to Hartfield gates, before they set off for Randalls.
But Emma still shook her head in steady scepticism.
