When coffee was over, Colonel Fitzwilliam reminded Elizabeth of having promised to play to him; and she sat down directly to the instrument.
He drew a chair near her.
Elizabeth saw what he was doing, and at the first convenient pause, turned to him with an arch smile, and said : You mean to frighten me, Mr. Darcy, by coming in all this state to hear me ?
He now seated himself by her, and talked so agreeably of Kent and Hertfordshire, of travelling and staying at home, of new books and music, that Elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before; and they conversed with so much spirit and flow, as to draw the attention of Lady Catherine herself, as well as of Mr. Darcy.
Elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself, and said to Colonel Fitzwilliam, Your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me, and teach you not to believe a word I say.
Elizabeth immediately began playing again.
Elizabeth looked at Darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousin ’s praise; but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love; and from the whole of his behaviour to Miss de Bourgh she derived this comfort for Miss Bingley, that he might have been just as likely to marry _ her _, had she been his relation.
Lady Catherine continued her remarks on Elizabeth ’s performance, mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste.
Elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility, and, at the request of the gentlemen, remained at the instrument till her ladyship ’s carriage was ready to take them all home.
said Elizabeth, still addressing Colonel Fitzwilliam.
