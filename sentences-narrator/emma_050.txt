XIV What totally different feelings did Emma take back into the house from what she had brought out !
— she had then been only daring to hope for a little respite of suffering; — she was now in an exquisite flutter of happiness, and such happiness moreover as she believed must still be greater when the flutter should have passed away.
— and how often had her eyes fallen on the same shrubs in the lawn, and observed the same beautiful effect of the western sun !
— But never in such a state of spirits, never in any thing like it; and it was with difficulty that she could summon enough of her usual self to be the attentive lady of the house, or even the attentive daughter.
As long as Mr. Knightley remained with them, Emma's fever continued; but when he was gone, she began to be a little tranquillised and subdued — and in the course of the sleepless night, which was the tax for such an evening, she found one or two such very serious points to consider, as made her feel, that even her happiness must have some alloy.
Her father — and Harriet.
While you considered me as having sinned against Emma Woodhouse, I could deserve nothing from either.

I have the greatest pleasure, my dear Emma, in forwarding to you the enclosed.
