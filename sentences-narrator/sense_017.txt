She knows her own worth too well for false shame, replied Edward.
Elinor laughed.
Indeed a man could not very well be in love with either of her daughters, without extending the passion to her; and Elinor had the satisfaction of seeing him soon become more like himself.
Elinor smiled again, to hear her sister describing so accurately their future expenses at Combe Magna.
She is only grown a little more grave than she was.
Elinor looked surprised at his emotion; but trying to laugh off the subject, she said to him, Do not you know my sister well enough to understand what she means ?
I believe you are right, he replied, and yet I have always set her down as a lively girl.
We are all unanimous in that wish, I suppose, said Elinor, in spite of the insufficiency of wealth.
