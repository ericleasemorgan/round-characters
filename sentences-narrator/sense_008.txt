Soon after this, upon Elinor ’s leaving the room, Mama, said Marianne, I have an alarm on the subject of illness which I can not conceal from you.
Does Elinor expect him already ?
I have never mentioned it to her, but of course she must.
said Elinor, do you call Colonel Brandon infirm ?
I rather think you are mistaken, for when I was talking to her yesterday of getting a new grate for the spare bedchamber, she observed that there was no immediate hurry for it, as it was not likely that the room would be wanted for some time.
In Edward ’s farewell there was no distinction between Elinor and me : it was the good wishes of an affectionate brother to both.
And Elinor, in quitting Norland and Edward, cried not as I did.
Even now her self - command is invariable.
When is she dejected or melancholy ?
When does she try to avoid society, or appear restless and dissatisfied in it ?
