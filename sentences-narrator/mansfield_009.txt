Mr. Crawford was soon followed by Miss Bertram and Mr. Rushworth; and when, after a little time, the others began to form into parties, these three were found in busy consultation on the terrace by Edmund, Miss Crawford, and Fanny, who seemed as naturally to unite, and who, after a short participation of their regrets and difficulties, left them and walked on.
Fanny said she was rested, and would have moved too, but this was not suffered.
Edmund urged her remaining where she was with an earnestness which she could not resist, and she was left on the bench to think with pleasure of her cousin â€™s care, but with great regret that she was not stronger.
She watched them till they had turned the corner, and listened till all sound of them had ceased.
