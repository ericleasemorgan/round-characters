And now, Elinor, what have you to say ?
My Elinor, is it possible to doubt their engagement ?
Oh, Elinor, how incomprehensible are your feelings !
Elinor ’s uneasiness was at least equal to her mother ’s.
She thought of what had just passed with anxiety and distrust.
Willoughby ’s behaviour in taking leave of them, his embarrassment, and affectation of cheerfulness, and, above all, his unwillingness to accept her mother ’s invitation, a backwardness so unlike a lover, so unlike himself, greatly disturbed her.
One moment she feared that no serious design had ever been formed on his side; and the next that some unfortunate quarrel had taken place between him and her sister; — the distress in which Marianne had quitted the room was such as a serious quarrel could most reasonably account for, though when she considered what Marianne ’s love for him was, a quarrel seemed almost impossible.
They were interrupted by the entrance of Margaret; and Elinor was then at liberty to think over the representations of her mother, to acknowledge the probability of many, and hope for the justice of all.
It was not inclination that he wanted, Elinor; I could plainly see _ that _.
Elinor felt equal amazement.
I have explained it to myself in the most satisfactory way; — but you, Elinor, who love to doubt where you can — it will not satisfy _ you _, I know; but you shall not talk _ me _ out of my trust in it.
