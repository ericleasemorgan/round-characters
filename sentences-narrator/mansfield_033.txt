It was with reluctance that he suffered her to go; but there was no look of despair in parting to belie his words, or give her hopes of his being less unreasonable than he professed himself.
Now she was angry.
Here was again a want of delicacy and regard for others which had formerly so struck and disgusted her.
Here was again a something of the same Mr. Crawford whom she had so reprobated before.
Had her own affections been as free — as perhaps they ought to have been — he never could have engaged them.
The promised departure was all that Fanny could think of with much satisfaction.
Her uncle ’s kind expressions, however, and forbearing manner, were sensibly felt; and when she considered how much of the truth was unknown to him, she believed she had no right to wonder at the line of conduct he pursued.
And you must be aware, Fanny, that it is every young woman ’s duty to accept such a very unexceptionable offer as this.
Mr. Crawford ’s steadiness was honoured, and Fanny was praised, and the connexion was still the most desirable in the world.
And still pursuing the same cheerful thoughts, she soon afterwards added, And I will tell you what, Fanny, which is more than I did for Maria : the next time Pug has a litter you shall have a puppy.
By convincing her that Fanny _ was _ very pretty, which she had been doubting about before, and that she would be advantageously married, it made her feel a sort of credit in calling her niece.
The effect of the whole was a manner so pitying and agitated, and words intermingled with her refusal so expressive of obligation and concern, that to a temper of vanity and hope like Crawford ’s, the truth, or at least the strength of her indifference, might well be questionable; and he was not so irrational as Fanny considered him, in the professions of persevering, assiduous, and not desponding attachment which closed the interview.
