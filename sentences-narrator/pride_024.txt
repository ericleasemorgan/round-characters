Elizabeth, to whom Jane very soon communicated the chief of all this, heard it in silent indignation.
The whole of what Elizabeth had already heard, his claims on Mr. Darcy, and all that he had suffered from him, was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed; and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked Mr. Darcy before they had known anything of the matter.
A day or two passed before Jane had courage to speak of her feelings to Elizabeth; but at last, on Mrs. Bennet ’s leaving them together, after a longer irritation than usual about Netherfield and its master, she could not help saying : Oh, that my dear mother had more command over herself !
Elizabeth looked at her sister with incredulous solicitude, but said nothing.
Elizabeth could not oppose such a wish; and from this time Mr. Bingley ’s name was scarcely ever mentioned between them.
Mrs. Bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more, and though a day seldom passed in which Elizabeth did not account for it clearly, there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity.
Her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself, that his attentions to Jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking, which ceased when he saw her no more; but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time, she had the same story to repeat every day.
exclaimed Elizabeth, you are too good.
Nay, said Elizabeth, this is not fair.
