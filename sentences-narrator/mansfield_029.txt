After seeing William to the last moment, Fanny walked back to the breakfast - room with a very saddened heart to grieve over the melancholy change; and there her uncle kindly left her to cry in peace, conceiving, perhaps, that the deserted chair of each young man might exercise her tender enthusiasm, and that the remaining cold pork bones and mustard in William ’s plate might but divide her feelings with the broken egg - shells in Mr. Crawford ’s.
She sat and cried _ con _ _ amore _ as her uncle intended, but it was _ con _ _ amore _ fraternal and no other.
William was gone, and she now felt as if she had wasted half his visit in idle cares and selfish solicitudes unconnected with him.
The first half - hour was lost, for Fanny and Lady Bertram were together, and unless she had Fanny to herself she could hope for nothing.
The cards were brought, and Fanny played at cribbage with her aunt till bedtime; and as Sir Thomas was reading to himself, no sounds were heard in the room for the next two hours beyond the reckonings of the game — And _ that _ makes thirty - one; four in hand and eight in crib.
Her companion looked at her keenly; and gathering greater spirit from the blush soon produced from such a look, only said, He is best off as he is, and turned the subject.
