27 The next morning brought the following very unexpected letter from Isabella : _ Bath, April _ My dearest Catherine, I received your two kind letters with the greatest delight, and have a thousand apologies to make for not answering them sooner.
Its inconsistencies, contradictions, and falsehood struck her from the very first.
Such a strain of shallow artifice could not impose even upon Catherine.
Her professions of attachment were now as disgusting as her excuses were empty, and her demands impudent.
She was ashamed of Isabella, and ashamed of having ever loved her.
Write to James on her behalf !
She resolved on not answering Isabella â€™s letter, and tried to think no more of it.
Lose no time, my dearest, sweetest Catherine, in writing to him and to me, Who ever am, etc.
Catherine was complimented out of further bitterness.
