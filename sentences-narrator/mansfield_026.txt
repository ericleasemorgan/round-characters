It was just the plan to suit Fanny; and with a great deal of gratitude on her side for such ready and kind attention, they proceeded indoors, and upstairs, and were soon deep in the interesting subject.
Fanny acknowledged her wishes and doubts on this point : she did not know how either to wear the cross, or to refrain from wearing it.
She was answered by having a small trinket - box placed before her, and being requested to chuse from among several gold chains and necklaces.
Such had been the parcel with which Miss Crawford was provided, and such the object of her intended visit : and in the kindest manner she now urged Fanny â€™s taking one for the cross and to keep for her sake, saying everything she could think of to obviate the scruples which were making Fanny start back at first with a look of horror at the proposal.
It was of gold, prettily worked; and though Fanny would have preferred a longer and a plainer chain as more adapted for her purpose, she hoped, in fixing on this, to be chusing what Miss Crawford least wished to keep.
