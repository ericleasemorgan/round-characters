I Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma ’s opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day.
She could not think that Harriet ’s solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned; — but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive — Mr. Elton is so good to the poor !
she found something else must be done.
Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies ’ ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet ’s being obliged to say a word.
And Emma had the advantage of hearing her own silly compliment repeated twice over before the good old lady could comprehend it.
