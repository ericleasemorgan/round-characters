Mrs. Weston was afraid of draughts for the young people in that passage; and neither Emma nor the gentlemen could tolerate the prospect of being miserably crowded at supper.
Poor little Emma !
Had she intended ever to marry him, it might have been worth while to pause and consider, and try to understand the value of his preference, and the character of his temper; but for all the purposes of their acquaintance, he was quite amiable enough.
Emma demurred.
Emma was most happy to be called to such a council; and her father, engaging to think it all over while she was gone, the two young people set off together without delay for the Crown.
interrupted Emma, there will be plenty of time for talking every thing over.
My dear, you are too particular, said her husband.
Emma said it would be awkward; Mrs. Weston was in distress about the supper; and Mr. Woodhouse opposed it earnestly, on the score of health.
The party did not break up without Emma's being positively secured for the two first dances by the hero of the evening, nor without her overhearing Mr. Weston whisper to his wife, He has asked her, my dear.
She will be all delight and gratitude, but she will tell you nothing.
Emma perceived that the nature of his gallantry was a little self - willed, and that he would rather oppose than lose the pleasure of dancing with her; but she took the compliment, and forgave the rest.
I could not bear it for Emma !
Emma is not strong.
She would catch a dreadful cold.
She will not even listen to your questions.
