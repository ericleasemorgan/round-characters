I should have thought, said Anne, that my manner to yourself might have spared you much or all of this.
Anne felt that she did not belong to the conversation, and yet, as Captain Harville seemed thoughtful and not disposed to talk, she could not avoid hearing many undesirable particulars; such as, how Mr Musgrove and my brother Hayter had met again and again to talk it over; what my brother Hayter had said one day, and what Mr Musgrove had proposed the next, and what had occurred to my sister Hayter, and what the young people had wished, and what I said at first I never could consent to, but was afterwards persuaded to think might do very well, and a great deal in the same style of open - hearted communication : minutiae which, even with every advantage of taste and delicacy, which good Mrs Musgrove could not give, could be properly interesting only to the principals.
I am going home, and you have an engagement with your friend.
There is no hurry on my side.
I am in very good anchorage here, ( smiling at Anne, ) well supplied, and want for nothing.
