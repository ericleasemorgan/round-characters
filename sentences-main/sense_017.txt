Marianne has not shyness to excuse any inattention of hers, said Elinor.
Marianne is as steadfast as ever, you see, said Elinor, she is not at all altered.
Nor do I think it a part of Marianne ’s, said Elinor; I should hardly call her a lively girl — she is very earnest, very eager in all she does — sometimes talks a great deal and always with animation — but she is not often really merry.
I have frequently detected myself in such kind of mistakes, said Elinor, in a total misapprehension of character in some point or other : fancying people so much more gay or grave, or ingenious or stupid than they really are, and I can hardly tell why or in what the deception originated.
You must begin your improvements on this house, observed Elinor, and your difficulties will soon vanish.
Grandeur has but little, said Elinor, but wealth has much to do with it.
Quite the contrary, replied Elinor, looking expressively at Marianne.
Perhaps, said Elinor, smiling, we may come to the same point.
