But I ought to have looked about me more, said Anne, conscious while she spoke that there had in fact been no want of looking about, that the object only had been deficient.
Indeed, my dear Mrs Smith, I want none, cried Anne.
No, said Anne, I can readily believe all that of my cousin.
Perhaps, cried Anne, struck by a sudden idea, you sometimes spoke of me to Mr Elliot ?
I am very glad to know all this, said Anne, after a little thoughtfulness.
This must have been about that very period of Mr Elliot's life, said Anne, which has always excited my particular curiosity.
Nay, said Anne, I have no particular enquiry to make about her.
Yes, said Anne, you tell me nothing which does not accord with what I have known, or could imagine.
The whole history, repeated Anne, laughing.
