I must hurry away then, to give him those thanks which you will not allow me to give _ you; _ to assure him that he has made me a very — an exceedingly happy man.
When I see him again, said Elinor to herself, as the door shut him out, I shall see him the husband of Lucy.
Thank you, ma’am, said Elinor.
You would not have gone, however, said Elinor, recovering herself, and determined to get over what she so much dreaded as soon as possible, without receiving our good wishes, even if we had not been able to give them in person.
Well, my dear, she cried, I sent you up the young man.
Really, said Elinor, I know so little of these kind of forms, that I can hardly even conjecture as to the time, or the preparation necessary; but I suppose two or three months will complete his ordination.
You mean to go to Delaford after them I suppose, said Elinor, with a faint smile.
My dear ma’am, said Elinor, what can you be thinking of ?
Certainly, ma’am, replied Elinor, not hearing much of what she said, and more anxious to be alone, than to be mistress of the subject.
Indeed, replied Elinor, I believe that you will find him, on farther acquaintance, all that you have heard him to be, and as you will be such very near neighbours ( for I understand the parsonage is almost close to the mansion - house, ) it is particularly important that he _ should _ be all this.
