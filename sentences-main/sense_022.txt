Her astonishment at what she heard was at first too great for words; but at length forcing herself to speak, and to speak cautiously, she said, with calmness of manner, which tolerably well concealed her surprise and solicitude — May I ask if your engagement is of long standing ?
Yes.
I did not know, said she, that you were even acquainted till the other day.
You are quite in the right, replied Elinor calmly.
I think I have, replied Elinor, with an exertion of spirits, which increased with her increase of emotion.
I am sorry I do _ not _, said Elinor, in great astonishment, if it could be of any use to YOU to know my opinion of her.
I certainly did not seek your confidence, said Elinor; but you do me no more than justice in imagining that I may be depended on.
Certainly, answered Elinor, without knowing what she said; but after a moment ’s reflection, she added, with revived security of Edward ’s honour and love, and her companion ’s falsehood — Engaged to Mr. Edward Ferrars !
It is strange, replied Elinor, in a most painful perplexity, that I should never have heard him even mention your name.
I did, said Elinor, with a composure of voice, under which was concealed an emotion and distress beyond any thing she had ever felt before.
Four years you have been engaged, said she with a firm voice.
