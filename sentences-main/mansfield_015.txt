Edmund was too angry to speak; but Miss Crawford, looking for a moment with astonished eyes at Mrs. Norris, and then at Fanny, whose tears were beginning to shew themselves, immediately said, with some keenness, I do not like my situation : this _ place _ is too hot for me, and moved away her chair to the opposite side of the table, close to Fanny, saying to her, in a kind, low whisper, as she placed herself, Never mind, my dear Miss Price, this is a cross evening : everybody is cross and teasing, but do not let us mind them; and with pointed attention continued to talk to her and endeavour to raise her spirits, in spite of being out of spirits herself.
