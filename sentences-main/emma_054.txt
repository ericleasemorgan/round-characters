I can never think of it, she cried, without extreme shame.
I have always admired her complexion, replied Emma, archly; but do not I remember the time when you found fault with her for being so pale ?
Good or bad ?
You mistake me, you quite mistake me, she replied, exerting herself.
I am perfectly satisfied, replied Emma, with the brightest smiles, and most sincerely wish them happy.
It is not now worth a regret, said Emma.
No, indeed, cried Emma, most happy to begin, not in the least.
He thanked her with all his heart, and continued some time to speak with serious feeling of his gratitude and happiness.
Very beautiful, indeed, replied Emma; and she spoke so kindly, that he gratefully burst out, How delighted I am to see you again !
She was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.
