I have not a doubt of Mr. Bingley ’s sincerity, said Elizabeth warmly; but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only.
His guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same, said Elizabeth angrily; for I have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of Mr. Darcy ’s steward, and of _ that _, I can assure you, he informed me himself.
He has been so unlucky as to lose _ your _ friendship, replied Elizabeth with emphasis, and in a manner which he is likely to suffer from all his life.
