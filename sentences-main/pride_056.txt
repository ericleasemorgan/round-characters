Neither duty, nor honour, nor gratitude, replied Elizabeth, have any possible claim on me, in the present instance.
If you believed it impossible to be true, said Elizabeth, colouring with astonishment and disdain, I wonder you took the trouble of coming so far.
Your coming to Longbourn, to see me and my family, said Elizabeth coolly, will be rather a confirmation of it; if, indeed, such a report is in existence.
Whatever my connections may be, said Elizabeth, if your nephew does not object to them, they can be nothing to _ you _.
These are heavy misfortunes, replied Elizabeth.
