It was impossible for her to enter on such a subject; and yet, after a pause, feeling the necessity of speaking, and having not the smallest wish for a total change, she only deviated so far as to say -- You were a good while at Lyme, I think ?
I should very much like to see Lyme again, said Anne.
Is not this song worth staying for ?
The last hours were certainly very painful, replied Anne; but when pain is over, the remembrance of it often becomes a pleasure.
This, said she, is nearly the sense, or rather the meaning of the words, for certainly the sense of an Italian love - song must not be talked of, but it is as nearly the meaning as I can give; for I do not pretend to understand the language.
